{"0": {"content": "There's always a huge line up for Soup Nutsy during around lunch time and after passing by it who knows how many times, I finally decided to give it a try. And wow, am I nuts for Soup Nutsy! First thing you'll notice is that there are so many soup options to choose from. Options are a mix of staples that are available every day and daily specials. They are also quite accommodating for people with dietary restrictions, as they have soup options that are dairy free, vegetarian, low fat, amongst other restrictions as well. My personal favourite soup is the chunky chicken noodle... comforting and perfect for a gloomy day! Soups come in three sizes: small (12 oz), medium (16 oz) and large (20 oz). Don't be fooled by the size of the small soup because it really is more filling than you would expect!Although prices may initially seem steep for soup, you do get a well balanced meal and in comparison to the other food options in the PATH, the quality of food for the price point is really hard to beat. For just under $10 you can get a combo which comes with a small soup and two sides (options include bread, buns, apples, and bananas). Or for just a couple dollars more (around $3 more), you can get a sandwich, side salad, quinoa bowl, or fruit bowl instead of sides. They also have a bunch of snacks like cookies, oatmeal, and loaves for decent prices as well.So if you're on the fence about Soup Nutsy like I was, I highly recommend you give it a try! The line up does start growing at around 11:30 am and remains consistently busy all throughout the lunch hour so I would suggest coming early or ordering off Ritual. Worth the extra effort, I promise!

Soup... so you'd think that is what their core business is... Soup. \u00c2\u00a0First time I tried this place, I made the mistake of arriving shortly after noon. \u00c2\u00a0Needless to say I was about 20-30 ppl back in the queue. \u00c2\u00a0My first thought was... well this is a good sign. \u00c2\u00a0So many ppl queued up, means it should be really good. \u00c2\u00a0I finally go to the point where I could order, I had picked up a pre-made sandwich from the cooler, and got a soup. \u00c2\u00a0I saw that they did some taste tests, but due to the number of ppl in the place, I decided not to try any, and just ordered. \u00c2\u00a0I had ordered, there were of course no spots to eat it, so I went back to the office. \u00c2\u00a0The soup was still volcano hot. \u00c2\u00a0However, it wasn't overly flavourful. \u00c2\u00a0Hmmmphf ! \u00c2\u00a0Go figure, being their core business, I would have thought it should be the best soup. \u00c2\u00a0The sandwich was good, but nothing overly fantastic either. \u00c2\u00a0I chalked it up to maybe it wasn't a good pick of a soup. \u00c2\u00a0About a month later, I decided to try it again. \u00c2\u00a0This time, I went before noon, was able to try a couple of the soups. \u00c2\u00a0Again, they were ok, but nothing fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0I had decided that I'd settle on one, and took that back to the office. \u00c2\u00a0Again, it was volcano hot, and again, it wasn't overly stellar. \u00c2\u00a0I gotta say, if your business is only soups, I would assume that you'd have something really fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0Again, I was disappointed. Overall, the price for the meal is a bit high, but I guess this is downtown Toronto. \u00c2\u00a0The soups I tried left me with a, meh, I've had better feeling. \u00c2\u00a0The sandwich was ok, but again, I'd rather pay for a freshly made sandwich instead of something that has sat in refrigeration all morning. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not feeling the love for the Soup Nutsy....

The bisque was so velvety and creamy in texture without being too rich in flavour. Every spoon was as good as the last! The shrimp flavour sung brightly throughout.

Nonetheless, everything smelled so good, I had to give it a shot.I got a chicken pot pie soup, which came with little pie bits you can add in. The soup was PIPING HOT, I couldn't start eating it until I was done my bread. Bread was nice and fluffy and tasted nice with the soup. Soup itself was GOOD. Very rich and creamy; chunky with chicken, veggies and potatoes in every bite. It wasn't a chowder like soup, but more like you took actual chicken pot pie filling, added just a tiny bit of liquid and there's your soup! It was so indulgent and filling, I felt like I didn't need dinner that night.The price on the high end for me, especially if you're getting the meat/seafood soups and the cup you get is a lot smaller than most places.

My impatience was immediately assuaged as I noticed the line was moving quicker than what I initially anticipated. Inside the establishment was a fairly simple set up consisting of a counter with rows of soup cauldrons and an assembly line of staff members pouring each patron a cup of their desired size and flavor. All soups come with a fruit/veggie bag + bread for roughly $8 (depending on what type of soup you get as meat, veggie, & seafood vary in price). They provide reusable soup nutsy bags that gives you 25 cents off on your next visit and also a loyalty card with the promise of 1 free small soup after the purchase of 10. The menu is pretty consistent offering an array of soups and a few seasonal changes and daily specials. That day I had a hankering for some crab so I ordered the Jamaican Crab Bisque. The small size soup is filling for lunch, especially since it is a thick soup. Smooth in texture, the creamy bisque was extremely flavorful with a hint of celery and spice. The chunks of crab meat in the soup were sweet and tender although scant throughout the cup. Overall, a delicious soup at a reasonable price for lunch in the PATH.
