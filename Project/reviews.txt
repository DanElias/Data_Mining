I chose the spicy grilled steak with regular rice and a side of gucamole. she asked if i wanted sour cream. not being too keen about it, i replied, \"just a little.\" she said, \"sorry, we don't do just a little...it's additional 50 cents.\" that's when the first wave of missing Chipotle came crashing over me. i already accepted the fact I had to pay additional $2 for my guac and also they don't have corn as an ingredient in the bowl so I didn't think I want to splurge anymore for my $13 meal. Quickly i ended my order before i could do anything else stupid like ordering an additional side of churros with chocolate dip. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes and i was happy to find that they offer chipotle medium hot sauce at the condiment table; there were also sliced Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o and diced red onion plus 2 other kind of sauces. It was a good 30 minutes before i could eat and the bowl stayed pretty warm in the eco friendly to-go container.

They are also quite accommodating for people with dietary restrictions, as they have soup options that are dairy free, vegetarian, low fat, amongst other restrictions as well. My personal favourite soup is the chunky chicken noodle... comforting and perfect for a gloomy day! Soups come in three sizes: small (12 oz), medium (16 oz) and large (20 oz). Don't be fooled by the size of the small soup because it really is more filling than you would expect!Although prices may initially seem steep for soup, you do get a well balanced meal and in comparison to the other food options in the PATH, the quality of food for the price point is really hard to beat. For just under $10 you can get a combo which comes with a small soup and two sides (options include bread, buns, apples, and bananas). Or for just a couple dollars more (around $3 more), you can get a sandwich, side salad, quinoa bowl, or fruit bowl instead of sides. They also have a bunch of snacks like cookies, oatmeal, and loaves for decent prices as well.So if you're on the fence about Soup Nutsy like I was, I highly recommend you give it a try!

I posted a picture with this review showing the Queso I received and a picture from their website showing the Queso I should have received. I also posted a picture of the Boneless Wings they sent that were not only burnt but hard as a rock and as cold as a winters night. And add to all of this everything was cold. DoorDash evidently follows up with its customers to see if you were happy not only with their service but the food itself. I complain that the meal was terrible so terrible we tossed it in the trash. To DoorDash's credit they immediately issued me a 20 dollar credit but it should be Chili's making it right.

The other couple we were with gave their CC to pay their bill, and when she brought the receipt back to sign, the bill was $7 more.

Finally did! We came on a Sunday for brunch and it wasn't that busy. We got seated quickly in a booth in the bar area. I really liked the tiles they used for the table, it looked nice. Since it was our first time there it took us forever to decide what we wanted to order. On Sundays they had a $5 special which was 11 pieces of boneless chicken bites or 6-7 wings. It was pretty cheap so we got 2 servings of that with honey chipotle sauce. They used chicken breast for the pieces and the batter was made perfectly for these boneless bites. The honey chipotle sauce was really good too. A little sweet, little sour with a slight hint of spice. I originally wanted a burger but I still wasn't too hungry and wouldn't be able to finish so I got the 3 split appetizer to try which was about the same price as a burger. Of the 3, I got chicken crispers, Mexican spring rolls and burger sliders. The chicken crisper tastes like the boneless bites except chicken tender format. Burger sliders, like your normal burger but smaller. Mexican spring rolls had beans and salsa in it. I actually liked this the most. Was something unusual and new for us and it was flavourful. There were 3 dipping sauces (idk what they were and what you were supposed to dip what with) so I mixed and matched everything. All good! My boyfriend got the fajita mix which was a sizzling plate with veggies, rice, beans, steak slices, chicken slices, and shrimp along with the fajita sides and salsa. That dish was HUGE and he couldn't finish it. As for service, it's a little slow but we had a lot of time that day that we didn't mind.
