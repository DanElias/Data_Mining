by the famous Bak Chor Mee stall next door.Finally, I got to try it.Made a trip down to eat the Bak Chor Mee but was dismayed to see that the queue was the longest that I've ever seen. Granted, that it was a Saturday afternoon, I have no one to blame but myself for not going down earlier at 11am.I decided not to wait 1 hour for my noodles and hence decided to try Happy Chef. Like, finally yeah!Verdict:- Chicken Chop - Portion was huge and worth every penny of your $6. Chicken was grilled to perfection, tender, juicy and delicious all at the same time. They were overly-generous with the sauce, but I like it that way. The fries were Long John Silver standard (crispy on outside, soft on the inside). However, my only gripe was that the sauce had a heavy BBQ taste which was too 'sweet' for me. I would prefer something more savoury, especially for my meats. The other side of mash potatoes was unique - sauce was homemade and went well with the potatoes. I felt the potatoes was not mashed enough and a tad lumpy.- Fish & Chip - The fish was fresh but the portion was of average size. Fries was good as usual and the coleslaw fresh. I absolutely hate it when hawkers serve 3-day-old coleslaw, thinking they can get away with it by refrigerating it.*Note that for both dishes, you are allowed to choose 2 sides.It is rather sad to see that this coffeeshop thrives on the booming business of Bak Chor Mee and Happy Chef. While Happy Chef may collect 'spillover' clientale from Bak Chor Mee (like me!), I know of some who will purposely make the trip down just to savour the chops. The lone popiah stall stands miserably empty and the hawkers were swatting flies inside. Pity though, but alas that's the way the cookie cumbles!Great western food but will not make a trip down just to patronise this stall. For Bak Chor Mee, yes I will.","1":"I ordered mushroom chicken chop. It comes with 2 side dishes. I have chosen vegetables and fries. The servings are generous. Definitely value for money. It also comes with a piece of flavourful garlic bread and of course mushroom since it's a mushroom chicken chop :). The mushroom is finely sliced.","2":"The owner of Happy Chef learnt his culinary skills from years of working in a steakhouse in Macau. The lamb chops, steak, pork chops and chicken chop taste awesome. The mixed grill will allow first time customers to sample a taste of their different grilled meat.The side dishes are good, and his secret gravy for different kinds of meat really adds a strong flavor to the food. This is a no frills hole in the wall, and the price of SGD$6.50 - SGD$14.50 it's really reasonable for this high quality grille.","3":"Another reason besides going to Tai Hwa Kopi Tiam for Bak Chor Mee was to try the famous Western Food from Happy Chef. They serve a wide range of Hainanese-style Western food which has been drawing crowds from all over SingaporeOne of their popular items is the Chicken Kiev--deep fried chicken rolled with cheese and ham. At $9, I found the price steep initially but the portion was HUGE. The amount of gooey cheese right at the centre was very generous, and thus stealing the limelight from the leading actor, Mr Chicken. There was no doubts about the crispy chicken coating, but the cheese solidified very quickly and turned into a chewy rubber that dislodged from the chicken. The taste emerged neither from the chicken nor the cheese, but the HAM. Better eat while it is still hot.Nothing unique about the homemade mushroom sauce, as raved about in the video.Perhaps we should have ordered the Fish & Chips instead of Chicken Schnitzel $6. Despite the visible black pepper flecks, the chicken itself was bland and nearly tasteless. Did not help much by the salty chilli sauce. Though the entire cutlet was flawlessly fried, some parts of the chicken skin was uncoated evenly and became very soft & greasy . \u00c2\u00a0We wished we had KFC as we slogged through the characterless meat.I can't be sure whether standards have dropped since it's my first try. (The owners who made TV appearance were not there) Furthermore, I have only tried 2 out of the 30 dishes here. Food not exceptional but the Chicken Kiev is still the better out of the two. And I just realised there is an AMK outlet which is nearer to my area. Hopefully the chefs over there are happier.","4":"Great portions, great taste, and at a very reasonable cheap price! Lots of varieties and variations of the already-familiar western cuisine.","5":"I actually expected a lot better considering it was featured on TV along with the famous Taihua next to it. My gold standard for western hawker food is chicken chop, and I just thought that the chop was lacking in flavor and the chicken itself was not of top notch quality. I didn't really think the sauce was very good either, which tasted like a bad mix of ketchup and bbq sauce. I also tried a bite of the ribeye steak and was also disappointed. If I'm ever in the area, I'm gonna get the minced meat noodle next door even though it's a 40 minute wait!","6":"Right next to the popular Tai Hwa pork noodles is this shop that sells one of the best budget western foods around. The portions are generous for great tasting food at that price. I ordered the Cajun chicken, the steak of chicken was grilled to a moist perfection. Nice grill lines even. I will be back to try out the other dishes for sure, of which they have quite an extensive menu for such a small stall.","7":"Generous portions of meat. Instead of just coleslaw, they serve boiled carrots, broccoli and cabbages which are fresh and crunchy. Meat is tender and just nice. Food is served fast even during lunch time. Recommended to go!","8":"The chicken kiev is to die for, but it is quite expensive. The chicken parmesan is an equally finger-licking-good, more wallet-friendly alternative. The portions are generous, almost twice the size of ordinary coffee-shop fare. The mashed potatoes are quite well done, but they run out of them quite quickly.","9":"Malay style crispy duck was very good with copious about of fried chillies and green onions, so was grandma Wu spicy veggies. \u00c2\u00a0I have been here before and tried the sour plum duck, it is equally as good. \u00c2\u00a0The chef removes most of the large bones but there are still finer ones.","10":"Childhood memories never dies. Sounds dramatic but it's true! Kim Dae Mun had been around since my childhood relocating from various food courts in orchard over the years and finally settled down here in its own space.One may think that time may change the food, but no, the taste is still as what I remembered in my childhood - Fantastic.Love their bbq Pork\/Chicken hotplate cos the sauce really champs it all. Still affordable (according to the standards today) and standard maintained. Love love love!","11":"Was excited to go for lunch after reading reviews. Over priced, the fried dumplings had more rice noodles in them than pork. Not worth it.","12":"I was walking down Orchard Road and was lured in by the waft of authentic Korean food. Boy was I glad to have stumbled upon Kim Dae Mun. Great value for food that is family-owned by Koreans, most dishes are under $8 and portions are more than enough for one. They have a solid staple menu consisting of ramyeon, bi bim bap, soup, fried\/steam saba, and rice cakes, and tofu soup. Anyone is sure to find a dish here if they are into Korean food. There is also a small drinks stall to grab some soda or tea to wash down the spiciness. Great place that hits the spot as you browse the endless strip malls along Orchard.","13":"Tucked in one corner of Concorde Hotel, this place's customers are obviously those who know it and specially patronize it instead of just randomly passing by. The staff are Koreans and the food is reasonably priced for the quality. Many Korean restaurants have only spicy soup but this has non-spicy soup for people like me. The tofu and seafood were fresh. The broth was rather salty but I don't think it's because of MSG. After a while, the smoke from the kitchen got too overwhelming but you can just eat the good food and leave the smoky place. Haha.","14":"Haven't been to KDM since they moved from the food court to the 2nd floor but I was glad nothing much changed. Still the same ahjuma and her daughter manning the counter and same old dishes and great taste. Still an additional $0.50 if you want to change to red rice. I recommend you do that. It's much more flavorful :) Though the prices have increased, they remain rather reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. I need to return soon again to have my favorite steamed Saba. Not hungry enough this time to eat both!","15":"Kim Dae Mun is good value for cheap Korean food. A bibimbap sets you back by only $7.50. I tried the hot plate squid, chicken sets and the portions were generous. There is not much ambience however as the new set up feels like a worker's canteen but no one is complaining. I recommend Kim Dae Mun for the best value Korean set meals under $10. The side dish is your choice of kimchi, anchovies or pickled cucumbers.","16":"The stall is located at the food court which is at the basement of the meridian hotel, beside the istana. This stall serves great authentic Korean food and even the staff and owners are Koreans. They are sincere and friendly while taking your orders.Their kimchi ramen is excellent, the soup is well flavored and the ramen is cooked nicely, giving a great texture and not too soggy or spongy. The fried glass noodle is also another recommended dish to try. If you do not take spicy stuff, do remember to tell the owner as this dish will be pretty hot.Price is affordable and definitely value for money. But do not that the queue during peak hours might be excruciating long.","17":"Phenomenal from beginning to end. The flavors of most of the dishes were just beautiful and unique, the feel of the restaurant being as if I eating inside the kitchen of a huge restaurant, and the service was kind and generous. Highly recommend.I was caught off guard by this experience as I recently lost much of my intrigue with Michelin Stars in Singapore but found this one to be spot on.Reservations for weekday seatings were very easy via their website which I believe uses Quandoo. We simply made a 7:30 res and took an Uber to the restaurant where we walked into a giant kitchen with only 6-8 tables in the entire dining room. At the time there was only one other seated party of 2, later there was a party of 4.My friend and I ordered the following:1) Pasta with Razor clams - This one is a MUST. WOW.2) Pasta with Uni or Crab - Pass on this one. Get the razor clam one3) Pasta with Barnacles - Unfortunately I misunderstood the waitress. Thought she said the barnacles are prepared by itself, not with another course of pasta. The barnacles were very good but I would suggest you not get it with pasta if you already ordered the razor clams.4) Roasted Pigeon - Best pigeon I've had, not gamey at all. 5) Wild Snapper - Excellent6) Strawberry Cheesecake - Fluffy, light, pink, Instagram worthy7) Their signature dessert (Starts with a G) - Very rich. Nice flavor but the sweetness is a bit much after the first bite.They also provided us a special Italian bread that they fly in every week from Italy.The chef is actually there and serves us himself many of the dishes. I love restaurants like this, very personal. Because the kitchen is right in front of you and in a sense, invades your space, you feel like you are watching a TV show with your food being prepared. It's awesome.The Boat Quay location is wonderful as well but can be hard to find. Keep an eye out for the signage and your Google Maps.Only negative at the moment is the quality of their cocktails if you do visit their rooftop bar. I ordered the bramble which was horribly sweet for a simple bramble (although the blackberry ice sphere was cool). My friend got one of the Sours which tasted awful. We barely drank them and left, hopefully it was a one time thing.","18":"One of the more underwhelming michelin restaurants Ive experienced (Im not counting Hawker Chan, since that should have been only a bib gourmand). There were some highs and lows, with a bill that doesnt justify a five course meal. The amuse Bouche set the tone with the chefs preference for sweet and savory. It was nice to have a geographical expedition in regional tastes of Italy stretched across a placard. The beef tartine was a delightful, playful twist in cherries. The beef marrow butter and beef itself were draped in cherry smoke, creating this illusion of a buttery cherry pie.The langoustine was another example of sweet and savory. This time, the interplay between cocoa nibs, coconut milk sauce, and fish all leaned heavily upon southeast Asia and nods to Africa. Creamy, sultry, crispy, with the seafood still in the forefront. Although it doesn't feel Italian, it definitely tastes good. If they added sugar, it could be a dessert!The haiddako snapper was a sharp turn towards a more conservative dish. Much more familiarity in the ingredients and presentation. The tomato, pepper, and relish combo felt like a deck of cards fanned out, all creating this image of an olive; A tasty olive none the less! The fish stood its ground among the flavors, especially with some help from the caviar. The uni crab pasta dish was boring. For what had the most expensive items on the menu didn't match to taste. The pasta wasn't al dente, the crab barely stood out, and the uni didn't sing. A misstep for sure with the pacing of this meal. The wagyu beef wasn't breaking barriers in presentation, but damn do the classics sound good when played right. The yolk was essential to the meal. It was the goo of life that brought these inanimate pieces of food to life in my mouth. The mustard and black garlic were placed on the outside of the plate like an art palate for me to brush my meat into. The meat itself was butter soft, juicy, and full of beef flavor. The only real enhancement could have been a crust on the outside. The white chocolate Was a fruity dish in disguise. Even though the ball of white chocolate is the main attraction, it was a fairly blank, buttery canvas to push the raspberries straight to the forefront. Plenty of low tone tartness to go around.I liked my meal, but I wasnt delighted like I normally am from a michelin starred restaurant. I have nothing against this talented chef, but I dont think this place was as progressive as it claims.","19":"Wonderful, sit on the top floor for the view (I think it's a bar but you can eat there). Both lunch and dinner are great. Staff and chef were friendly and attentive. Food was fun. Especially liked the pigeon and desert (forgot what it was called) the last time I was there.","20":"We went for the Menu Gourmand - the composition of which varies as you indicate to the chef which dish(es) from the \u00c3\u00a0 la carte menu you may wish to have. The food is among the most refined and subtle Italians you'll find in Singapore. However, what makes Braci truly unique is, because the restaurant is so small, you can engage in conversations with the staff, and especially with the talented and enthusiastic polyglot chef Beppe De Vito, a real artist. If Braci were larger (and demonstrate it could achieve the same quality with scale), it would have two Michelin stars, not one. That said, although the dishes are innovative, beautifully plated and refined, the nearby Osteria Art (also owned by chef Beppe) serves more hearty Italian meals (especially the pastas, which are the best in Singapore!) Incidentally, very good wine list, with many 'reasonably-priced' Brunello's and Barolo's.","21":"Relatively short menu, but everything is cooked in an innovative way and plated like art. The risotto is sublime. Impressive ratio of chefs to guests. Service is outstanding, with a chef coming to your table to explain EVERY single dish. Perhaps the best one-Michelin-starred restaurant in Singapore. If the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was a bit more formal, it should have two.","22":"This bistro serves traditional French food. The staff were very friendly and attentive without hovering over you. I had the lobster bisque to start. The flavor was perfect and there was plenty of lobster pieces to eat along the way. Next I had the beef casserole with mash. Very tasty and filling. By now I am full but with a cheese trolley full of different types I've never tried before, I couldn't resist. I got 5 cheeses.I could barely move. Such a great meal with good atmosphere. Recommended for people wanting traditional French food.","23":"Classic bistrot d\u00c3\u00a9cor (with French music in the background) and classic bistrot food - nothing particularly innovative (so, for instance, no sweetbread or rabbit), just well-executed traditional brasserie dishes. We had the escargots, foie gras po\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9, entrec\u00c3\u00b4te grill\u00c3\u00a9e, confit de canard, and tarte fine aux poires, and they're all yummy. Reasonable pricing; the set lunch represents great value. Decent wine list. Add to this friendly service. Fir sure, we will go back.","24":"I've been wanting to try Taratata for awhile, as the menu looked promising. \u00c2\u00a0It's classic French, and the restaurant enjoys a prime location on Keong Saik Road. \u00c2\u00a0And inside, it looks like a classic bistro. \u00c2\u00a0Stopped by for lunch earlier, and while the menu looked good, the execution was not as good. \u00c2\u00a0I started off with French Onion soup which was ok, but the portion was quite small. \u00c2\u00a0The main was a pork chop, but it was underseasoned, and the presentation was very underwhelming (see my photo). \u00c2\u00a0And while they had a decent wine list, charging $30 for the cheapest red wine by the glass seems a bit too much, even in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0So overall, while the ambiance and menu hits the mark, the execution does not. \u00c2\u00a0And with wine prices among the highest that I have encountered in Singapore, the price-value ratio isn't there either.","25":"Dining out is an experience that involves many senses. You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center.","26":"Classic and traditional French bistrot. Dishes were well-prepared but nothing spectacular. Decor is a little tacky and cheap-looking, to be honest. Wine list decent, reasonable prices and OK selection, but nothing really too interesting. Overall, this was a 3-star experience, but I'm deducting a star because one of the servers kept messaging my personal number after the meal, it was really creepy!","27":"I've been on the lookout for good french food in Singapore and this place turns out to be that little gem where you can make a reservation relatively last-minute (about an hour before) and still get a seat for Friday evening dinner. And the food and wine are both good and at a \"reasonable\" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The \"house wine\" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!","28":"Taratata Bistrot is a charming little French restaurant along Keong Saik Road which I've been meaning to try for sometime. I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal.","29":"Was there during Restaurant Week so the value was really really good : $35++ for the whole meal, with a very good seared tuna first, then an okay salmon and a great apple crumble for dessert.Would definitely recommend it for a proper french bistrot dinner experience at a reasonable price (compared to fine dining), about S$150 for a dinner for two with some wine I would say.","30":"Perfect French bistrot, 2 French chefs, Bertrand and Philippe gave us a memorable classic and authentic French dinner.The lamb cutlets were so tasty, i found them better than some i had in a 3 stars michelin in France. A very nice cheese selection, reasonable and excellent wine list.Friendly and professional service.We will come back, we were back to France for few hours!!! Thank you.","31":"It was a great experience even though we skipped the mains and had 3 appetisers plus four desserts. French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly.","32":"So good, I came for dinner two nights in a row.The first night was pretty busy, but thankfully the reservation held, and we were shown to our seats promptly. The Girlfriend was quite taken with the European-looking wait staff, and his (French?) accent, so looks like there were points there for authenticity. The fam joined us for night 2, and we had a lovely booth to ourselves.Food was not an easy pick - there is a lot to choose from, and almost all of it sounded lovely! Over the two nights, we had loads: the cassolette of escargot was super tasty, especially with the garlicky mushrooms; the mackerel fillet was light, and the accompaniments added great balance (thumbs up for the dressing!); the lamb rack, pork trotter, boeuf bourguigon, and roasted chicken leg? All of it disappeared.Some say dessert is the measure of a complete meal, and perhaps they need a bit more work here. We didn't enjoy these as much - the Grand Marnier Souffle packed too heavy a punch for me, while the ice nougat was a new experience, but not much to shout about. Perhaps the starters and mains had already blown our tastebuds away. The shining light was the homemade lavender ice cream - that really cleaned up the palate after some heavyweight mains, and was quite a delight to finish.Service did well by me and the fam too, Manager Jovy made her rounds, and the two fellas were engaging and polite as they navigated the dining room.They've just started a Sunday lunch menu, which promises a lot of family style food - right up my alley. Now, to round up the kinfolk...Oh and check for credit card promotions! No better way to round off a dining experience eh?","33":"Several friends had gushed about Taratata so when it came time for a girls' night out, F suggested we check out Taratata. The restaurant is cosy and the service is good so I was looking forward to trying the food.Had the pan fried duck foie gras with caramelised pears which was quite good followed by the grilled Angus rib eye with cognac black pepper sauce. Thought it was decent but thought the steak began to taste a bit bland halfway through, unlike certain places like Bedrock and Gordon Grill where the steak remains tasty throughout. F had the beef flank steak with shallot sauce and quite liked it. We skipped on dessert as we were too full.Wasn't blown away but might come back to try other dishes.","34":"Where to begin. I'll start with the food. Overall it was pretty good. The french onion soup was awesome. Not the best I ever had which was almost orgasmic but this was very tasty. Couldve used a little more cheese but oh well. \u00c2\u00a0My cassoulet was pretty good. I had never had one before so dont know what to compare it to. I wouldnt say the flavor was jumping in my mouth but it was a good dish. \u00c2\u00a0The dessert was a great warm chocolate cake with loads of chocolate oozing out. \u00c2\u00a0The wine was good and the ambiance was nice and relaxed. A good spot for a date. I have mixed feelings about this restaurant though. \u00c2\u00a0I dont want to be jaded by maybe what was a bad night for them. But I thought the service was sub par. \u00c2\u00a0I felt the manager was great and attentive. She gave great recommendations and was working hard. I felt like she was running the whole restaurant. I dont know what the other servers were doing. It took 20 min to process our credit cards and we were the only ones left in the restaurant. Its too bad because everything else was really nice. \u00c2\u00a0Like I said, maybe it was a bad night for them. If you enjoy french cuisine I'd try it for sure.","35":"I was brought on a date the first time, and I was rather charmed by the bistro setting that definitely reminded me of my stay in Paris not \u00c2\u00a0too long ago. The waiters were all dressed up and the warm lighting inside with tables tightly packed were quintessentially Parisian. The menu did not disappoint. Good old classics like Coq Au Vin, Confit de Canard, Escargots and Soupe a l'Oignon got me excited. The mackerel salad had caught my eye as I remember a rather delicious variant when I was visiting the French Countryside. I went with that, as well as the Poulet Rot\u00c3\u00ae ( Orast Chicken) for my main course.The Mackerel Fillet marinated in white wine with scented potatoes salad had been so stunning, that was all I could think of since then. The perfumed salad had a light floral and earthy taste, possibly the doing of a herb infused oil. The fish was not the least fishy and it was delicate and soft, marrying perfectly with the potatoes that were lightly dressed. The greens and garnishing herbs were light in flavour not too overpowering, lending a great touch to the delicate textures of the dish. The main course were impressive, enough to leave an impression and a longing to be back.I manage to catch a glimpse of the lunch menu that seemed very economical at just $30 for three course. This is cheaper than the usual lunch set menus in Parisian bistro and with the quality of the dinner there, I am sure to go back to try their lunch!","36":"Nice Ambience and excellent & attentive service. \u00c2\u00a0Classic dishes done right - Escargot, French Onion Soup and Creme Br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e. \u00c2\u00a0Worth a try - good for dinner party or a quiet date. \u00c2\u00a0The set dinner menu was good value for money. \u00c2\u00a0On a very happening street.","37":"Great place for quick breakfast. Sausage roll is my favorite. Kopi Peng (local iced coffee) is my favorite.","38":"Kaya Toast is life. What is Kaya? It's like a jam made out of coconut and egg, spread between to pieces of toast. Order it as a set with eggs and coffee! That way, you can dip the toast in soft boiled eggs for a classic Singapore breakfast. We prefer Ya Kun for getting Kaya Toast just because the coffee is better there. But toast box offers this other item, toast with ham, cheese, and egg, and they flame torch the cheese. It's SO good!","39":"Chain serving kaya toast and traditional coffee \/ tea (Kopi \/ Teh) in Singapore. Both are pretty good but personally I prefer Yakun (another famous chain serving similar items). They also serve laksa, other bakery (cake, brownies, etc.) and other drinks (would recommend the barley drink). The venue in MBS is very convenient for a shopping break","40":"I came here because it was ultra busy and wanted to see what the crowd is about. The place is very cute and coffee house like place that services light bites, drinks and desserts. It's great because it's one of few places that actually opens early...7:30am. I got the laska soup and a black tea. Both were fine for the price which was only 7.50 sgd. I wouldn't say it was anything special though. Bottom line..come for the ambience or a safe place to grab a bite or drink early in the morning. ProsIn a shopping mall in the basement so it's easy to get to Affordable Cons Food is just ok Tea is just ok","41":"I was referred to this place by a local and it was quick, and decent in satisfying my cravings for Laksa. Next time I might venture out of the mall but for the price I am not unhappy. The coffee is strong, the Laksa filling..","42":"Singaporean faves. Easy, quick, and cheap. The laksa was alarmingly delicious, and the kaya toast was simply delectable. Even the kopi is tasty!","43":"I usually go simple at Toast Box with just kaya toast (sometimes with eggs) and a milk tea or kopi. This Toast Box near Esplanade was quite good. The seating area is pretty spacious and the aunties at the counter were soooo friendly to me, which is a step up from other Toast Boxes I've been to. As usual the kaya toast was good for a quick snack and the milk tea is always refreshing.","44":"Toast Box is a nice stop for a break during the workday as they offer all sorts of little snacks and drinks. \u00c2\u00a0The seating here is shared with other restaurants in the this \"food court\" area.I had the plum soda which was refreshing, but very much too sweet. \u00c2\u00a0All the sweet \"plum\" stuff is at the bottom, so make sure you stir it up really well. \u00c2\u00a0They also have kopi\/coffe, Milo, barley tea, and various other hot and cold drinks.Not much else to be said about Toast Box - extremely affordable, air-conditioned, food court-type pick-me-up during the work day type of place.","45":"Freshly brewed Nanyang coffee and a lemon cheese bun is the best! The smell is intoxicating and the taste will delight even the most hard core coffee critics.I am already sad about not having a Toast Box back home in Seattle.Try the authentic toast with peanut butter or the coconut egg tart. Both delicious! Just like their slogan, \u00c2\u00a0you will say \"Toast Box....I like.\"","46":"I'm a fan of this place. For a food-court type of cafe in almost all the malls, this place is not pricey, it maintains a very clean and lovely image, and the food is good.The citylink location can get quite busy at lunch (though, given my observations at raffle city, not as much). \u00c2\u00a0I went there at around 1pm to grab some food and there was nowhere to sit. The people who work there were extremely friendly though, and tried to get me to wait for a bit for a seat, but I opted to get the takeout anyway.Admittedly, what attracted me there in the first place was their large sign for Laksa. I realize the danger in getting laksa in a place called Toast Box, but I was not disappointed. The laksa was creamy and flavourful, and they were not stingy on the ingredients. For $4.50, that's pretty incredible. I also really wanted to try the Kaya toast there, and for $1.40 - why not? And traditional milk tea for $1? Awesome. The kaya was really really buttery though, so if i get a chance to go back, i'd request for less butter. It was delicious, nevertheless.Thumb up!","47":"The lava egg tart is probably the best thing i have ever had. \u00c2\u00a0The crust is flakey and a little sweet and when you bite into the tart the egg yolk will run out of the center of the tart so hold it close to \u00c2\u00a0your mouth so you can let it drip onto your tongue \u00c2\u00a0and not onto your tie.","48":"In desperate need for a sugar hit, a cold drink, and some air conditioning after a Sunday morning of walking around we stumbled across this Toast Box which was the only thing in the area that was open. While I was initially skeptical as I knew it was a chain store, I loved the decor and was absolutely parched.The menu was extensive and I will forever regret not ordering the Milo toast. I'd already had kaya toast that morning though, so went with the banana cake. It was a generous size serve and fresh, light and fluffy. Just what I needed. I also ordered a delicious lemon and lime drink with tapioca pearls upon recommendation from the guy behind the counter. It was absolutely perfect, and easily some of the best pearls I've had which surprised me a lot!My partner ordered the kaya toast set with kopi and I felt happy with my choices. He said they were okay, but the kopi wasn't as great as we've previously had.","49":"When I first came to Singapore, I was instantly brought here by my friends. They kept on telling me that Toast Box is like the first place to go to upon arrival. So they brought me to the branch in Suntec City. I think it was a good idea. I liked the Milo toast personally.","50":"Go for the double boiled soups - homey brewed goodness.The signature popiah is pretty good too - packed with tasty turnip and crunchy garlic and cracker bits. Would rather they use shrimp rather than the crab stick though.The assam fish is meh. But the noodle dishes are usually pretty good.","51":"This was a decent lunch. \u00c2\u00a0At work, a colleague told me about this place. \u00c2\u00a0I live near OG. \u00c2\u00a0I needed a quick solo lunch. \u00c2\u00a0So, I thought I would give it a try.It is kind of hidden away in the back corner of the second floor of OG. \u00c2\u00a0It was not difficult to find though. When I arrived, the restaurant was less than half full. \u00c2\u00a0I was quickly seated and provided a menu. \u00c2\u00a0For such a small and hidden away place, Granny's Secret has quite an extensive menu.Soon after, my order was taken. \u00c2\u00a0I selected the \"Traditional Hokkien Mee\" and a lime juice.My lime juice and a water were quickly brought out. \u00c2\u00a0It wasn't long before my food followed. \u00c2\u00a0I was asked if I wanted some red or green chili and they were supplied.I do not know what Traditional Hokkien Mee is exactly supposed to be. \u00c2\u00a0So, I can only judge if I liked it. \u00c2\u00a0I did \u00c2\u00a0The bunch of spicy red peppers I dumped in helped quite a bit. \u00c2\u00a0Otherwise, it might have been a bit bland. \u00c2\u00a0It included mushrooms, pork, prawns, fish, and tofu. \u00c2\u00a0There were some basic veggies also. \u00c2\u00a0I enjoyed thhe noodles. \u00c2\u00a0I pretty much ate the whole thing. \u00c2\u00a0 I thought the portion was filling.tinyurl.com\/9gj8vjvI would note that one could probably get the same dish at the same quality at a hawker centre for less money. \u00c2\u00a0The ambiance is very basic and functional. \u00c2\u00a0It is clean and neat.The service was friendly and helpful.Will I go back? \u00c2\u00a0I probably will. \u00c2\u00a0But only because of convenience. \u00c2\u00a0It is not a destination restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0However, \u00c2\u00a0if you are shopping in OG, and you are hungry and do not mind spending a dollar or two more, then it is a nice little option for lunch.","52":"The restaurant lacks decorations but the place was bright and was air conditioned. The food display welcomes you as you walk in.The speciality of this place is the large plate of Javanese rice and dishes. The large plates comes enough for two persons or for four persons. We had the large plate.On the large plate was a raw bean sprouts dish, fried fish, fried potatoes, curry chicken, beef rendang, chilli egg plant, long bean and fried bean vegetables, Sambal prawn, sambal spring (squid), chilli coconut, chilli peanuts and large amount of rice in the middle.The overall taste was good given the amount of dishes included in the large plate. Surprisingly the rice was soft and warm but some of the dishes was not too fresh or at room temperature. Those probably done earlier in the morning and we were having dinner. The vegetables were mostly at room temperature. The chilli peanuts were not fresh and the peanuts were already not crispy. However the curry chicken was warm and the taste was very good. They gave us half a chicken worth of curry. The beef rendang was also very tasty and the meat was soft and tender. The rendang gravy goes very well with the rice. The fun starts when the large plate comes to the table and every body dig into the one plate !Overall food was great and recommended.","53":"Saturday late lunch, went here with my cousin, his wife and my Mum. \u00c2\u00a0My cousin ordered the BIG PLATTER for 4 adults consumption. \u00c2\u00a0This establishment offers the Nasi Ambeng. \u00c2\u00a0Since there are 4 of us, they provide like 4 huge pieces of Shrimp, 4 pieces of PARU (Beef Lungs), 4 pieces of bergedil aka potato patties, and all other fixings that is norm for the Nasi Ambeng. \u00c2\u00a0If I could recall correctly, these include Beef Rendang, Udang aka Prawns or Shrimp, Ayam Masak Lemak aka Chicken, Paru aka Beef Lungs, Sambal Terung aka Spicy Eggplants, Urap, Serunding, Sambal Ikan Bilis and Kacang to name a few.In terms of pricing, I cannot recall coz it was my Cousin treating my Mum and I. \u00c2\u00a0Maybe it was like with tax less than $60 Lunch for 4 person.Parking can be hassle in this area, though there are multi-storey car park nearby. \u00c2\u00a0In terms of the portion and taste it's Doable. \u00c2\u00a0Can-LAH! \u00c2\u00a0Though I cannot deny for the first 10 minutes after we received the food, the staffs kept \"pestering\" or \"interupting\" us whether we can be photographed for their \"customers wall of fame\" posted inside the establishment. \u00c2\u00a0Oh well... \u00c2\u00a0I guess this is how they - the restaurant get their publicity to the masses.This establishment is air-conditioned. \u00c2\u00a0That is GOOD in my books, so we can dine in at a cooling area. \u00c2\u00a0While having our Late Lunch, some Malay background music was being played. \u00c2\u00a0When the dining area is packed to the brim, this establishment can be so loud at times due to the location.Take note : \u00c2\u00a0If you intend to dine during the weekends, do call them in advance so you can make your reservation. \u00c2\u00a0Hence plan accordingly.PU351 Bencoolen St#01-06Singapore 189630Tel : +65 63384419","54":"A quiet, understated restaurant, I've found my new favourite restaurant in town. This is a cosy restaurant in beige, both the furnishing and the waiter\/waitresses. The food, like the service, is excellent, unpretentious and of good value. This is a place perfect if you love a quiet evening of good food, no frills, and want to focus on just your food and company. My first assessment of a restaurant's quality is the bread basket. I believe if a restaurant puts the effort to serve good warm bread that comes free, it can't go very wrong. And we polished off the bread. We weren't even that hungry. The Caesar salad with anchovies was so unassuming, we were a little disappointed at first glance. But once we started, we couldn't stop. The quail was exquisite. Paired with foie gras, and balanced with walnuts and beetroot, it was flavorful and yet not over-powering. Slightly crispy skin and juicy inside. I ate this 2 weeks ago and I still dream of it. I was reluctant to order the chicken at first, because well, it's chicken. Chicken to me is usually a safe choice, can't go very wrong, but not fantastic either. But Gordon Grill's grilled farm chicken as brought chicken to a whole new level. Once again, flavorful, juicy, not oily, and brought out the taste of chicken so well. The chicken melted in my mouth. I thought I died and went to chicken heaven. The grilled pork was pink with perfection. I can't go on further without my mouth watering again. Every dish we had was prepared with thought and care, it was evident. This place is as if it stopped in time where quiet dignity and taking pride in preparing a quality filling meal were cherished. I can't wait to go back there.","55":"Fine dining with great service, lovely facility, and excellent food! \u00c2\u00a0It's pricey which keeps most of the riffraff out - this means you can get a table at the last minute and enjoy a quiet meal with out jostling for position. \u00c2\u00a0 The staff is adequately trained and do their best to make it a special eventing. \u00c2\u00a0The food is a nice fusion of continental and new American and everything taste wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0They love to provide table service for everything from the salmon carpaccio to the crepes Suzette. \u00c2\u00a0Wine list isn't too exhaustive but it has what you nee. \u00c2\u00a0Their steaks are super tinder and done just as you like. \u00c2\u00a0Flawless evening that will let you pay the big bill without too much regret.","56":"Gordon Grill is a stalwart of the Singapore dining scene ; solid, dependable with comforting with great service and equally great food. We might be occasionally distracted by the new trendy restaurants popping up on the dining scene, but when it comes to deciding on a place where it's cosy, peaceful and reliable, we head straight for Gordon Grill.Food : We always look forward to the crispy snack they provide along with the bread basket. I don't know what it's called but it's uber yummy! I also really like the bread basket. I'm a huge fan of the chilled angel hair pasta with king crab and caviar. One can opt to have it prepared warm as well, but I prefer the chilled version. The lobster bisque is lovely but the highlight of my meal is naturallement, the grilled ribeye. The Snake River Farm wagyu is one of the best ribeye steaks I've had in Singapore (Fat Cow uses the same one we had done charcoal grill style) and they bring it out on the beef trolley to show you the marbling and ask you how much of it you want. Half the fun of having the crepes Suzette is watching it done table side and it's always done really well.Ambience : Cosy and peaceful without loud music or loud conversation. It might be fine dining but it's not overly formal.Service : One of the best. They make it a point to recognise their customers and their preferences. I approve. All service in Singapore should aspire to their standards.I make it a point to try and go at least once a month. You should too!","57":"Gordon grill is a perennial favorite of mine from the old days. They had a complete revamp some years ago with a new chef Gan Swee Lai. A completely new menu. The set for lunch is affordable at $50 and $60 for 4 and 5 courses respectively. The food is very good and portions are very generous. A great meal and worth a visit for all occasions.","58":"Not your typical noodle shop in the mall. This placE doesn't use as much (MSG in their broth) compared to other noodle stall. I ordered #16 Braised Beef Noodle Spicy and it was surprisingly good! The beef was tender and noodle was chewy ( saw the Chef cut the noodles into the boiling water). It's worth checking out","59":"Authentic French food in a simple restaurant. Sometimes as Singaporeans, we just want good food that is value for money. Atmosphere is a plus but it's not something that one needs all the time. La Petite offers you great French food at reasonable price in a casual setting where you can just be yourself.You don't need to go to a fancy restaurant for great French cuisine, cos La Petite offers it all. We had the lamb rack and it was truly divine. Flavourful seasoning, right char and overall great taste. Located not too far away from the Botanical gardens, one can even take a slow walk after the meal and continue to reflect on the meal.","60":"Confit de Canard ($22) - 3.5 starsHaven't had this in a while; the texture is still good - it's crisp on the outside and generally moist on the inside (though still a bit dry). However, it was the gamey duck taste that disappointed. The potato gratin was creamy and buttery and I felt a little ill after.Cheese Macaroni with Crab Meat ($19.50) - 2.5 starsThe sauce was too creamy and didn't have much flavour. Couldn't quite taste the crab meat.","61":"Third visit 25 May 2017Spaghetti w\/ fresh crab meat in lightly spicy tomato sauce ($16.50) - 2.5 starsWas disappointed this visit - there was very little crab in the pasta and the sauce was too sharply tomato-y, as if the pasta had been thrown into tomato paste from a can. Again, it could use some spice and they don't have tabasco sauce or any chili available. Ambience is nice though.=====================================Second visit 21 Feb 2017Spaghetti w\/ fresh crab meat in lightly spicy tomato sauce ($16.50) - 4 starsA hefty amount of fresh crab meat and a PILE of spaghetti. I wanted to but stopped myself from finishing this thankfully. Even then I definitely had no room for island creamery next door! The flavor was good but not as spicy as I would've liked. There's something missing - similar to their duck confit above - that makes the food short of 5 stars. I can't quite put my finger on it but it tastes more like good comfort food than fine dining. It would be nice if the male server was friendlier... because I'm paying with the entertainer app I really am not bothered, but if I were paying full price I would think twice before heading here.Salmon with spinach and rice ($17.50) - 4.25 starsThe salmon was excellent! Light and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. The portion was fairly small though - especially the 3 leaves of spinach - so my plus one was left a little hungry (perfect because he helped me with my dish!)=====================================First visitDuck confit canard ($17.50) - 4 starsLoved the crispy skin and the meat was tender. They also gave a MOUND of potato gratin. It had too much butter for me so the next time I'm going to try asking for salad instead.Update: they'll do a salad for an additional $1! Worth it.Cute cosy place, and best of all we could use the entertainer app!","62":"Duck confit canard ($17.50) - 4 starsLoved the crispy skin and the meat was tender.

In the same spirit as the supermarkets: Spartan d\u00c3\u00a9cor; order and pay upfront at the cashier's; reasonable pricing (except for wine). This used to be THE place where to get cheap French food in Singapore. It has since been surpassed on all fronts by the Saveur chain, which has similar pricing, but offers more convenient locations, service, and most importantly, more diverse and better-quality good.","65":"A reasonably priced French bistro (dishes range from $15 to $25) with all the classic trimmings. We had Broccoli, and potato soup, Duck Confit, and the tuna steak. Everything was well done. The pan sauce from the Duck had a particularly zesty flavor that really worked. The interior is nice with casual bistro seating and self-service water. It's doesn't feel high-end, but think nice casual.","66":"La Petite Cuisine serves a decent French Cuisine, authentic and unpretentious. They are humbly situated in one of the old school malls in Bukit Timah Area and are known for its affordability and quality.By chance, we were there on one of the weekday nights and decided to give it a try since we have pass by the place so many times and the crowd in the restaurant was rather convincing.Furnishing was not really modern but still presentable in its own style. They have black board mounted on to the \"bricks-lookalike\" tiles indicating the specials serving of the day.Without looking much into their ala carte menu, we decided on the Weekday Set dinner at $24 which we thought was pocket friendly as there is no GST and service charge. Plain water are self-service and are reachable from the drinks counter. The dinner \u00c2\u00a0set is rather straight forward with 2 choices of appetizer, mains and desserts each.Getting the best of both worlds we order 2 sets and tried everything for the set dinner during that day.My first try of Orange Carrot Soup was pleasing, it tasted sweet more than of a citrus taste that I would have expected. They were served tongue burning hot and goes indeed well dipping the mini baguettes.The stomach comforting Ravioli of spinach among the light creamy sauce was a good reminisce of my France trip. The straight forward dish without much fanciful creations in the dish is somehow what I'm looking for. Decent and down to earth.One of the set was served with rice, spinach and Salmon Filet in cream sauce. Cream sauce is light and taste is identical to what was being used in the Ravioli dish. Salmon was cooked perfectly with crispy skin and pinkish on the inside.Comparing this main course to the salmon, I would have prefer this dish more. The steak was chewy and tender. The mushroom sauce reveals some hints of wine in it gave a perfect match to the Sirlion Steak. The stomach fillers in the dish will be the potato grains.The wobbly panna cotta as our desserts was a sweet ending to the meal. I don't have a sweet tooth, thus the caramelized top layer isn't really for me.Overall, La Petite Cuisine is a commendable place and for sure I will recommend to my friends who wants to have some authentic french cuisine without breaking the pocket.","67":"I was told not to expect good service but just to enjoy the food. So I went not expecting much. The place was really tiny! It was not a proper restaurant with a shop shell. Instead the kitchen\/cashier counter seemed to take up the entire proper shop space, so the tables were actually outside that space. Quite a strange layout as it looked like people could just enter and walk through to get inside Serene Centre.With just 5-6 small tables inside, they really cannot accommodate big groups or take reservations. I think once people realize that, they will not and should not expect the restaurant to accede to their requests.Maybe we were lucky but the service was good when we were there. At 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, only a few tables were occupied, so we were able to get a table immediately. We were greeted in French by the French chef-owner who was sitting by the door. He was a bit quirky caustic with a bit of mischievous fun, very French, when interacting with the diners. Definitely not those amiable and super friendly chefs in other family style restaurants. We were given the menu, and complimentary warm crusty rolls with butter were served shortly after we placed our order at the cashier. The bread was fabulous, very fresh and set the tone for the hearty meal. Water was available near the cashier, self serve. Specials of the day were posted on the board at the cashier. I had the beef bourguignon which was the best I ever tasted in Singapore. It did not have the burnt bovril taste. The stew had a natural beefiness and smooth finish, with melt in your mouth meat. I did not need to use the knife at all. It came with a bowl of al dente spaghetti which was generously coated with butter (I think) so it was quite tasty on its own. The duck confit was divine. The skin was super crispy and the meat was tender juicy. It came with creamy potatoes which were just so good. I would go back again, just to try the other dishes. It is only opened for lunch and dinner.","68":"I had been passing by this restaurant since it was set up outdoors at the side of the building some years ago. Finally decided to try the restaurant in its larger fully air-conditioned premises.I was amazed at the food this restaurant churned out, despite my typical \"too salty\" complaint of French food. We had onion and carrot with orange soups. Great except the saltiness :). The Magret de Canard (duck breast) in honey thyme sauce tasted very very good despite the breast a bit too over-cooked in certain portions. Rounded off the meal with the apple tarte which was also fantastic (needed 30mins prep time). Wonderful tasting French food in good proportions. Just ignore the unpretentious setting of plastic plates and cheap plastic table linings. To complete the atmosphere, drinks are served in plastic cups.Definitely coming back again","69":"Great, rustic French food with minimal service but also inexpensive prices. \u00c2\u00a0I was a bit concerned with our friends' recommendation when we walked in due to the minimal, plastic checkerboard tables with ordering at a cashier. \u00c2\u00a0The French silver fox chef with the handlebar mustache in the kitchen gave me a good vibe so we ordered away. \u00c2\u00a0We had a few starters as we were a big group - the escargot, the ravioli, the goat cheese salad and the chicken livers. \u00c2\u00a0All were nice but I especially liked the escargot as it was sauced over a croissant rather than the usual escargot with butter, garlic and parsley in a snail dish. \u00c2\u00a0For mains, we shared two specials - the crab spaghetti ($17) and beef fillet ($29). \u00c2\u00a0Both were quite good and a good slab of perfectly cooked medium rare beef with a small salad and scalloped potatoes at $29 is a great deal for Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The crab spaghetti was small but good with a nice spicy kick. \u00c2\u00a0I wish the wines were a bit better. \u00c2\u00a0We ordered a few bottles as we were a big table and none were great. \u00c2\u00a0This is my only complaint. \u00c2\u00a0We will certainly be back!","70":"Let's just face it - I'm quite the Francophile food-maniac. I've spent weeks stuffing my face with canard and confits and profiteroles and p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9 in the south of France (where the homeliest, yummiest, and most authentic lie), and back when I couldn't afford a plane ticket to Pau or Toulouse, this was the place I went to to get as close to France as I could.I have had the Salmon with Rice and Chicken with Rice & Mushrooms before (can't recall the exact names), and I found myself mmm-ing and ooh-ing and aah-ing at every bite! The cream is tastefully prepared, the specialty mushrooms burst with saut\u00c3\u00a9ed goodness, the meat is always tender and slightly undercooked (sometimes) to preserve the flavour (because that's how they do it!).Prices are on the fun side (just above $10 for a main), the checkered tablecloths are cute and the crockery is pretty basic, in order to keep prices down for our enjoyment, and I feel bad for not coming here often enough. Love it!","71":"If there is a zero, the service here deserves it. I called to try to make a reservation for a big group on Friday and met with an extremely flippant and rude Filipino server. When I asked to make a reservation for a big group of people, he said there's no reservation possible. That's ok. I then asked the capacity to judge how long the wait might be if I have to go since I've never been there and he said 1,000.. I asked how long the wait might be, he said it's busy on weekends and that's why they don't take reservations. I asked what time might be a good time to get there so we don't have to wait, he said 5.30pm. I've called many restaurants before, and this is the worst service I've ever received on the call. If you want to be annoyed for the day, give La Petite Cuisine a call. If not for the fact that my friend really wants to try this restaurant, I will not give it the time of day. Good food is one thing, but rude service cannot rectify for any kind of good food that is being served. There's plenty of other amazing restaurants with great service that deserves to make that money off you!","72":"Have been here quite a few times now and never been disappointed - very good french food at really reasonable prices.My favourite used to be their delicious salmon-stuffed penne in cream sauce, which was one of the cheapest items on their menu, yet one of their most unique. I was thus fairly upset on my latest visit when I found out that they had taken it off their menu.What better to commiserate this loss than with a wonderful plate of foie gras with a sort of orange compote, served with such a generous side of salad. The foie gras was wonderfully pan-fried so it melts in your mouth - so smooth on the inside, while maintaining a thin and crisp membrane to hold the goodness in. The sweet orange compote was the perfect complement - not overwhelmingly sweet, and tangy enough to be unexpectedly tasty. I then had a duck confit canard as my main, because this dish has rarely failed me. It was slightly disappointing this time because the meat didn't peel off as tenderly as I'd expected it too, though the skin was still well crispy. The duck is served with a crispy and creamy potato gratin - so very satisfying I always wipe my plate clean. I've also had the escargot in a croissant before, which was quite an unusual experience as I had always pictured escargots to be in little pots soaked with garlic and oil, so this was quite different, having almost no scent of either. This was therefore rather refreshing, and I really enjoyed it, though maybe the escargot was a little overcooked when I had it.","73":"If they could figure out crowd control so a big group of diners who think they're at the beginning of the line weren't waiting at the cash register, only to be batted back so other diners who had been directed to sit down (after standing in line for 10 minutes) can now stand up to order, this place would be five stars. This ordering circus seemed to have no rhyme or reason, and some of the more chaos-averse would-be diners were visibly exasperated and I think just gave up and left.The food is good and comparatively cheap. We had the dory and the scallops. The scallops were better, but also twice as expensive. The salad and soup were good and really cheap. They only had one of the desserts which were listed on the menu. We went on a Sunday and there was a legitimate French chef, as in a big white guy with a thick French accent, so they get some street cred also.","74":"Moved over a few doors to a bigger space. Not sure if there is an improvement in service - I went on a weekday evening. Food is good and reasonably priced - think no frills French fare. I recommend the escargot with the crossiant, their French onion soup, their chicken liver salad.","75":"Always loved this place, their previous cozy corner location was a better setting, but food is just as good!","76":"Come on Saturday, a friend in the know said, because that's when the French chef cooks. So I've only ever gone on a Saturday, where it is essential to go early or else wait (or split a big party), and it's always been a hoot--the service staff are brisk but will flirt with you when they're less busy, and so will Mr Chef when he's finally done cooking for the night. It's that sort of neighbourhood place. What I like to eat there: chicken liver salad (happiest memory of that trip to Paris), duck confit (perfect if they made it with crispy rather than creamy potatoes!). They also have an Alsatian platter of sausages and sauerkraut, if you want something a bit different. Think of it as French food made accessible through the casual location and the more casual prices.And save room for ice cream at the Island Creamery next door. ;-)","77":"La Petit Cuisine offers very decent French at reasonable prices.We really liked the panfried foie gras with orange confit; generous portion and the orange confit nicely balanced out the richness of the foie gras. Friend raved about the ravioli with prawn and foie gras but I thought it was just OK, while I really liked the duck confit with potato gratin. Casual unpretentious place to have a good meal without breaking the bank.","78":"Real Food has improved for the better!When I lived in Novena many moons ago, I remember avoiding this place during lunch or when I was extremely hungry, because the food would take a long time to come out.I came by during lunch recently and it looks like their kitchen runs a lot more smoothly now- no more long waits!I also enjoyed the grilled veggie tomato pasta that I ordered. The portion was perfect for me and the veggies were grilled perfectly. It was totally worthy of the 'gram! ;)A great spot in Novena for your healthy fix!","79":"Not sure why it took me so long to start visiting Real Food. Perhaps it's the location, as I figured most places in the basement of Square 2 were just \"meh\".I like Real Food because they have a great seating area in the middle of the basement. The tables are communal, and there's even reading material in the form of magazines and used books while you wait (and trust me... you'll be waiting.) There's a lot to choose from on the menu, from all day breakfasts to pasta to juices. Lately, I've been choosing a pasta and some juice as my go-to. I'm a fan of the Spinach Arrabiata with Penne pasta, and I also add in extra garlic for some oomph. Their juices are made to order, and so far I'm loving the Carrot Ginger Pineapple, which aids in digestion.They also have a small store where you can buy oils and other dry foods. At the counter you can also get granola bars and other healthy snacks (I even saw a bag of kale chips- wow!) The only thing I don't like is that the wait for cooked food is a little long; so far I've only come here for dinner and even if it's not busy, I feel like the average wait is about 20 minutes or so. But on the upside, the juices are delivered quickly. Also, an average meal can be a little pricey, almost $20 if you do a juice and pasta, but worth it since it's healthy and in an air conditioned setting!","80":"Very cool very nice very tasty. A bit tough to find. \u00c2\u00a0Nice coffee ans nice bread. Will be back to tru some more. \u00c2\u00a0This time was just a quick stop.","81":"I have been loving this healthy vegan cafe on my week in Singapore for work. It's always good to balance your food indulgences in Singapore with a few healthy options thrown in there.I have tried their classic green salad and also the quinoa patty, both were great, the salad dressing was outstanding, I even asked for the recipe! Their food menu is insanely long; pizza, pasta, stuffed capsicum, salads and so much more. They have a list of juices and coffees, though I found the juices to be very expensive compared to other juice prices in Singapore.There's plenty of seating, even when there is a long line at the counter. I'll be back!","82":"No. Just no.I ordered the vegetable balls spaghetti.The entire dish is hella dry and flavorless.Could use a whole lot more herbs and spices and use fresh tomatoes to retain moisture while adding flavor.I've never imagined how bad spaghetti and marinara sauce can taste, but now I know. My aunt ordered the mushroom pene pasta (with cheese) dry and tasteless too. So disappointed! So expensive too!!! ?!?! I'm better off with microwaved TV dinner food. =.=''Way overpriced, I mean there's a juice bar one step away, it sells fresh juice for $3.50 a 16oz cup, real foods sells juice for $8 and up, for a 8-12oz volume. ?!?!?! Epic fail. 0\/5 if it's an option.Just look at the pictures others posted.(I Should've checked Yelp reviews before dropping in.)","83":"i've been eating here even before i started yelping. i have tried 2 of their other branches (1 at central and 1 at killiney). this is my first time at this branch. \u00c2\u00a0I always make it a point to try something new here and it doesn't disappoint. First, because of the fact that it's healthy. 2nd, they prepare the food just right after you order (so, you have to wait). 3rd, it suits my taste. My favorite so far is their pancake. That's when I realized that eating healthy can be so delicious. Me and friends always order this for sharing. So there, eat healthy y'all. :)","84":"Essentially a place selling vegetarian food in a trendy cafe setting. They have both western and asian favourites which were prepared in a kitchen just away from the main seating area. At the seating area itself, they have shelves and shelves of books for folks to read while enjoying their meals.I found their food quite nice as vegetarian food is not easy to achieve full flavour. I personally won't eat here again unless a treat is given!","85":"First time try Real Food, I ordered the Spanish tomato panne. Honestly, the taste is just OK, costs me $10. I won't recommend this to my friend. There is definitely a reason that the restaurant is quite empty during peak hour.","86":"Pretty good food overall and fast service. Slightly pricey - $7.50 for a small cup of hot cacao, and pretty oily. While the food is decent, it lacks uniqueness; I'd much prefer places like Angel's Bistro, Genesis, or one of the vegetarian restaurants at Fortune Center.","87":"Not a fancy place, but a fantastic workday lunch choice! I've eaten here more than a dozen times over the past months, and this place has never disappointment me. I really enjoy the purist, REAL taste of the food: there's very little use of sauces and spices, so you can enjoy that real taste of the pasta, the omelette, the tomato,... you name it! My favorite is their Spinach Arrabiata Whole Wheat Penne topped with feta cheese.The best thing is that whatever you eat here, you don't feel the post-lunch food coma! The only real drawback is the location: surrounded by a number of other take-away food places, and with no real enclosure, this place feels a little too noisy for a quiet lunch.","88":"This place reminded me a lot of Ruggles Green in Houston. You walk in and they offer a variety of different organic items including kale chips, tortilla chips, nuts, chocolate bars and more for sale at the counter. The menu looks very vegan-friendly, but Paleo folks will still have a limited selection. It's still do-able, though. What lured us in was the brown rice milk ice cream. Yup, it's a cheat - we know...but we so rarely get ice cream and have surprisingly struggled to find coconut ice cream in Singapore...that we caved. Must have been the \"Cave\"man Food we had next door just beforehand. :)We had a fairly substantial wait at the counter - the employee was busy juicing and didn't even bother to turn around to address or greet us until we politely coughed to get his attention. Then he merely told us and another woman that had also walked in to hang on. We finally ordered the dark chocolate to share and it was creamy and just the right consistency. It disappeared quickly! They were also offering strawberry, hazelnut chocolate and a few others. We might have to try out something new if our will power gets the best of us again! :)","89":"I'm staying at the Oasia hotel for a few days and have been enjoying the food here. Their steam dumplings is a must try because one can really taste the freshness. I've been eating here for 2 days straight and they already recognize me when I come in, must be my American personality or maybe I have something on my face. Lol. It's a very calm and friendly eatery, which is a plus.","90":"I was hesitant to eat here because \"healthy\" foods IMO do not taste as good. \u00c2\u00a0But after trying this place, I definitely recommend it. \u00c2\u00a0It had American and Asian (which is rare) food that was healthy. \u00c2\u00a0It's not a fancy place by any means and is a good place to stop by when you need to grab a bite to eat with a friend or friends. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the spaghetti which was decent (a lot of sauce) and miso soup ($7.50). \u00c2\u00a0Strange combination, I know but that's me. \u00c2\u00a0The only con about healthy food places is that it takes a little bit longer to cook but good food for sure.","91":"I generally dislike buffets because I end up stuffing myself to uncomfortable levels to \"get my money's worth\". The food quality is usually lower for the same price point, too - for any given buffet restaurant, I can usually think of an alternative place where I can eat better at the same budget.But Shin Yuu is different. They serve fresh sashimi, delicious sushi rolls and nigiri sushi, grilled meats and tempura. And you'd pay more for the same at most Japanese restaurants like Itacho. Save some space for the sweet potato cone under the tempura section.My only complaint is that the tempura batter for ebi (prawns) could be better.Children friendly, and little ones under 5 eat for free!","92":"Exquisite service by Sarina. Would definitely recommend. The boss man is also very nice guy. Everything was very good. Come come have some fun fun.","93":"Saturday evening, table for 2. Came around 645 and there were only 2 tables occupied and a few people at the counter. About 15 minutes later, the place was packed. Reserve your place in advance- else you'll only get counter seats or outdoor sitting.The dinner buffet is slightly pricy - 60+ after GST and drinks. Dining experience opens with \u00c2\u00a0flambe tuna belly sushi, smoked duck slices, bowl of miso soup and grilled lobster. The lobster was slightly overdone - chewy. The value comes with the endless sashimi. Fresh, thick slices of raw fish. Love the soft shell crab roll. Meat was still warm and very flavourful. As Wesley said, the tempura batter can be improved. It's too heavy and thick.","94":"I am somewhat bewildered as to why Shin Yuu isn't more popular, but then again it's a good thing that it's a well kept secret in the neighborhood so that the restaurant isn't swamped. Shin Yuu is my go-to ala carte buffet place when I'm feeling particularly peckish and hungry. I have never had a bad meal there though I would recommend being firm on what you want and don't want from their list of \"special items\". I don't like cheese gooped on all my food, so I just eat stuff like the smoked duck. Shin Yuu is great because they have an extensive sashimi selection and the fish is decently fresh and served in generous portions. The sushi, both traditional and fusion, are great. They offer some interesting takes on the grilled or stir fried dishes and the fried soft shell crabs are never disappointing. The servers are good about getting your orders in and I've only had 1-2 gone missing in all the visits I've made. Finally the Singaporean owner\/chef is quite personable so if you do get to chat with him he'll crack you up. Shin Yuu to sum up, is a great meal if you're willing to pay for quality (its about $50-60 after service and taxes for dinner), decent service and not have to bother making reservations too far in advance. Plus it's on the Greenwood stretch if you live in the area you don't have to drag yourself downtown.","95":"Fast service and good quality food. The sashimi are fresh, and unlike other buffet places, the service remains fast, \u00c2\u00a0even later in the meal. I usually don't go for buffets because I never eat enough to get my money's worth but here I feel satisfied.","96":"Fast service and great food! A more intimate space compared to larger Japanese restaurants. Only downside: waitress was extremely incompetent in English which made ordering difficult.","97":"Easily one of my preferred \u00c3\u00a0 la carte Japanese buffet restaurants in Singapore. Sure, it is a tad more expensive and the menu may not be as extensive as some other options, but Shin Yuu doesn't scrimp on quality and the food is consistently good. Dinner is more expensive but includes special dishes that are not on the regular menu. When I was there last, our meal started with a platter that included smoked ducked, grilled tuna belly nigiri, and special aburi sushi. The special aburi, in particular, was especially delicious, and that was in the menu so we helped ourselves to more.The service was excellent and prompt. Even though we were the only ones seated outdoors, they made sure to be attentive and empty plates were cleared almost immediately. Four stars because I can foresee myself returning regularly for great Japanese food!","98":"i've been reading books of oldthe legends and the mythsye zi mei and her boobsxin shan ye zi mei baosso big so soft it looksjuicy meat big as fistsand clearly this must rank high up upon a listbut she said, where d'you wanna go?

Nice outdoor seating. No frills, but this is what you're looking for, right? The super big bau was big.","100":"This is a typical handmade dim sum store but dishes out some pretty interesting items. One of their signature dish here is the Ye Zi Mei bao. \u00c2\u00a0Ye Zi Mei Bao is much bigger than a dao pau. (in fact, some says that its about 4 times of a big pau). Its huge, in fact, sometimes we can even share with our friends. \u00c2\u00a0The texture pau can be quite hard especially if you don't eat it freshly steamed but the fillings are good. The meats are tender and flavorful . Even if you are not a fan, you just got to try this once. The other interesting item I have tried at this stall is their century egg siew mai. It adds a interesting taste and texture to the siew mai.","101":"I came here with another Yelper on a Friday night, and there was really no need to make reservations as the place wasn't filled. I got the Irish dry-aged topped with foie gras, which was done perfectly, unlike hers (see Catharina Ip's review for her experience). We also had mushrooms and asparagus sides, which were also done well. They have a good selection of beef here - I like!We did not order dessert, but was given a complimentary one as they had gotten her order wrong. All in all, a good experience for me. I have to say that for the 50% off mains with the Amex Plat card, I feel there is good value there. If I had to pay full price, I don't think I would return.","102":"Let me first say that I find all steakhouses in Singapore expensive but I find Long Bar Steak house just not worth it. I ordered the Omaha Rib-eye with foie gras as extra, bearnaise sauce and asparagus with sun dried tomatoes as a side. First of all, I ordered my steak rare and when it arrived it was everything but rare but I must admit, this was immediately corrected by the staff and they gave us a complimentary dessert so I will not hold that against them.The main reason for rating them 3-stars is that I was very underwhelmed by the food. Don't get me wrong, it was certainly not bad but when I pay close to 200$ a person, I want to be wow-ed and I was not. The steak and foie were (once corrected) executed correctly, the sides were also ok but nothing really extraordinary. The bearnaise was rather disappointing, I do agree that the steak was of decent quality, so it did not really need extra sauce, but I believe if you serve it, you should make sure it is good. Also, the dessert, while free, was nothing special.In addition, I found the staff, while friendly, not very pro-active, I had to ask several times to top up my water glass and in general, it was difficult to waive them down, even though the place was not very busy.Next time I have a craving for steak and saved up some cash, most likely, I will take it somewhere else.  PS: This is another rather disappointing restaurant in the Raffles hotel, I am starting to think that this magnificent hotel has really seen his best days.","103":"Fine dining place with excellent service. They have a sommelier who will give you proper advice on wines based on your budget and taste. Go for the proper marbled beef, leaner cuts are ordinary. You pay for what you get. Coffee and tea is hotel standard, $12.50 for each serving of coffee.","104":"I regularly go to Raffles Hotel for my quick fix of cakes or a quiet read at their courtyard on days that aren't too sunny. But this was my first time at the Long Bar Steakhouse and boy, I was definitely impressed. I had myself a Caesar with smoked salmon for an appetizer, and for a starter, it was huge! I'm not too impressed with it as a whole but, Caesar can't really be elevated much - I did appreciate that they were really generous with the smoked salmon. By the time I finished half my salad, I was quite stuffed! The main was a Filet Mignon, rare. I would've tried blue but I wasn't too confident (nothing to do with LBSH, just many failed attempts at blue from other renowned steakhouses has left me scarred). But, I think even Gordon Ramsay would approve of the colour of the steak. It was nicely salted, I would recommend that if you choose the Steakhouse Butter (think that's the name), you can take it off the top of your steak after a bit. It does add to the flavour but, might make it a tad too salty. And of course, I ordered a foie gras to add to the cut. O.M.G. if you have never had steak and foie gras together in the same mouthful before, you need to try it. At least once. Trust me. Of course they taste just as great when apart - though I would've liked my foie gras slightly more seared, it was perfectly fatty and creamy. I'm a huge fan of fries, but my partner recommended the mash instead - ohmy. it was buttery and creamy - though, I would've loved it to be slightly more creamy, but it was a small thing that doesn't change my liking for it. I wasn't too impressed but the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed spinach, but that's probably cause I like creamed spinach more. (Yes, I think there is a trend, I like creamy stuff.)Dessert, was a tangy lemon tart with raspberry sorbet. It was definitely yummy - I cannot tell you how awesome the little lemon peaks were. The tart was a little too sweet on its own but paired with everything, including the sorbet, the flavours just melt together. OMNOM. Definitely will be back, sometime in the future.","105":"This place is popular and small, make sure you book if you want to be indoors in air-con.The owner couldn't be any more excited about the food on offer and how they make it. He even offered to show us how to make bread if we wanted to visit him one morning! Said bread was perfection, a crunchy seasoned crust and a soft thick centre. We also tried their truffled eggs for an entree which consists of sous-vide eggs on top of pan-fried mushrooms and sausage.For mains we had the Dragon Pasta which was orecchiette with chorizo and mushrooms, and also the Crab Mac and Cheese, which consisted of fresh crab and mushrooms a light creamy sauce on penne pasta.Some interesting ingredient combinations happening at this new restaurant, by a passionate and friendly team. Prices are affordable when compared to other western cuisine outlets in Singapore.Tip: Nets or cash only.","106":"I've never been to the original coffee shop location in Tiong Bahru, but when given the opportunity to try the second (air conditioned!) outlet, I couldn't pass it up.Ah Bong himself was there, manning the cashier and going around talking to patrons. He really cares about his customers!I tried their freshly baked bread, the comfort eggs, and the Flying Dragon pasta (orecchiette and chorizo.) I was definitely a fan of the bread, and the chorizo was plentiful in my pasta and simply buonissimo!This place filled up quick and many tables were reserved. Best to come early or try to make a rez!","107":"It's been eons since I invited friends out for a Peranakan meal. I decided to check out Peranakan Flavours.Chef Ben at Peranakan Flavours did not disappoint. The menu is quite extensive and has some interesting dishes like ox tail buah keluak, chincalok pork, belimbing pork. We had a hard time choosing as everything looks good, and we were hungry. We ended up with ayam buah keluak (the buah keluak is mixed into the gravy which took out the thrill of digging it out \u00c2\u00a0from the shell), beef rendang, black sotong (could do with more squid ink), belimbing pork (the sour flavour is just right), bakwan kepiting (not mini meatballs), chap chye, buah keluak fried rice, hae choe (prawns), kacang botol salad and belimbing pork.The portions come in 1 standard size which is not large, so we could try more dishes.My favourites were buah keluak fried rice, kacang botol salad, belimbing pork, chendol and pulut hitam.Worth another visit to try the ox tail buah keluak and ikan sumbat.","108":"The restaurant opens about 5 months ago.The foods are really good, but the portion is tiny. The chicken rendang was unique in taste. The sambal kankong was not too spicy but delicious. The desert pulot Hitam was the best I ever tasted. Wish it a big larger portion.","109":"Chef Ben is a delight, he has been cooking for 40 years and took great delight in watching us taste his dishes. \u00c2\u00a0Do not miss his Herbal rice with over 40 herbs and spices. \u00c2\u00a0hae Choe (shrimp) \u00c2\u00a0and green leafy veggies. \u00c2\u00a0Wash it down with some homemade lemongrass drink. \u00c2\u00a0$55 well spent","110":"It's all about the black sauce!Riverside Indonesian BBQ was highly recommended by one of the hotel staffs! It's a bit hidden in the Plaza Singapura Mall on the food court level.I came here twice during my visit to Singapore! I ordered their Ayam Panggang (Grilled Chicken Set for SGD5.50), which consisted of grilled chicken thigh with a fried egg over rice and it was covered in this delicious black sauce. I have no clue what's in the sauce (crack? j\/k), but it was certainly addicting. I have to confess that I don't really like plain white rice. I know, shocking that I'm Asian! However, eating the rice with the black sauce, all of my rice vanished! It was like magic!Service is super quick and efficient! Prices here are extremely reasonable! Plenty of seating inside the food court. Be sure to bring napkins or I guess you can just lick off the black sauce! XDI'm ready to go back to Singapore just for this dish alone! :DNearest MRT station: Dhoby Ghaut","111":"This stall is right in the corner of the Plaza Singapura Kopitiam. If you go during the lunch or dinner timings, you won't be able to miss it as this stall would have the longest queue. They have fast service, but be prepared to wait in queue for a while.I always have the grilled chicken thigh on rice. It comes with a salty slice of fried egg and very bland soup. You can opt for an additional serve of boring, undercooked vegetables for 80 cents if you're feeling like you need some greens.The soft and tender chicken has a nice char-grilled flavour, and is dipped in a sweet, black sauce that may have its roots in kecap manis. A watery curry is ladled over the rice, but it's never enough, so I always have to ask for more. I love the mix of sweet and savoury flavours that somehow complement each other, sort of like hainanese scissor cut rice!When I'm feeling really indulgent, I order the set with chicken thigh AND grilled fish or grilled squid. The fish fillet and squid are also grilled, but I find the squid tends to get a bit rubbery and chewy. It does taste fresh, so it's forgivable. The fish is tender, but not fantastic.They have a self service chilli sauce counter, and comes with ikan bilis in it. It's not very spicy, so I often have quite a lot with my meal!","112":"Super tasty steamed rice, with grilled chicken thigh over a gently steamed omelette and sweet spicy chili sauce on the side. At a bargain price of $6, what's not to like? The food court is often crowded so avoid lunch hours, but the food can't be faulted. My fave quick meal in town.","113":"In the entire foodcourt, this stall probably has the longest queue of them all and its easy to see why.The smell of chicken on the grill sort of draws you in and then grabs you by the collar, telling you to get in line and stay there. And what a good decision it is.The chicken thigh is tender and has the distinct smoky chargrill flavour. I ordered mine with the black sauce, and while it can can a little too sweet and syrupy at times, it blends nicely with the chicken. Top it off with a huge dollop of kian bilis sambal and its happy days!","114":"This place has a very simple menu: ayam panggang or barbeque chicken that comes with rice and soup, barbeque fish and 2-3 more combination dishes. It is one of the most popular joints in the food court located on the 6th floor. Chicken was delicious!","115":"Loved this oddly-named vegan eatery! Atmosphere is comfortable, with a calm, cool vibe. Service is friendly and unobtrusive. Menu has detailed information on allergens, and dietary preferences are accommodated. Except for breads, all menu items are gluten-free. (A few contain honey, so be sure to ask if you're a strict vegan.) I had a vegan burger in a gluten-free rice \"bun\". It was full of tasty sauce and toppings, and came with a side of roasted sweet potatoes - a well-rounded, hearty vegan meal. Secure wifi, credit cards accepted.","116":"Don't waste your time or money! The food isn't as fresh or heathy as they portray I really felt deceived by their website & posts. Everything was small & extremely bland. The a\u00c3\u00a7a\u00c3\u00ad isn't even made in house nor the juices. They messed up on our food order & we were told very rudely by Joanna it was our fault. She then said they would still charge us for it. I am a vegan food blogger on social media & have never experienced service like this & deceiving food displays. Horrible","117":"Went here yesterday with a friend and was really impressed by the food. The drinks we had heard weren't worth the price, since everything on the menu was kind of high, but the food was definitely worth it. I split the seasonal special Raw Masala Pizza and the Zucchini with 'Meat' balls and both were delicious- and gluten free!!! There were only three things on the menu that were not gluten free, two of which were burgers, because they made things with Tamari. A must try if you like vegan\/raw food!","118":"My friend and I shared two mains from Today's Specials: Mushroom-Feta Burger and Raw Crispy Lasagne. Both were priced for $22+, which was pretty expensive given the ingredient and portion of food. \u00c2\u00a0The Mushroom-Feta Burger was delicious and filling. It came with a side of sweet potato fries and coleslaw. Normally, I'm not a fan of either of these sides because of their oily, mayonais-y aftertaste but Afterglow's healthy spin made me simply love them! \u00c2\u00a0The main menu offers Raw Lasagne (priced for $20) but the waitress strongly suggested that we try the \"Today's special's: Raw Crispy Lasagne\", which has a extra layer of dehydrated tomato and \u00c2\u00a0Macedonia cheese for the extra crunch. Though the dish was interesting and presented well, the flavor and texture didn't impress me as much as the mushroom-feta burger. Though I liked the substitution of thinly sliced zucchini instead of the actual pasta, it failed to accentuate the tomato sauce flavor. I also was expecting the dish to be warm but it turned out to be cold, and I think I prefer my lasagne warm :PIf I could, I would rate this place a 3.5 for it's delicious burger and ambiance! But sadly the lasagne was a disappointment and the place felt a bit too cozy. \u00c2\u00a0Would I go back there again? I would, just because I would like to give this place another try with their other selections and desserts. Pro:-Romantic setting -Creative dishes-Healthy, raw choicesCons:-Too cozy with little privacy -Expensive-Hard to see the Today's Special's Menu from seating-No wifi","119":"Yay I'm a huge fan for sure! Afterglow is one of its kind. After residing in the west coast for over a year, it is such a great pleasure to dine at a vegan\/raw eatery. The crew is passionate about their food and ingredients. Their motto in serving fresh sustainable dishes keeps their creativity flowing. They are always changing items on the menu. So far, my favourite is the nori achar roll. A local delicacy of pickled vegetable wrapped with sesame and seaweed. I really enjoy the wine selection as well. Brand new to the neighboorhood and already a big hit with the community. Another visit real soon for a more updated review. Keep up the great work guys!","120":"A must must do for vegans--my new favorite place in Singapore. The service is excellent, and the atmosphere welcoming and charming. The coconut latte is not to be missed.","121":"Sometimes a girl just needs a little roughage. A little greenery and something natural as penance for all the booze and late nights. This is where Afterglow comes in, with vegan cuisine served in a chilled environment.I sampled the quinoa salad which was simple and tasty. I would have enjoyed some more variety with the vegetables (there was only lettuce and tomato) but it was healthy and a nice side dish to some shared vegan \"cheese\" with dehydrated vegetable and seed crackers.Ahuh. Vegan cheese. I guess if you squint and pretend that the only cheese you've ever eaten is cream cheese, then this MAY fool you in to thinking it's cheese. In all honestly it's nothing like cheese but it's bloody delicious and I'm pretty sure I ate more than half of my share of what was a shared dish. The crackers it came with were really good smeared with our \"cheese\" made from pinenuts. \u00c2\u00a0This is an absolute must order if you dine here.On a later visit I sat for half an hour, stole the free wifi and drank a coconut water. At $4 for a tiny bottle it seemed very expensive but hey... it was organic and good for me, right?","122":"My sister-in-law is a huge fan here. I think it is still a soft opening right now with only set menu ($16 for lunch). They will start to have full a la carte menu coming Sat 3\/1. Flavors are good and very friendly service.We had cauliflower soup, quinoa soup, rocket salad and a deconstructed sushi bowl. This was a good meal that you won't feel guilty about it afterwards.Slightly on the pricey side (chips with homemade nut cheese cost $19) but considering the quality of the food, quite understandable.","123":"Not cheap but a refreshing retreat from all the fried street food. The concept is raw and vegan. The soups are warm but nothing is heated above 45 degrees C.The restaurant is dark, comfortably air conditioned, with very cool lounge music. Entrees are about 16, not cheap, but you will feel nourished and good about yourself. I treated myself to a blueberry cashew cream parfait. It was light and delicious. For $12 it won't be a regular indulgence but I appreciate the concept of clean eating.","124":"This is the best vegetarian restaurant I have found in Singapore that is not Asian based dishes. \u00c2\u00a0Don't get me wrong, I've had some fabulous meals in Little India, but sometimes you just want to have a larger choice of salads; and salads that don't have tired looking vegetables. \u00c2\u00a0And the deserts! OMG I am not a dessert girl but my dining partner told me that I would be missing out if I did not try, was she right! \u00c2\u00a0All natural, no dairy and purely delicious. \u00c2\u00a0Atmosphere is rustic but comfortable, small so have a reservation! \u00c2\u00a0I'll be back for sure!","125":"I was dragged here by a friend who is gluten and dairy intolerant and I had pretty low expectations. But it was so good! We both loved our meals. I got the avocado mash salad and she got the zucchini linguine. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a delicious, healthy meal!","126":"Very pleasant cute little shop. \u00c2\u00a0I went in and had an Asian salad that was quite good and also a coconut oil coffee that was unique and tasty. \u00c2\u00a0Lots of interesting healthy, raw, organic items on the menu. \u00c2\u00a0Would definitely return!","127":"I'm a fan of this place. It is not the cheapest place to go for a meal, but the food is so healthy and natural, it makes you feel better about yourself. I enjoyed their cold-pressed juice (the green one with spinach in it), it was nice and light and very veggie, with a nice sweetness. The star of the meal was definitely the homemade kimchi nori rolls. These are sushi rice rolls packed with kimchi and chickpeas and god knows what vegetables, but they are irresistable. Super yummy, and tastes healthy at the same time. The soups were good, but nothing to shout about. The nut cheese was interesting, being a cheese made without any dairy, but I thought it was a tad overpriced. The avocado sashimi rice (forbidden rice, avocado, roasted edamame, other vegetables) was very tasty with a hint of sesame oil, but the portion was quite small. The quinoa rice was very bland, don't get it. Will be back for the nori rolls for sure! Good craft beer selection as well, and comfy, relaxed environment.","128":"Back when Whampoa Makan Centre was just known as Whampoa Hawker Centre, Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee was already a popular stall that occupied the corner stall of the middle block in the hawker centre. When the town council decided to renovate the hawker centre, the stall had to make do in a nondescript stall in a temporary hawker centre until the new Whampoa Makan Place was ready, and the stallholders managed to again secure the corner stall of the middle block in the new hawker centre.This commitment to consistency, and perhaps to a lucky spot, translates to their hokkien mee, which has always maintained its standards. I've had it countless times, and it never fails to taste exactly like how it should: gut-strokingly good. They serve a seriously slurpsome plate of hokkien mee that really makes for flavour-packed mouthfuls that will have you scraping your plate when you're reaching the end of your meal. Don't refuse the sambal when they ask. Mix it, the pork lard and the noodles all up with a squeeze of lime and you end up with a savoury mixture with sotong and prawns that you scoop up with your spoon more than you pick up with your chopsticks. This is a hokkien mee that will make you want to lick your plate clean.Don't try to order at the front of the stall. You do this at the side of the stall where the server is perched on a stool, ready to point at you to get your order. And don't be put off by the inevitable queue. It moves fast as they cook their noodles in large batches. They used to bring the food to your table years ago but now they're so popular that they can't afford to that anymore. The stall only advertises hokkien mee, but they also do a secret dish: a chinese mee goreng that is also really, really good. But there's a price to pay if you choose to order it. You have to wait a little longer because it means the cook will have to take a break from cooking hokkien mee to specially cook your order of mee goreng. This means the people in the long queue behind you will have to wait longer too. So, order wisely.","129":"Noodles tasted divine. Very simple, yet perfectly balanced and not too salty. Unlike other wet versions, this one stays rather dry yet imbued with delicious notes of its underlying prawn broth that awakens tastebuds. The sambal chilli paste on the side has a lovely orangy-red color and brings another dimension to the dish together with a squeeze of lime. There is usually a line that moves quickly thanks to a well organized system of taking\/fulfilling orders.","130":"You know if there's a food court with tons of stalls and there's a line at one that's it's gotta be good. Came here cause it was recommended by my aunt and it's become a new favorite! The prawn hokkien mee is exactly what I expect. The right flavor profile in the\"gravy\", the balance of the two different noodles, the plentiful shrimp, and the chili. It is a plate of home!","131":"Legendary hawker doing their thing.Consistency. Every time I eat it taste the same. They got their formula right.","132":"Being one of my favourite local dishes, I must say that I've eaten countless dishes of hokkien mee throughout my youth and have tried numerous stalls across Singapore. This, however, remains one of my absolute favourites, and I dare say that it's probably one of the best hokkien mee stalls in Singapore. Kind of a soggy seafood noodle dish, the best way to enjoy hokkien mee is to squeeze lime over the dish and mix in a generously dollop of sambal. The sambal here is especially delicious, and really sets this hokkien mee apart from others. Whilst most of the stalls at Whampoa stay open throughout the day, Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee and another hokkien mee stall just across from it tend to close on weekday mid-afternoons, opening mainly for lunch and dinner.","133":"Loved the Kama! \u00c2\u00a0Sushi was superb. \u00c2\u00a0Was not a long wait. \u00c2\u00a0Location is not ideal- in a mall. \u00c2\u00a0But judging by the line that formed after we got there, clearly a fan favorite. \u00c2\u00a0. Great options for sushi but you need to try the Kama (yellow tail collar) soooo good!","134":"A few things about Shinji, simplified:1) Shinji is not even close to a michelin star Ginza restaurant. This is important, as other diners made ridiculous requests, such as :Wasabi in soysauce, ginger in soysauce, SPICY MAYO, LESS RICE.What the heck?2) Based off point 1, don't come in here expecting a ginza experience. The itamaes won't deliver that based off the audience that dines. That being said, the atmosphere is much more fun and relaxed then high end sushi-ya.3) The sushi is good, flown in fresh from Japan. Because of the travel involved, it does command a higher price then Tokyo. They actually have someone pick out the fish from the fish market then send it off to Singapore, very neat.4) I did get to try some really good sushi that you won't see at Ginza restaurants. So all in all, its expensive with a nice variety of fish, but not a great experience.","135":"Came here for the $125 sushi set for a special occasion on a Saturday lunch about a year ago. Service was incredible, with the chef explaining what he was serving with its Japanese names (and English names upon request). The sushi was fresh, and the uni especially was delicious. A server unobtrusively monitored and changed our cup of green tea every time it stopped steaming! The restaurant owner even stopped by to make conversation with us. The husband, who is an edomae sushi fan, left beaming.","136":"For me, the most amazing 2.5 hours spent in Singapore was at Shinji by Kanesaka. I enjoyed it even more than the crazy shopping scene there. And just for Shinji, I'm willing to go back, tough out the crazy heat\/humidity and giant mosquito bites just to eat here again.Shinji is located inside the St. Regis hotel on Tanglin Road. Its fa\u00c3\u00a7ade is clean, simple, unassuming, yet extremely elegant--very typical Japanese d\u00c3\u00a9cor. When you walk in, a bevy of beautiful Japanese waitresses dressed in kimonos greet you and show you to your seat. This is a small restaurant with about 14-16 seats at the counter, and one standalone table for 2 so chances are you will be seating at the counter so you can chat with the sushi chefs.Shinji has a small menu with 3-set courses: Tsuki (a 12-piece set - $125 Sing), Yuki (a 14-piece set - $185 Sing) and Yume (omakase special w\/ about 14-16 pieces\/dishes - $250 Sing). I of course had the Yume because I am a piggy. Also, keep in mind there will be several additional surcharges tacked onto your bill. Singapore charges a premium when it comes to fine dinning. For 2 people with 2 omakase and non-alcoholic drinks, we paid around $800 Sing so don't be shocked when you see all the surcharges. Also, there is a 10% service charge so tipping is optional. However at this kind of establishments and their impeccable level of service, these waitresses really do deserve an additional tip so don't be one of those stingy Asians!Since the menu changes frequently, there's no point for me to rate each of the dishes I had. Just trust the chefs that whatever you eat there is sure to be amazing.","137":"The chef forgot about me towards the end of my omakase when other patrons started being seated and I constantly had to flag down a waitress to fill my tea and to also pour my expensive Shinji-branded sake into our carafe (since there is nowhere on the counter that they could put it, they had it next to them). I don't think the waitresses were Japanese either, they sounded Singaporean which doesn't feel as authentic unfortunately unlike other top spots in the city.I hate giving bad reviews to places that give a lot of joy to a lot of people but this was my second straight disappointing and frustrating experience at a Shinji property. You're spending a lot of money to have that perfect omakase experience from beginning to end and personally, I did not. Some pieces of sushi were even fishy tasting to me and the cooked stuff as a whole was just okay. It's a chain to me these days and I'm truly not a fan of Japanese restaurants where the head chef is rarely there to put his heart, passion and artistry into each course for you. You spend this kind of money for their own personal craft and although some 3 Michelin Star sushi restaurants around the world do this too (Masa in NYC comes to mind), the chef is almost always actually there. To each their own, however, and I understand Shinji probably has the grandest name for sushi in Singapore so definitely check it out if you are omakase hopping around Singapore as much as I do.The good - the restaurant space in the St. Regis is absolutely beautiful. One of my favorites of any restaurant.","138":"Best sushi place in Singapore. Chef Kikuchi-San is amazing and I always ask for him whenever I dine here.","139":"Solidly good tapas, but missing a little kick. Can recommend the staples like garlic prawns, croquettes and churros. Beer and wine pretty good too, and very reasonably priced. Service a little touch and go. Overall, good for a casual date.","140":"Tool almost all their signature tapas and they were all good. \u00c2\u00a0Only issue was that the food came out all at once so we had to rush to eat so it won't be cold. \u00c2\u00a0Only the coffee was not great could tell it was a standard auto machine made. Otherwise service was efficient.","141":"Food very average. My chicken was hard and dry and pretty tasteless. The croquettes were not bad. The view and ambience nice if not too Spanish. No need to return.","142":"3 stars but I will try it again. The place was full and very busy for dinner. Service was excellent. Kitchen was quick to deliver. What gives three stars is that some of the food was good, some OK, some bad. The jamon croquets: avoid the jamon, the croquets themselves were fine. The small amount of jamon served with this dish seemed spoiled - glad we did not order the larger more expensive portion of jamon.Grilled vegetables were very good.Garlic prawns had good flavor but were a bit soft - not very fresh.Eggplant chips with honey was like a desert - the honey was too sweet and seemed out of place. Still it was edible.Padrino peppers were very good. Its hard to mess these up though.The creme brulee with sorbet was not so good. The (raspberry?)sorbet was not a good match with creme brulee, and the creme brulee was bland and a bit grainy - it is supposed to be smooth and creamy. The burned sugar was a bit over burned.We will give it one more shot and avoid the dishes we didn't like, maybe try some new ones.","143":"Outstanding food. Caters to vegetarians too. We had the spinach croquettes that were tender and delicious; the batatas and paella were super.","144":"New to the restaurant scene, Tapas Club is one of the best Spanish eateries I've tried in Singapore. We ordered a cold cut platter, mushroom croquette (highly recommended!), grilled garlic prawns, grilled sea bass (recommended, again), a steak, vegetable paella, and some wonderful churros! Tapas portions were great. The only issue we faced for the night was that our vegetable paella came out slightly burned with quite a pungent taste. Our waiter and the restaurant supervisor handled the situation very professionally by changing the paella to the seafood style immediately and putting the churros on the house! Great service, fantastic food, and good draft beers!","145":"Great restaurant with a variety of chicken rice, wraps, and coffee. \u00c2\u00a0My wife and I tried the imperial chicken with brown chicken rice and they were both really good. \u00c2\u00a0The veggie wrap was pretty good but I would ask for less mayo for myself while my wife said it was good. \u00c2\u00a0I tried three different kinds of coffees from here. \u00c2\u00a0One of them was a bit sweet for me but the other two were really good. \u00c2\u00a0 While there were other coffee shops around I highly recommend the different types of coffee here. \u00c2\u00a0The thirteen types of coffees are named after the 13 states in Malaysia, check with the cashier to see how sweet each one is so you can adjust the sweetness accordingly. \u00c2\u00a0Overall the food was pretty good, it's a modern twist on some traditional Singaporean food. \u00c2\u00a0They just recently expanded the location so there's a lot of seats. \u00c2\u00a0They just opened a few months ago so I think there's some room to improve the layout of their menu to make it easier to order the main dishes, appetizers, and drinks. \u00c2\u00a0The place is clean and spacious plus the staff were very friendly. \u00c2\u00a0I'm looking forward to coming back again and try out other things on the menu.","146":"If you happen to be in the area, do pop by this place for a quick snack. Made on the spot, fresh and simply delicious. The earlier two reviews are still relevant and accurate, hence I shan't repeat whatever they said (:Just think of crispy pancake with meat and oyster, with a dash of silverbait and nuts. Too bad it's at Jalan Besar and I live in the West D:","147":"They serve only one thing - Fuzhou style oyster cake, and they do it well. The standard option is $1.80, or $2.30 for additional filling, which I think is mainly one more oyster.This is a traditional Fuzhou snack, and a rare find in Singapore these days. A shallow metal ladle is first coated with batter, then a whole shrimp, some pork mince, an oyster, and chopped chives are carefully place on the middle before another layer of batter is carefully ladled over. A sprinkle of peanuts and baby fish (ikan bilis) and the ladle is lowered into a wok of oil for deep frying. So yes, these are painstakingly hand made, no short cuts. They also do customized orders, someone ahead of me requested one with no oysters no chives.I had to wait about 10mins for my order, and it was fantastic. Perfectly fried and crispy, did not taste oily at all. The batter was just enough to enrobe the filling, but not so much as to be doughy and distracting. They probably deserve 5*, but this was just a first visit so I reserve final judgement.They used to be in a coffee shop across the road on Sam Leong Road, and now are located at the Berseh Food Centre.","148":"Delicious oyster cakes. The main reason why it is tasty is because it isn't bland, is on the salty side, and has lots of ingredients within. Meat, oysters, and some aromatics. While it is deep-fried, it doesn't feel that oily, for some reason. The cloying oil smell I associated with deep-fried stuff isn't there. While I'm not sure these oyster cakes can keep as I finished mine immediately after buying it, I'm sure they would be great to take home and nom.","149":"Credit Card: YesThis place is located in the plaza. It's a more expensive restaurant than the food courts but the sashimi is very good and fresh here. I happened to pop over here while explore the plaza next to the hotel. The staff was very kind, I ordered a chirashi take take-away which came out to be $26 (SGD) - it was so delicious and the portions were very decent. I may come again before I leave!","150":"Great value for money in this well-hidden place. Really good variety of food, I typically have sashimi by the slice or the wagyu teppanyaki. Warm and friendly service - ask the chef and he'll recommend whatever's freshest. Seems to be a favourite among Japanese businessmen here, always a good sign!","151":"Never knew this place existed! It's well hidden in a place people seldom go or walk past! A friend of mine walked passed it a few weeks back and we decided to give it a go. Anyways this review is strictly about their teppanyaki menu only as we did not try anything else!I've been on the search to find reasonably priced but GOOD teppanyaki for the longest time.Anyways we went there on a Sunday evening at around 6-7pm. There isn't that many people. They do sell other types of Japanese food like Sushi, Sashimi, Chirashi etc.. but I was craving Teppanyaki so we decided to go for the Sets.The teppanyaki comes either as alacarte or sets. They have a few sets to choose from like Wagyu Beef Set, Normal Beef, Chicken, Seafood & if im not wrong, lobster. I decided to try the Chicken since i was feeling a bit sick of beef at the moment. My friend however did order the beef and I tried it. The beef was well cooked and really soft! The sets come with miso soup, salmon, veg, rice and desserts like ice cream.From experience, many Teppanyaki places Ive been to normally have almost all the food taste really similar coz they seem to use the same sauce for everything! This was not the case down here. It had a kind of a bit more \"homely\" taste. It costs about 60 - 80bucks per person for the teppanyaki sets, depending on which one you go for.I still don't think it's really worth the price coz the food was so-so. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't that good either. For $70 a head... I'm definitely not looking for so-so.","152":"Yamagawa is a hidden gem Japanese restaurant at Furniture Mall.I was brought to this restaurant by my Japanese colleague. You can either choose to go for their ala carte menu or their buffet menu. I would recommend people to go for their buffet menu unless you want to try their Teppanyaki.Their customers are usually made up of families and regulars. As few would know the existence of the restaurant, until someone bring you here.First, I would like to comment on their hand roll. Please go for California hand roll. It is my top favourite food in the restaurant. Crispy seaweed wrap around the fresh crabmeat. You can even hear the crack of the seaweed when you eat it. It is also a must to try their sashimi, really fresh and smooth. Their Yamagawa salad is really popular as well.","153":"Value for money. Wide variety of food from traditional sushi to teppanyaki. Ask the chef to recommend. \u00c2\u00a0He will steer you to the freshest available. Staff are friendly and the service is warm. Definitely recommended.","154":"We had the most beautiful time and food here. Still dreaming about the perfectly prepared cod, the delicious shrimp, flounder....I could go on and on. We were given VIP treatment and loved every bite...","155":"This place has some of the best fried Hokkien Mee in Sg IMHO. It easily competes with the lorong 29 mee.It comes with very generous serving of prawns and the excellent chilli sauce compliments the dish very well.The coup de grace is the fried pork lard which I know I shouldn't partake in but due to my weakness, just cannot resist....it makes the dish even better! Parking can be hard to find given that it is facing a busy street corner but we somehow always manage to get a spot.","156":"Great food and experience. Came here for an anniversary dinner, and it's one of our favorite date spots. FOOD (they can flat out cook):* menu changes 2 or 3 times a year* must try: steak, uni toast, grilled romaine, paella SERVICE:* just the right amount of attentive* if you sit at the counter, then cooks interact with you as well* gave us an anniversary cakePRICE: * $$$$ (350 for 2 pax)* we did order quite a few dishes, and a bottle of wineOVERALL: * don't go too hungry...portions are small and dishes expensive* definitely sit at the counter* great experience...would go again","157":"The food is good and the plating is polished, but for these prices, we should be able to expect better service, privacy and ambiance too. Nice if you'r with some local friends, but I would not recommend it to my well-traveled friends with more discerning tastes.","158":"I've eaten at wonderful restaurants all over the world, and this spot is one of my favorites. Although they can accommodate larger groups, you get the best experience with a small group seated at the bar. Everyone is friendly and accommodating, and the vibe is more neighborhood bar than fine dining. Oysters, prawns, cauliflower, paella and desserts are all amazing and beautifully presented.","159":"Fun place for a night out, plus the dishes are creative, novel and exciting.We had:- Mini Spanish breakfast: soft scrambled egg, mushroom and chorizo ketchup, baked potato foam ($10) - delicately served in a wooden box and on a bed of hay. The potato foam and the egg went deliciously well together, and was light on the palate, with the chorizo ketchup giving a nice homely aftertaste.- Esquina's Spanish omelette: confit onion, potato, crispy bread, olive oil caviar ($6) - this was alright, tasted more like lightly fried potato than anything.- Roasted cauliflower, cauliflower couscous, Serrano ham, manchego cheese ($16) - this was decent and flavorful; a tad too much oil though- Crispy baby squid, chili coriander, squid ink aioli ($14) - we ordered this at the spur of the moment, and it turned out to be one of our favorite dishes of the night. The squid was crispy and flavorful, and we loved the squid ink aioli. Perfect for munching over great conversation. Definitely get this to share.- Pigeon, forest berries escabeche, burnt Rosemary polenta, crisp shallots ($22) - this took forever to come, though the pigeon was juicy and tender. The berries were a nice touch. - Grilled Spanish octopus, Jerusalem artichoke, burnt onion, oyster leaf ($28) - the best dish of the night, in my books. The octopus was meaty and tender, loved the charred bits, and it went brilliantly with the artichoke puree. Highly recommend this.- Salted cod \"Alkorta\", iberico & tomato chickpeas, black garlic from \"Las Pedroneras\" ($28) - another brilliantly executed dish. The chickpeas and tender cod went fantastically with the sweetness of the black garlic, not to mention the visually stunning presentation. We were too full for dessert, but they did give us complimentary bites of chocolate ganache on bread.I liked that the chef made the effort to serve the dishes (we were seated at the bar) and introduce the dishes to us. However, the service was slightly off. The servers had a knack of interrupting us mid-conversation\/mid-bite. Got slightly annoying after awhile. Overall enjoyable and worth a visit!","160":"I have been to Esquina several times and I was initially a huge fan but I must say that it has really become worse. The Singapore outpost of Jason Athertons restaurant empire is not at all up to the level that one should be able to expect. The dishes are some sort of mid-sized dishes categorized by Sea, \u00c2\u00a0Land and Soil. Much of the food is of very good quality, especially the Spanish Breakfast and the mini pork burgers standout. The food is however not the main problem, it is more the service that is faltering. We were just seated when we were told it is last orders. Why even accept reservations if you are closing the kitchen right away? The service was also in general slow, \u00c2\u00a020 minutes wait for a beer when the place is virtually empty isn't ok. Staff were also mostly interested in talking on the phone or with each other. We also had them without asking opening bottles of water and charging 9.5++ SGD per bottle. Selection of beer is boring and over-priced but the wine selection is good and can recommend the Torello cava. The prices per glass are however cheaper than buying a bottle (they claim 5 glasses per bottle and the price for a bottle is 6.9 times the glass price - \u00c2\u00a0waitress just stared at me and left when I pointed out it was cheaper to buy per glass. Probably not her fault but the management need to have better pricing strategy). This all sounds like the place is bad but the redeeming feature is the food so hope the management can produce some decent service as the prices should mean that one can expect both food and service to be good.","161":"Great food\/menu, entertaining atmosphere, attentive staff.Went for dinner on a Friday night and was very impressed. Sat at the bar, on the other side of which is the kitchen with the chef and his staff flying around carefully preparing each dish. Several times I saw the chef inspect food made by his staff, determine it wasn't quite right and have them do it again. Although I'm sure it was still good, I appreciated the dedication to only serving perfect food. The staff was also very good - very attentive, reminded you of the specifics of the dish when serving, and generally accommodating. Specifics below, but recommend ordering the Cauliflower and Pigeon and sit at the bar. The paella looked incredible - watched them make at least a dozen.Food:Chorizo Iberico Croquettes: really really good, could eat them until I was sickShishito Peppers - came in some chimichuri \/ sriracha sauce which was terrific - was a daily specialRoasted Cauliflower - really really good. Combination of the char from roasting the cauliflower with the couscous and the creamy sauce is a home run.Grilled Octopus - good, but in comparison to the other dishes, lacked flavorRibeye - great flavor, perfectly cookedPigeon - must order - cooked to perfect,very flavorful, could eat several orders of this","162":"Believe it or not, my husband and I were able to immediately get a table at Esquina at 8 PM on a Friday WITHOUT reservations.* I have a sneaking suspicion that this only happened because Potato Head Folk recently opened and the crowd moved there for the next few weeks. Maybe walk-ins at Esquina will be possible until the hype dies down?Since I wasn't able to check out the interior, this review will strictly be about the food. As the dishes are tapas portioned, our server recommended that we order about 7 dishes between the 2 of us. Luckily, I wasn't too hungry that evening, so we were able to get away with just 5 (which definitely put our wallet at ease in the end.)I ordered 2 snacks. The warm thyme and onion bread was more like a typical butter croissant to me. I couldn't taste any of the thyme and onion. I did like the smoked bone marrow butter it came with, though- it was served in the bone, which was cool, and it had a distinct taste (in a good way.) My second snack was the pork crackling, which I loved. The dish is comprised of 2 big pieces of pork crackling, decorated with salt cod and smoked herring roe. It was creative and I'd order it again.For my main, I chose the \"soil\" category (basically, veggie based dishes.) I really enjoyed my beet salad. The burrata they used was what won me over. Hell, it also won Miguel over, and he doesn't even like beets! The raspberry and pinenut crumble was a nice touch and went well with the rest of the flavours. However, the truffle honey was a bit of a miss for me; Migs said he could smell it but I felt that it was lost amongst everything else that was going on.Despite the creative dishes, some of the flavours just don't come through. Considering the prices, I expect more. But I get the trendiness of it all, and it's definitely a place to be seen. I wouldn't come here if I were super hungry, but for drinks with friends or a light dinner, I'd be cool with it.--*Well, we did end up with a tiny table outside, which isn't ideal, but a table is a table! And yes, for the longest time, they didn't accept reservations, but now they do! Make your life a ton easier by booking an inside table through Chope. ;)","163":"Initially thought we were going to sit on the 2nd floor but happy we were seated along the kitchen bar. \u00c2\u00a0The Head Chef from Barcelona was extremely pleasant to chat with and definitely made our experience memorable. Highly recommend grabbing a bite here and sparking up conversation with the kitchen staff- you won't regret it! Tapas were top notch and every dish was delicious! If we are ever in Singapore again we will be stopping by again!","164":"This is a review of a dinner at Esquina. \u00c2\u00a0This was a dinner with my manager. \u00c2\u00a0He selected the restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0It is one of his favourites.tinyurl.com\/aap4gfnThis was one of my favourite meals in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0This was primarily due to the quality of the food and the general energy of the other patrons enjoying their meals.The ambiance is a bit cramped. \u00c2\u00a0But there is such a great energy from watching the food being prepared, taken out, and then quickly devoured by appreciative diners. \u00c2\u00a0Most of the seating is along the bar. \u00c2\u00a0There is some minimal outdoor seating. \u00c2\u00a0I am not sure why they went with tractor seats for the bar stools. \u00c2\u00a0They are not as painful as I thought they would be. \u00c2\u00a0But they seem to be a needless form over function design decision. \u00c2\u00a0There is a certain eclectic appeal to the decor.tinyurl.com\/bcupdhrtinyurl.com\/bjkjlolThe service was quite good. \u00c2\u00a0Our server was very informative. \u00c2\u00a0She checked often to see if things were moving along. \u00c2\u00a0The food came out in a very orderly fashion.The food ranged from good to exceptional. \u00c2\u00a0For me, the modern culinary movement is greatly about reinterpreting foods and cuisines with the best ingredients possible. \u00c2\u00a0I think Esquina is doing that with tapas. \u00c2\u00a0They are taking the form of small shareable plates and casting aside the traditional versions. \u00c2\u00a0They are focusing on delivering excellent flavours created from quality ingredients to the plate without regard to whether it is a customary dish.Sea Urchin Bisque - This may be the best sea urchin dish I've ever eaten. \u00c2\u00a0i tend to eat sea urchin alone. \u00c2\u00a0But seeing it used as a component brought it to a completely different level.tinyurl.com\/b465fjbBeetroot Salad - This was a very unique salad. \u00c2\u00a0it blended flavours and textures very well.tinyurl.com\/aqh8zf9Sea Bass - This was a very well prepared piece of fish. \u00c2\u00a0It was perfectly cooked and simply allowed the taste of the fresh fish shine through.tinyurl.com\/axa2nm4Chicken Wings in a foam - The chicken was so tender and flavourful. \u00c2\u00a0The foam added just a touch of sweetness. It really came together well.tinyurl.com\/bxpp6gkPork Cheeks - This was, to me, the weakest dish. \u00c2\u00a0I know. \u00c2\u00a0It is pork. \u00c2\u00a0How can I say that about pork. \u00c2\u00a0I just thought it was a touch dry. \u00c2\u00a0The flavour was great. \u00c2\u00a0The texture just didn't seem quite right.(no photo)Curry with lobster - This was a beautiful dish. \u00c2\u00a0The curry was nice. At some level though, I thought the curry overpowered the sweetness of the lobster. \u00c2\u00a0I think the dish could just as easily been made with a nice prawn. \u00c2\u00a0Lobster is a delicate sweet taste. \u00c2\u00a0it is easily lost.tinyurl.com\/bea95ouThis meal was compliments of my manager. \u00c2\u00a0However, I do want to note that I think this is a dining experience worthy of the associated price. Overall - This stands within the five best meals i've enjoyed in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The food is the star of the show. \u00c2\u00a0But certainly the energetic ambiance provides a strong supporting role. \u00c2\u00a0The service was also very good. \u00c2\u00a0Esquina is the type of dining experience I look forward to sharing with others.(lol - i do not usually mention other reviews. \u00c2\u00a0however, according to one of the other reviews, i must be pretentious if i like esquina. \u00c2\u00a0i just want to say if that is the cost for enjoying this wonderful dining experience, so be it. \u00c2\u00a0i will be as pretentious as it takes.)","165":"I really dig the shophouse feel. We dined on the second floor which felt like a private dining room. Our food was above average, but the service quality was below. It's a decent place for tapas and an OK wine list. I waiting for 20 min to get my beer after I ordered though. If Binomio is booked out down the road, this should be your next choice for tapas in the area.","166":"We made a reservation for two at 7pm inside, and were seated at the far end of the table where one seat wasn't really a seat but never mind.We asked the waitress how many plates should two people have and she answered three. Well three is a wrong number as we ended up ordering more and waiting and waiting because we didn't order at a go. How inefficient.We had the seaweed dashi poached oyster, which was okay, tasted like a boiled oyster with some dashi, nothing really special. I am not pleased to announce we were not impressed with the pork crackling as it tasted like pork flavored fried fish maw with some black roe on top. None of the lardy goodness we were expecting. We mostly got plates from the Sea section, the scallop sashimi with duck ham, lemon, and burnt cucumber was okay. Scallop sashimi has a delicate flavor and I felt the accompaniments overwhelmed it. Good accompaniments should accentuate the flavor instead. I did like that they left the scallops whole instead of slicing them thin or into pieces.Next up was the seared scallops with duck green curry and coconut rice. I don't eat peanuts so we got them on the side so that's good. The scallops were really good and seared properly but again the green curry didn't complement the scallops!We were hungry so we got the snapper, which was done quite well and came with pine nuts and couscous, with some orange. This went quite well as a dish and I rather enjoyed it. Last up for savories was the beef short ribs with cauliflower, tongue, and brown butter. This was a disappointment because we waited the longest for this and it tasted very ordinary. Well it just wasn't a party in my mouth. Meh. We ended the meal with desserts and had the chocolate mousse with popcorn milk and the manchego cheese pudding. We thought the popcorn milk sounded good on paper but it overwhelmed the mousse and textures wise, mousse and milk don't quite go well together.The cheese pudding was a welcome surprise as it was salty and sweet with the apricot jam that came with it. I liked it.Would I come here again? Probably not. This place is pricey, has soso service, and flavor combinations don't pair very well. I would go out on a limb and say this - the chef in charge of the menu is ballsy but doesn't have an amazing flavor palette. By tasting the food I think their cooking skills are up there, with excellent technique, but the menu is just a disappointment. There is innovative cuisine, and there is food mixed up on a platter. Every bite is a surprise, but not necessarily a good surprise.","167":"Popped in for lunch, very interesting setting and usage of narrow and long space by setting up bar seats and the chefs prepare the food right in front of you. \u00c2\u00a0Chef Matthew is Spanish and is meticulous at crafting the dishes. \u00c2\u00a0The layering of flavors, textures of ingredients is extremely creative and ingredients themselves are unique and fresh. \u00c2\u00a0Chef Matthew is very creative, the basel and red pepper sorbets are awesome, so as the onion jam, fermented garlic paste, emulsified fish in the nigiri and the many other fantastic creations. The beauty is in using old school techniques and classic Spanish ingredients but presenting them in a new forms. \u00c2\u00a0Impressive stuff.","168":"The four of us came here on a Saturday night. We tried to make reservation but they only do it for people dining at their \"supper club\" which serves pre-fixed menu only (around $95 I think). Knowing this is a popular spot we arrived pretty early at 6:30pm, and there was one, yes only one, outdoor table left for us.The food was decent. We loved the babe squid appetizer with squid ink aioli. For entr\u00c3\u00a9e our favorites were smoked mackerel and beef wellington. Also worth mentioning was the Tiramisu - a deconstructed\/gastronomic version.However, the service was sub par. All the waitresses were nice but they just weren't around very much. It took us forever to get drinks, get our plates changed etc. Definitely feel like they were understaffed.","169":"The good: \u00c2\u00a0Although close quarters, I like the design\/space. \u00c2\u00a0Open kitchen concept always calls for some dining entertainment. \u00c2\u00a0Very unique vibe; felt like the crowd were regulars and everyone seemed happy to be there. \u00c2\u00a0The bad: \u00c2\u00a0Let's not beat a dead horse here, but there are some obvious areas for improvement. \u00c2\u00a0The service could be better, the cost could be lower, the portions could be bigger, the food could be tastier and the seats could be more comfortable. \u00c2\u00a0Aside from that though, it's great! The ugly: \u00c2\u00a0I really don't understand how people RAVE about this place. \u00c2\u00a0My only conclusion is that they are rich blokes with a high tolerance for butt pain (get your mind out of the gutter), astronomical bills and possess highly damaged taste buds. \u00c2\u00a0With a few other good tapas options out there unless you are personal friends with the chef\/owner and\/or a cowboy, there isn't a good reason to go.","170":"It feels like they took quite a risk with the place - long and narrow, the indoor space can only afford to have an open kitchen and a single, overcrowded bar counter. But it somehow works, and it's constantly busy with customers returning for food which more than makes up for the slight discomforts. They have a few additional tables outdoors, but the ambience is definitely different from the flurry of activity taking place inside. We arrived after 7 on a Monday, and the indoor seats were already taken up. Nevertheless, the food was awesome, and we loved the clean, fresh flavours of the scallop cerviche. The Iberico Pork and Foie Gras Burger is delicious as well, but the foie gras flavours and textures weren't really present. The desserts - oh, the desserts - embody exciting flavours, and it was really difficult to make that final decision. A great place for tapas, that's for sure. Each dish in the meat and seafood categories will set you back at least SGD 20, but they're worth every penny.","171":"Intimate and friendly dining experience. Great food menu. The wine list was very disappointing. Prices are outrageous . Only 3 reds to choose from and 1 of them was out of stock. Let's think of improving the choice for the diner please.","172":"The wait can be excruciating given how tiny the place is. But I love the space, love the energy, love the service, love the food!!Our server told us that it was an exceptionally crowded for a Thu. We started by sitting outdoors getting our drinks while waiting for a table. The wait was 1.5 hours by the time we got a seat inside. While outdoors, we started with some crispy baby squids with our sangrias. The sangria is yummy! And the crispy squid lightly battered and served with squid ink aioli. Do not expect our local version of crispy squid, Esquina does it with the squid still soft and juicy inside, while only the exterior is crispy. Dishes:- sea urchin and crab bisque. Like what Mark D. said, absolutely wonderful. The sweetness of the urchin is perfect and it is served with clunky crab meat. It is also served beautifully plated on a stone bowl.- ham croquetas. Filled with chunky iberico jamon, wonderfully salty and balanced with the potato filling. - marinated beet salad. It is too difficult to get good beets in Singapore. I never liked beet until I moved to NYC, and eating beets there totally changed my mind about this muddy veggie. The version here is still not like the beets we get in NYC, but the execution of the dish is faultless. It is served with burrata cheese and honeycomb. The honeycomb gave an amazing finish to the entire dish that it gave me pure joy....- beef tatare with frozen foie gras and confit egg yolk. This is served in small portions served with toast. We were not sure on what to expect when we read frozen foie gras. But when it was served, I knew it was exactly like the shaven foie gras p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9 dish that I had in David Chang's momofuku ko restaurant where he served it up like a bowl of savory ice-cream. Totally yummy, and I only wish they are more generous with the shavings here. Complex flavors, beautifully executed.- seafood paella. Do not expect the traditional Spanish paella. This doesn't come with the soccarat (crispy bottom bits). It is closer to a rendition of risotto without the cheese, so it is much lighter and you can really taste the seafood bisque that they use to cook the rice. The seafood is served on the side and you get snapper, shrimp and crispy squid. I didn't feel that I need the seafood at all, quite happy with just the paella.Overall, really enjoyed the dinner. The tiny space reminds me so much of the little restaurants that peppered the village in Manhattan. It was a blessing in disguise that Burnt Ends was full till 9.30pm, which is why we ended up here. I was not impressed with Jason atherton's other restaurants in Sg, this one now totally changed my mind. Now....if only the wait is shorter!","173":"I've been here 4 times and tried 30+ dishes (via foodmento app). Small innovative eats is one of my favorites foods. I would come here again sooner, but I think back to the damage the last 4 times...Dishes I LOVED: - salt & pepper squid- roasted pedron pepper- iberico pork & foie burger- sevllle orange & rosemary ice cream- roast duck, truffle honey...(special)- marinated beetroot saladDishes I FAILED:- beef tartatre- pan fried snapper- roast lamb rump- manchego custard","174":"Sooooo good! Fabulous service. Delicious food. I'm definitely coming back. Loved the sea urchin. Loved the scallop ceviche. Roast duck breast was yum. We've been telling all our friends about it. The set lunches are reasonable too.","175":"For pictures and more reviews, visit my blog.Esquina is a haute tapas boutique where patrons perch precariously on weirdly shaped metal stools that will seriously damage some nuts. Not a place for large groups because you can hardly converse farther than your immediate left\/right. Ham Croquetas ($10) is my must order. 4.5cm tall balls filled with creamy bechamel and chunks of what is possibly iberico ham (i expect no less) left us wanting for more. The ham was a little salty but i love it.The Smoked Haddock, spring onion and Manchego omelette ($18) was the fluffiest eggs i've tried in a while. I would liken it to a souffle but firmer. The taste was light; simply flavored with the natural sweetness of the smoked haddock. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.Do order the Sauteed gambas, chili garlic, potato dumplings and bisque sauce ($24) even though it doesn't look spectacular. The prawns were fresh and bouncy and i love the rich bisque sauce so much i could inhale it. Gnocchi were meh.And oh.. the Beef Tartare.. simply divine... Extremely flavorful and smooth tartare, especially after you scoop the confit egg yolk onto it....Read more at ms-skinnyfat","176":"Some have said that one should arrive early to get a seat especially on Fri\/Sat or be prepared to queue. Ironically, we promptly arrive at 6pm but it was only ready for service after 15minutes. The place was about 80% full and the service was insincere for some. There were both hits and misses with the food but one gripe is that the size really can be afforded to be more generous even though they are tapas. Otherwise, it might be better to charge tapas price for tapas rather than main course prices for tapas.Foodwise, it was acceptable to me to experiment with the new creations but not for The Folks who commented that they had no idea what they were eating that night. Perhaps Spanish tapas might not be the cup of tea for everyone but I shall still continue to search for one that will be comfortable not only to the tastebuds but also to our stomachs and pocket.","177":"I love tapas bars so when I heard Jason Atherton had opened one in Singapore, I quickly rounded up a couple of friends to check it out. We waited for about 45 minutes to get seats ... and that was at 930pm. Esquina doesn't take reservations, and I realise upon getting a seat that I might as well have eaten standing because they were really awkward and uncomfortable.Food : Wow, the heritage tomatoes with sherry dressing were something else. Fresh, juicy and sweet ... one of the best tomatoes we have had in a while, including the momotaro ones we usually have in Japanese restaurants. Good ham croquetas and we really loved the gambas as well as the scallop ceviche. The slow cooked egg was quite good and the ox cheek was quite soft and tender. The Iberico pork and foie gras burger was the winner of the night for my two friends however, they couldn't stop raving about it. We also really liked the sangria ice cream cone ... I think it was a daily special though.Ambience : Like the trend that seems to be going around for tapas bars, it also has an industrial chic vibe. But unlike Foodbar Dada, the seats are uncomfortable and almost make us feel they are discouraging diners from getting too comfortable.Service : Quite decent. Even more so when there isn't a service charge levied.Change the chairs goddammit.","178":"Chinatown in Singapore is not exactly where you'd expect to find a top notch Spanish restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0But that's exactly where you'll find Esquina Tapas Bar. \u00c2\u00a0'Esquina' translates to 'corner' and true to its name, the tapas bar is located on a street corner, in Chinatown. This place has serious cooking credentials. \u00c2\u00a0Culinary Director Jason Atherton, notably Gordon Ramsey's protege, Michelin star winner and the first British Chef to complete a stage at the famed el Bulli restaurant in Spain, has teamed up with Irish Executive Chef, Andrew Walsh to create a stunning modern tapas restaurant. Esquina is reminiscent of tapas bars you would find in Spain. \u00c2\u00a0A long, thin hallway with a bar, high stools and an open kitchen provides a chilled, relaxed atmosphere. \u00c2\u00a0It's all about the food here, and you get the feeling you're in for a treat the moment you step through the door.The menu is innovative and exciting and there are also blackboard specials. \u00c2\u00a0This is not your average chorizo and meatball menu, this is a whole other level of tapas entirely. Mr M, who requested to be referred to as 'The Stuntman' in this post (ok, I'll indulge him) and I dine on a Tuesday evening, and it's packed with a cool vibe. \u00c2\u00a0The staff are friendly and we take our stools at the bar with the perfect view of the kitchen. \u00c2\u00a0Executive Chef Andrew Walsh is on-board this evening and he helps us with our menu selections. The Stuntman and I choose our menu as follows:* Iberico Bellota* Tuna Tartare, wasabi celeriac remoulade, vietnamese dressing, crispy shallot (blackboard special)* Marinated beetroot salad, honeycomb burrata, pinenut crumble* Grilled Rib-eye, spice aubegine puree, lentil pearl barley dhal* Baked bone marrow with snails, parsley and horseradish pesto* Berry sorbet (compliments of the chef)* Watermelon salad, gazpacho, basil sorbet The food is exceptional and beautifully presented, with the standouts for me being the beetroot salad and the bone marrow (no easy feat given I wouldn't usually order bone marrow, or snails, for that matter)! This is an underground foodie den and well worth adding to your dining itinerary when you're next travelling through Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Imagine your street cred when you whip out this gem. \u00c2\u00a0I have to say, Singapore has some amazing dining experiences - it's a foodie's paradise, take note!","179":"Went there for dinner, away from kids. I have to say, ingredients used are all fresh. Excellent cooking overall, attentive and friendly service. Highly recommended for night out or casual after work gathering.","180":"Im a massive massive tapas fan, and have spent many a good night in Esquina since it has opened. It has a very cool, industrial chic feeling to the small and narrow dining room. Sitting by the long bar looking across at the chefs prepare everything adds to the experience of this place. Unlike some of the other tapas places around Singapore, the food here is both contemporary and exciting.Had the tuna tartare was both fresh in produce used and flavor, tuna, avocado and sesame, simple , easy and worked really well. Full English breakfast was both a clever play on words and on the palate. \u00c2\u00a0Desserts!! Strawberry gazpacho with basil sorbert was a fantastic way to finish. I've had too many bad basil sorbet experiences in my time, they are either far too sweet or don't resemble basil at all, though this one nailed it and married perfectly with the soup.","181":"Maybe it was because I had high hopes for this place. After looking through the reviews and pictures, I was really excited about the food because they looked beautiful in the posted pictures. Unfortunately, Esquina didn't deliver for me. The plating was beautiful, the service was good, and the decor of the place was chic and pretty. The most important thing though, the taste and flavor of the food, did not do it for me. We ordered all the popular dishes I've read about in the reviews. The pork cracking was just....fried pork skin. The pairing of the herring roe and salt cod mousse did not really push the taste of the pork to greater heights. Instead, it was just in general a flat dish. I have the same criticism for most of their dishes. The ingredients are good, but they just do not come together to deliver a dish of finesse or overlapping flavors. The jambon croquetas were good for what they were, fried cheese balls with ham, but even that was a tad too salty. The whipped burrata with beets was visually an astounding dish to look at, but again the essence of each element did not shine through. The burrata lacked the distinct milky taste, the pinenut crumble did not even taste strongly of pinenuts. So apart from the welcoming acidity the pickled beets brought, the dish was again flat, with no complexity. The uni bisque actually did have a good taste, and chock full of crabmeat that could have been sweeter, but the crab flavor overwhelmed the delicate uni flavor, and as a result, after the initial taste, the uni taste was barely detectable. Arguably the best dish of the night though. The pulled pork and foie gras burgers had good flavors going on, albeit a little too salty. I do appreciate that they blended the foie gras in the pulled pork patty. The sauerkraut was a little redundant though. In general, I thought that the items were overpriced for the taste level and the amount of food served.","182":"Great food but tiny portions. Went for lunch so didn't need to queue at all. Had the steak tartare which was great and the beetroot salad was refreshing. The beef cheek with ox tongue was delish as well. Tip: don't go there hungry unless you have cash to splash!","183":"Definitely a great meal, but for tapas, pricey to the point that it's not worth spending what you will. Rather spend a bit less at a tapas spot like Binomios or Sabios, or spend the money on a full meal.","184":"Absolutely horrendous and unacceptable levels of service. I would have loved to comment on the food but the sad thing is that the food that we ordered did not arrive at all. \u00c2\u00a0We had expected our food to arrive, as we were given fresh plates and cutlery while waiting. After waiting at our table outside the restaurant for approximately 30 minutes, we decided to check on our orders with the waitress\/hostess who took them. When we asked the said waitress about our orders, she simply turned to the kitchen, without acknowledging our query, and asked the crew if our food was on the way. Crew informs her that it was not. The waitress turns back to us and curtly informs us that our food \"is not coming\". No apology was given nor an explanation proffered. Her dismissive attitude was completely shocking. It was as if we had spoilt her evening and put her in a bad mood, and not the other way around. I should point out that we did not even complain about the wait, but merely queried her on whether our food was coming. I don't care how good your food is if you treat your customers like crap. I get that orders sometimes get lost in the process, particularly at a busy joint like this. But no customer should be treated dismissively after a fruitless and unnecessary wait for the food. It's sad that my experience was marred by one person's truly appalling service.","185":"Yes, Jason Atherton does make me gravitate towards Esquina even without asking around if it was any good. While I fully know he's not gonna be cooking my tapas, I had the prior faith that Esquina will justify my good faith, and I won't say I'm disappointed. It's small, it's popular and overcrowded, but if you actually do get a seat by going strategically at 6pm, the rewards are sweet. Watching the finesse of two chefs working\/performing in front of you, agile, swift and serious, I can hardly discount any dish as so-so. The effort is worth half the battle. But have you tasted the gorgeous \u00c2\u00a0heritage tomatoes or the slow cooked eggs? I'm not saying that you will NEVER taste any better, for what I have to pay for them, I'd say dish them out every dinner! It's definitely worth my money, the consistent doneness of the egg with the patatas brava spin off is awesome. If the leg of ham doesn't instill any faith in how serious they are, I don't know what will.","186":"A true local joint in the middle of Raffles Place. It's the only place I know in the heart of the business district where you can get great local food past 9pm. The Salted Fish fried rice is amazing. Honestly, any of the fried rice dishes are a good bet. The Bee Hoon and the Char Kway Teow are decent, especially late at night when you are trying to find something to hold you over after a night of drinking.Located at the basement of the Singapore Land Tower (or next door at the very least), this is a no frills drinking establishment. You come here for two main purposes: (i) too drink amongst friends and (ii) to try out the surprisingly good Asian cuisine -- yes, I know the place is Italian, but the Asian \/ SG food is soo much better! P.S there is a sexy painting of the owner (scantily clad) hanging right next to the bar. It's a pretty cute touch, if you ask me. :D","187":"This is really more of a 3.5 star place, but it has some positives going for it so I'll give it a 4.It can be a bit hard to find if you're not familiar with the Raffles Place area. If you're coming from the MRT, I would take Exit A\/B, go past Chevron House (but away from One Raffles Place) and when you see the CIMB branch, find the staircase, go down, and it will be there.When my husband told me to meet him and a few of his colleagues here for drinks on a Friday night, I scoffed because I thought, \"I've never heard of this place, it's in the basement level, and it's probably lame.\" However, it surprised me. The wine, though nothing special, was reasonably priced per glass (around $13-15) and my linguine alla carbonara was quite delicious. Despite it being pretty busy, it didn't take too long for my food to come out. In addition to Italian food, they also serve some Chinese dishes. I know it sounds a bit strange, but apparently the locals say it's pretty solid. According to one of Miguel's colleagues, he tried their foie gras fried rice and loved it, but it might've been a seasonal dish as it wasn't on the menu and our server didn't seem to know what it was. Miguel did try the pork belly fried rice and thought it was top notch.Maybe lunch is a different story, but for dinner, the restaurant seems to exude this sleaziness that I can't explain. Perhaps it's because we're in the basement and there's no windows? Or maybe it's the clientele (mostly businessmen) added in with the mostly female staff (but in their defense, they don't dress like sluts.) Then there's the decor- yes, Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus\" is a tasteful nude... but when an almost-nude photo of the owner is included in the mix*, well... what are we supposed to think?Despite all of that, I did enjoy the food and I appreciated the relaxed atmosphere at the start of the weekend. To be honest, I wouldn't mind coming back so I could sample that pork belly fried rice!--*To her credit, she did look good in that photo and she still looks good now. Apparently, if you ask her, she is willing to pose next to you if you want to take a picture with it.","188":"Take away is.... would i return... YES! \u00c2\u00a0Rendang... nice. \u00c2\u00a0kelauh a tad sour but like the way they smooth out and stuff it back it. \u00c2\u00a0Lodeh pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0Keuh D D unfortunately was served a little cold inside. \u00c2\u00a0Tasted ok but the texture of the wrapping too smooth. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps a new rendition?","189":"We enjoyed a LoHei banquet here and couldn't fault the food, service or upbeat atmosphere.The venue is very traditional so is not for those seeking a modern environment but the menu is delicious and authentic with reasonable and pricey options.There is little natural light or outside views so whatever the time you visit, it feels like night time.","190":"Traditional Cantonese dim sum in nice traditional chinese restaurant setting. No fancy fusion nonsense here just good old fashion dim sum done the good old fashion way. The steamed dishes were especially good, fresh and clean on the palate. No worries about overly salty or flavoured food here. My personal favourites are the steamed pork ribs and steamed bean curd skin rolls. Easily one of the best I ate in awhile.Important tip though: it is a hugely popular restaurant especially on weekends so either get here really early or make your reservations in advance. Personally I like coming when they just open in the morning to enjoy my dim sum and tea in peace and quiet.","191":"This used to be one of the restaurants that we visit for dim sum lunches but after the recent visit, it shall be the last time. I was surprised that a restaurant that was once packed with families during Sunday lunch time now is dead town. There were only 8-10 dim sum items available and the reason for such dismal selection is the head chef is no longer working at this restaurant. The service staff were busy bickering with each other instead of paying attention to the guests.The peking duck and vegetable dishes are decent but the limited dim sum selection tasted mundane.Will not be going back, seems like the regular customers have also chosen not to...","192":"This review is for a fantastic dim-sum lunch a couple of months ago.For now, there is a dim-sum lunch special. All dim-sum is at half price! 50% off!Dragon Phoenix has been my family's favourite dim sum place for a while.

Staff that know their stuff, refills the teapot promptly and brings your mustard for your dim sum.For food, this restaurant delivers what it promised: Cantonese cuisine! And dim sum being quintessentially cantonese, who can deny?For value, the dim sum special (half-price) is the best time to try everything and then some. \u00c2\u00a0This restaurant has a space in my heart, as a reminder of good times with my family and some of the best dim sum I've enjoyed.","193":"During our recent trip to Singapore, I realized that owning a Chinese restaurant in a city filled with a gazillion Chinese Restaurants must be tough. \u00c2\u00a0A restaurant has to be really good, as well as innovative. \u00c2\u00a0I do think that Dragon Phoenix fits that bill.This hidden gem is on the 6th floor of the Novotel Hotel which sits right on Clarke Quay. \u00c2\u00a0The location is convenient and there is parking! For Hawaii readers, this restaurant reminds me of Royal Garden in the Ala Moana Hotel. \u00c2\u00a0It is a dimly lit, elegant Chinese restaurant with table cloths and beautiful rosewood chairs and wall paneling. This is the kind of Chinese restaurant where the food is not slammed down or rushed. \u00c2\u00a0We ate here twice - once for dim sum and then several days later for dinner. \u00c2\u00a0Dim Sum was a very delicious. \u00c2\u00a0We had the usual steamed char siu bao, xioo long bao, look fun, spare ribs, etc. \u00c2\u00a0All of it was hot and fresh. \u00c2\u00a0Hard to mention more than that as dim sum in Singapore is pretty much always delicious. \u00c2\u00a0 However, we had a couple of different items that I've never seen before. \u00c2\u00a0First were these pumpkin looking dim sum. \u00c2\u00a0They were a mild pumpkin flavored flour wrap with a custard inside. \u00c2\u00a0They were really neat and different. \u00c2\u00a0The other interesting item was the Spring Rolls that were twice as long. \u00c2\u00a0The difference in presentation really made you want to try it. \u00c2\u00a0yelp.com\/biz_photos\/drag\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The best meal we had here though was dinner. \u00c2\u00a0We were treated to a magnificent dinner in one of the private rooms. \u00c2\u00a0Each dish that came out was amazing! \u00c2\u00a0The highlight of the dinner was the whole Suckling Roast Pig. \u00c2\u00a0The skin was so thin and crispy and was served with these pancakes. \u00c2\u00a0It was to die for! \u00c2\u00a0 yelp.com\/biz_photos\/drag\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Another notable dish was the Shark's Fin Soup. \u00c2\u00a0To be honest, we never thought we would ever eat this dish again now that it is illegal in Hawaii. \u00c2\u00a0I did feel a bit guilty though. \u00c2\u00a0yelp.com\/biz_photos\/drag\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The last dish that I loved and would go back to eat was the Taro Ring with vegetables. \u00c2\u00a0I've had the taro \"basket\" before which is like eating hard chips. \u00c2\u00a0This dish was mashed taro that was deep fried where the outside was deliciously crispy (not hard) with a melt in your mouth mashed taro inside. \u00c2\u00a0yelp.com\/biz_photos\/drag\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Service here was amazing. \u00c2\u00a0We had Maggie serve us both times and she is a delightful lady and totally on it. \u00c2\u00a0We always had clean plates, filled water and tea. \u00c2\u00a0She even portioned out most of the dishes. \u00c2\u00a0I loved how she urged us to eat the Taro Ring while it was hot. \u00c2\u00a0We enjoyed chatting with her about her world travels. \u00c2\u00a0Hopefully, the next time we're in Singapore we can go back to Dragon Phoenix for more delicious food and to see Maggie!","194":"I found this place from recommendations in TripAdvisor and I have to say I was not disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0It was exactly what I was looking for on a chilled out Friday evening. \u00c2\u00a0I think I must have timed my visit perfectly as the general area that this cafe is in was not too busy and I was immediately sat down at my choice of table with the owner and his daughters giving me their full attention. \u00c2\u00a0On asking what they recommended I was shown the Kind Prawns and given several options as to what way I wanted them marinated. \u00c2\u00a0I chose the black pepper stir fry option and have to say that I have yet to try better in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The food was really fresh and cooked to perfection, obviously with some care and the portion size was huge. \u00c2\u00a0 I thought the free home roasted peanuts was also a nice touch. \u00c2\u00a0 I also had a very tasty mushroom soup for starter and the house favourite spring rolls.The general atmosphere around the cafe is one of ease and I did not mind having to wait for my meal to arrive as you know they are cooking it to order. \u00c2\u00a0As it was the weekend there was also some nice live background music being played by a local band. \u00c2\u00a0Having thoroughly enjoyed my meal, chatting to the owner and the overall experience I will definitely be making a point of coming back here again soon with friends.","195":"Sooo good! We've been looking for a really good South \/ North Indian restaurant. Try the Butter Chicken Marsala - great stuff! The marsala tea as nice and spicy. I've never had a cheese naan like the one they make here - thick cheese. Great food! Good prices.","196":"Great restaurant near Mustafa. Most lunch specials are about $10, which is quite reasonable. They serve you papadums as an appetizer. We tried:-roti prata with chicken currry: you can never go wrong with roti prata. They did a great job. -fish curry with basamati: delicious, not too spicy-mango lassi: deliciousOverall, a great restaurant with good AC. It was quite popular during lunch time too.","197":"We came here being quite disappointed with the Indian cuisine available around other popular eateries in the island. We had heard good things but were worried that it would also turn up in disappointment.We were very pleasantly surprised. This is exactly what we were after, and not only at a reasonable price but with fantastic service.The flavours were not bland at all, but rich and very aromatic. The level of spice was great, not too overwhelming but rather enough to complement the food.We will definitely be visiting again, and expect that we will be visiting regularly throughout our stay in Singapore.","198":"Oh my goodness how did I forget about this place. I am a regular at the Mustafa Center and this place should not be missed! It is in a really strategic location I have been here once and this is your typical grab and go Indian food. I highly recommend it if you are in a rush. It is the right place to satisfy an Indian food craving. The place is not too shabby. The kabobs are actually quite good it does taste better than how I had it in the USDrawback: the food is a bit on the medium price side. It doesn't fit well. The food gets cold easily so please get it while it's hot. This place can feel real empty. I was expecting a really lively place bur the reality shows me that it's not that good.","199":"Rooftop restaurant of Mustafa Centre, and in the same character\/style as the store: plebeian d\u00c3\u00a9cor and ambience; open from 11 am to 1 am; all varieties of South Asian food - North Indian, South Indian, Pakistani, even Indo-Chinese (ie. Chinese dishes cooked with Indian spices, extremely difficult to find even in India and certainly outside); moderate prices; Halal-certified. You'll be spoiled by the different varieties of dosa and biryanis. Not terribly refreshing, but surprise, surprise - one of the most flavourful Indian food in Singapore! Even if you don't plan to shop at Mustafa, worth a trip!","200":"Summary: \u00c2\u00a0Bad Quality & Over Priced. \u00c2\u00a0$15+tax for 4 pieces of VERY COLD chicken tandoori (note: \u00c2\u00a0you have to pay extra for naan). \u00c2\u00a0I don't mind to pay premium for quality, but when quality is compromised in a typical location, there is no reason to pay for an overpriced meal. \u00c2\u00a0I give 2 stars to this place just because service was decent.","201":"We recently visited Singapore and went to this restaurant Kebabs n Curries, the ambience of the place was not that great but since we wanted to try desi food we gave it a shot, the service was ok quality and taste was also very average, the only thing which we liked was the rasmalai which was very tasty, the feel of the restaurant was not very clean and so was the cutlery, well near by there were many options for desi food, I would next time rather try some other restaurant then going to this place.","202":"[Review is for ala carte only]What started off as a sweet and romantic (cough) date atop Little India ended up with a hurried exit from Mustafa in cold sweat rushing back to the hotel for the ultimate rendezvous with the porcelain altar.It started off great! First, we were really excited to be exploring Little India and especially Mustafa Centre going - with all the endless goods available within. Second, we were both craving some form of Indian-influenced-cuisine and got ourselves through the Mustafa maze to the entrance of Kebabs n Curries the moment they opened at 11 am for lunch.We wanted to try the buffet based on the previous Yelp review but was advised by one of the servers that it would take an estimated 30 minutes to 1 hour before it would be ready. Famished people don't wait...that's a fact...so ala carte it is!I wanted to be more excited about the food but it was a rather disappointing $50 meal.Paired with the runs and rather bland flavors...I'd say skip this place altogether and go for one of the mom-pop shops in the area instead. Oh yeah, if this is how bad ala carte gets...I can only wonder if their buffet standards have also dipped since the previous review.Yelp 100: 23\/100","203":"Good place for reasonably priced north Indian, south Indian, Pakistani and Indian Chinese food. Service is good and friendly. I have been seeing the same service staff for over 3 years now and I think that says good things about a place, I think :)The food is good and reasonably priced compared to other options in Little India where the same food is at least 20% more expensive. I like the curries - both indian and pakistani. \u00c2\u00a0The Biryani platter is good value for money too.Try the tea at the end of the meal. I would even stick my neck out that its one of the best tea in little india.","204":"Looking for cheap indian buffet? It is not surprising that you can find it at the infamous place has it all... Mustafa. Kebabs n Curries is a restaurant that is located at the roof top of the new Mustafa's wing that resembles the esplanade dome. They dish out yummy indian lunch buffet at $14.90. I love their Masala Paneer . You can have all you can eat of curries, papadams and other indian snacks. Do note that you need to be patience as the refill of the dishes are kinda of slow. \u00c2\u00a0If curry buffet is too much for you to handle, you might want to try their Dum biryani.","205":"This new establishment elevates one above the chaos of Little India. 400-seater big, this eatery is perfect for the family with affordable pricing and the patrons are all in casual local drab such as slippers and shorts. There is an indoor and outdoor area - where the open wooden deck overlooks the bustling Little India street. Food wise, the menu is dominated by North and South Indian staples. The mango lassi ($3) garnished with dried coconut sprinkles is one of the best in town. Other good things to try would be the garlic and butter naan, or tandoor spiced chicken on skewers. There is no alcohol served here, but with the delectable Lassi beverage, who needs alcohol.","206":"Ate non vegetarian platter combo 24$S. It reaaly did have meat: chicken tikka, chicken tandoori, spicy sausage, yellow curry chicken. Ate with roti. Ice tea was warm tea with ice, milk, sugar. Air cond. Buffet available if hungary.","207":"Came here for refreshments and did not disappoint. I ordered the mock tail and it was good. A bit expensive though.","208":"This place was ok, not great. I had the palek paneer and garlic naan, but the palek was too salty for my taste and the naan was also a bit too oily. My auntie had this spicy chicken and veggie dish which was just too oily. The taste was there, but damn that excess oil killed it. The price was also pretty reasonable. I did enjoy the environment though. Its on the rooftop and the fans provide a nice little breeze. But I think if it were any hotter outside it would be a little unpleasant to eat spicy curry and be in a hot restaurant with leather chairs. Not pretty!","209":"This place was suppose to be good. The butter chicken--good, the naan-good, the lamb kebabs we ordered--not so much.The thing that the restaurant is famous for made me sick. Like, Sorry friends I can't talk to you right now---I'll be in the bathroom for a few days sick.bummer. I wanted it to be good!","210":"We came here hungry on the first day of our trip. We found it by following the many signs within the Mustafa center for food. Although we had been expecting a food court with many options we were not disappointed when we found one restaurant because of the great ambiance and food.FoodI love curry and eat it all the time in the states this is definitely one of my favorites that I've had. Chicken Makhani was excellent as was the tender lamb shank in a brown curry sauce.Naan: Perfect, thin and crispy sheets of dough with oil and garlic lathered on top. The compliment of choice for a curry feast.AmbianceIt's on the top or 7th floor of the Mustafa center commanding an expansive view of the area. Reminiscent of a Japanese feng shui garden the floors are marble with pools interspersing under a white tented dome.Highly recommend this to travelers that don't mind a little spice.","211":"There are several seating arrangements: Open-roof, Covered-roof, Big Hall etc. The open-roof part of the restaurant is dark but nice ambience. The food is North-Indian, Pakistani and Indian Chinese. The dishes are economical and quantity is good. Service is usually quick and helpful.","212":"Stopped in to have coffee and drinks.. ordered coffee, sweet Lassi and mocktail.. not disappointed at all.. a little pricey but nice","213":"Rrriibbiiitttt....So one our friends took us on a adventure on the outskirts of the city to go and have some fresh frog. We were hesitant at first but we decided, why not. Boy were we wrong. The quintessential local experience of eating out on the sidewalk a few blocks down from where happy endings are made and the rolling of the dice on a picnic table. I guess gotta everyone gets famished after having some fun. Ok on to the main reason. We sat down on the picnic tables and the plastic seats and ordered our meal. First came the oyster omellete, it was interesting, scrambled egg paired with oysters. Then came \u00c2\u00a0the porridge and As you ladled the frog \u00c2\u00a0the saucy goodness just hugged the delicate meat that was prepared fresh. \u00c2\u00a0 There were quite a few of them tucked away in the clay pot, enough to feed the 3 of us. Then came the deep fried legs, the spicy sauce the accompanied the dish was a little spicy for me. Spice is the life there. I had to tamper down the heat and ordered a fresh coconut. Boy did that help. Don't be scared go and try it.","214":"It was a relatively cool night outside and I was starting to pace around from a grumbling tummy running on empty.Time to go explore for some cheat day indulgence! I carb up only once a month, so I definitely gotta make it count.Have been hearing tales of frog porridge from various colleagues. \u00c2\u00a0Since it's obviously not a thing that is easily available back home, what better time to go try some!Of course, conferred with the trusty Yelp app and found Geylang Lor 9 to be the most consistently raved about frog porridge joint in the area. \u00c2\u00a0Sounds like dinner is served!Found, sat, ordered, and waited just a few quick minutes for the food to hit the table.First, the fried oysters w\/ egg were amazing! \u00c2\u00a0Cooked just right and I didn't really need to throw any additional sauce on it. \u00c2\u00a0I was trying to save a few bites so that I can have it with the porridge, but it was completely demolished within a minute or two. \u00c2\u00a0Should have ordered the large...The frogs (ordered 2) came in a sizzling clay pot and the porridge came separately in another clay pot. \u00c2\u00a0Tried a bit of the porridge on its own and it was very light - just a bit of ginger and scallion with minimal salt. \u00c2\u00a0It's meant to be taken with something bolder and the spicy frog was just the thing.The kung bao sauce was deep and carried a nice warming heat from the clay pot. \u00c2\u00a0Sauce was also a bit on the sweet side, which helped smooth out the spice. \u00c2\u00a0The frog was cooked perfectly! \u00c2\u00a0The texture is a mix better really good fish and chicken - super tender with just enough resistance on every bite.I thought I wasn't going to be able to finish the porridge originally. \u00c2\u00a0However, once paired up with that frog and kung bao sauce, the whole pot just disappeared...The 2 frogs & porridge ran about S$20, plus small fried oysters was S$5. \u00c2\u00a0Overall, I thought it was pretty decent for value since I pretty much ate about 3 people's amount.Mission accomplished & a successful carb day!","215":"The 3rd food item that one must try while in Singapore is Frog Porridge. \u00c2\u00a0This place was recommended by our local friends. They serve hot sticky rice porridge and froglegs in claypots. We also ordered fried froglegs and egged oysters. The only thing that I noticed was that the place did not provide any papernakins. The customers must buy them. I guess when you are worldly famous, you can have that kind of attitude and will still be fine. Their food is so good.","216":"The frog here's cooked JUST enough that it maintains more the texture of a firm-fleshed whitefish than of a chicken - which is great! It's snappy and tastes very fresh, despite the fact that they don't have the frogs lined up in tanks outside like the other establishments in the area. I have mixed feelings about this - I do feel like we should confront the fact that our porridge requires murder, so the uncomfortableness I feel when I see the frogs in the tank is a plus for me.I got my frog - just one - 'dry chili' style, which is still pretty wet-sauced. This is nice because the sauce bleeds into the porridge and gives it some flavor.","217":"This is the go to place for frog porridge or frog casserole. Frog seems to be a delightful delicacy in the Geylang area. We ordered the fresh frog porridge, chili frog leg and ginger spring onion frog leg. Everything is served in a hot stone pot and it was an extremely hot day but it was worth it. This place opens at 12PM and closes at 3:45AM. The fresh coconut water served in a coconut was extremely refreshing. People may be deterred from eating frog but it tastes like chicken but the texture is more similar to dark meat.","218":"This place has a huuuge seating area and for good reason. It's famous for its frog leg porridge, so popular that it's now a chain in Malaysia, China, Taiwan, and Indonesia.We were actually looking for a small snack, so we ordered a small claypot ginger spring onion frog instead of porridge. It was very flavorful, albiet a bit salty without rice. The pieces of frog were quite decently sized, and very springy and fresh. It's definitely not that dirt cheap street food though, and ran ~S$9 for a small claypot with about 4-5 large pieces. The guy taking our order was a bit strange, constantly trying to upsell us to get a large even though we insisted that we already ate dinner and were just having a quick snack...It wasn't really a quick snack though, because of course they cook everything fresh to order, so we were anxiously waiting for about 15-20 minutes while everyone else around us seemed to be getting served their food! Next time gotta try the actual porridge...","219":"Amazing experience!!! I love atmosphere of street food. This place is one of the best! Huge seating area! I went there with my buddy who lives in Singapore. We ordered rice porridge with frog stew \u00c2\u00a0& watercress saut\u00c3\u00a9ed with sambal. Frog stew was perfectly spicy. Mixing a lot of stew with rice porridge in the cray...I love that. Watercress saut\u00c3\u00a9ed with sambal also spicy. Combination between two of these will definitely burn my _ss off through that humidity but I was happy to let it be because it was sooooo goodddd! Yummy!!","220":"Tastes like chicken, and you can hardly know it's frogs legs that you're eating unless you look and really take a slow chew. You'll be bombared by the various frogs legs porridge walking along this street, but I like Geylang lor9 cause is right beside the famous beef kuey teow and the friend oyster here tastes yummy.","221":"Good balance of flavour and taste.The porridge is cantonese style, like congee, with ginger! Add the sauce it taste heavenly.The frog are fresh, but somehow it lack a certain oomph. Without the black sauce it's just taste like chicken.","222":"My to go to frog porridge place every time I am back in Singapore. My absolute favorite. Best paired with oyster egg from the stall beside and the beef kway teow from across the street. You can just sit and order and they will bring all of it to ur table. Love the spicy version with porridge and I usually get the large size for 2. :)","223":"I like frogs... Yam yam... Taste like chicken but the bone is hard.I took frog porridge and Mee goreng (flavorful and spicy fried noodle dish)Location is close to hotels.Located in street side, dark place, but dun worry, l felt safe... \u00c2\u00a0in midnight.Good for local people not too good for foreigners","224":"Not cheap, but it's my grandpa's favorite frog legs! The sauce is very flavorful and I can have porridge with the sauce only, and be completely happy.","225":"One of the better frog porridge. I like the dried chili but the ginger & green onion is good too.For the uninitiated, the frog are live in a cage. They're killed just before cooking. So they're very fresh. You get the whole frog, not just the legs.Give them a try. I think they opened a branch in Bukit Timah.","226":"The only time I've ever eaten frog legs was last Easter in Paris, smothered in butter and cream sauce. \u00c2\u00a0So when my friends in Singapore asked if I wanted some frog legs, I said, sure, why not.This was an interesting combo of frog legs cooked in a clay pot and then served with rice porridge. \u00c2\u00a0I said I didn't like spice, so they ordered a plain one for me, and a spicy one for the others. \u00c2\u00a0The frog legs came in a sweet sauce that was nice as it soaked into the rice porridge.A bit strange for dinner though, because the only times I've eaten rice porridge in the past was either:1) when I was sick and my mother made it for me when I was little, or2) after a night of clubbing the O.C. with Vietnamese-Chinese Americans, and we ate it with steamed fish to rehydrate after a night of drinking and partying.The most interesting thing for me is that we didn't actually eat at this establishment. \u00c2\u00a0We happened to be eating at the Beef Kway Teow across the street, and then one guy ran over to place our order, and then they served us at the table for the other other restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0I guess this is common here, but I've never heard of anything like that before.","227":"This is a review of lunch from the Geylang Lor 9 Fresh Frog Leg Porridge stall.We actually headed to Geylang for lunch because a colleague wanted to take me to a different stall that is across the street from here. \u00c2\u00a0We discovered that it is closed on Mondays during the daytime.So, we decided to hit up Geylang Lor 9 Fresh Frog Leg Porridge for some frog's legs.The ambiance is what it is; you do not go here for a white table cloth and a waiter serenading the table. \u00c2\u00a0You go to get great food. \u00c2\u00a0tinyurl.com\/b2od8roI would not call the staff friendly. \u00c2\u00a0Ok, I would not even call them hospitable. \u00c2\u00a0But, once again, that is not why we were there. \u00c2\u00a0We just wanted some fantastic frog's legs and we got them.We did order the porridge. \u00c2\u00a0We just ordered the frog's lefs straight \u00c2\u00a0up with some rice on the side.We ordered two types.Dried Chili & Ginger Spring Onion. \u00c2\u00a0They were both very good. \u00c2\u00a0I preferred the dried chili ones though. \u00c2\u00a0I liked the heat. \u00c2\u00a0Eating frog's legs always reminds me of eating chicken wings. \u00c2\u00a0These were no different. \u00c2\u00a0They were delicious saucy messes. \u00c2\u00a0I enjoyed every bite. \u00c2\u00a0The soup in each was also provided a tasty treat.Dried Chili Frog's Legstinyurl.com\/a6axd42Ginger Spring Onion Frog's Legstinyurl.com\/bkeh384Ignore the surly attendant. \u00c2\u00a0Ignore the general disarray. \u00c2\u00a0Enjoy the tasty frog's legs!","228":"I love eating it with their hot piping porridge. Love both the ginger onion and the kungpao versions. The meat is always served just perfectly cooked, and not overcooked like in some places.Even if you are not a frog leg fan, there are oyster omelette and the famed beef horfun from across the street.plus, you get the usual Geylang parking woes s bonus.","229":"I've been here twice now and I'm not sure if my expectations for frog porridge are high (and why should they be?) or if my memories of frog porridge are long lost dreams instead of real life experiences. Lor 9 specializes in two flavors, dry chili and ginger spring onion. The latter was definitely on the sweeter side, with a gooey caramelized glaze. Out of the two, I enjoyed the dry chili more--the gooey caramel sauce was an overkill. The consistency of the plain porridge hits the target. It's not too watery, overcooked, but nice and thick! Similar to the frog, it comes in a piping hot clay pot! Plain porridge is an additional cost at $2. Tip: Order some beef hor fun across the street. They'll bring the dish across the street to where you are sitting. Geylang Lor 9 Fresh Frog Leg Porridge will not do the same.","230":"Nose-to-tail eating doesn't seem to have taken off in the majority Chinese populated Singapore. I find it strange because we Chinese are (supposedly) familiar with offals and innards (hello kway chup), so much that we even eat that for breakfast (sometimes). It thoroughly surprises and bewilders us that a gorgeous Spanish restaurant like Dehesa isn't packed every night (like Esquina). Perhaps they have gone overboard with their marketing of their \"inner\" beauty? For those who are intimidated by the alternative cuts and random parts, your fears are unfounded. Chef-Owner Jean-Philippe Patruno aka JP, previously of Bomba Paella Bar and Una, fires up more than just the grey matter. Classic Spanish dishes are available here and he's more than adept at delivering them. I let my weakness for Croquetas (4 pcs, $14) take over and swooned in bliss as I bit into the creamy filling encased in the crunchy panko crust. This is one smooth morsel! Make sure you give it a good chew together with the spiced paprika aioli and jam\u00c3\u00b3n joselito. I struggled with my need to finish this and saving space for my main meal. That should ease you into starters. If you don't go into the nitty gritty, the Dehesa platter of cold meats ($32), is what you would likely order at any other restaurant- a rotating homemade charcuterie consisting pate, lardo, deep-fried pork scratchings. We all know where the ingredients are from, we don't need to be told\/reminded, other than how good they taste. Well if that doesn't go down well, take a few bites of the smoky Pimientos De Padron ($14). They will sure cleanse the palate of any gamey leftovers. If you're not for the cold platters, have the Chorizo ($24) which is served with soft cooked eggs and a smoked mash, and pork crackling! This comfort food combination never fails. If only I could find some bread to go with this.The Dehesa Octopus ($28) was one of my favorites! The tentacles were tantalizingly tender and well seasoned. They are served on a bed of crushed creamy potatoes with some sour bits (I couldn't figure out they were pickles). A thin slice of lardo (cured lard) tops the dish and is torched upon service. This provided a salty smoky note to the dish. Too good!!From the Specials menu, we had the Figateddu Pork Sausage ($17) which is made with blood and liver. \u00c2\u00a0We were warned of the strong flavors but I was more \u00c2\u00a0shocked by the how salty my dish was. The liver and blood part was a walk in the park really. It was tasty no doubt, especially that crunchy potato galette which is like a deep-fried Kouign Amann! To balance the saltiness, have one of the vegetable dishes. We had the light tasting Beets ($24) which featured a round of fresh burrata with pickled beetroot and toasted walnuts. Mild it was, but we needed to calm our tongues before moving on. Another highlight of our dinner was the Squid Ink Arroz ($28 serves 2). The short grain Cebolla rice has absorbed all the lovely seafood flavors and then topped with an umami-rich seafood sauce. Superb seafood on that lightly spiced black rice btw.From the Specials Menu, we also had the Braised Beef Cheeks ($36) with an Oloroso glaze. The meat was well flavored by the red wine and had a gelatinous texture to it. We also had the Bone Marrow ($34) served with sea salt. Well i absolutely don't get the appeal of bone marrow. It's tasteless! Anyway, the one at Dehesa was bland and oily for me. Perhaps it has to do with the way it's prepared. If the bone were sliced into halves, the fatty collagen would be flavored more easily. Instead of the bone marrow, i'd go with the Crispy Suckling Pig ($65 quarter\/115 half\/199 whole pig) next time. Try it and let me know! For the whole pig, make sure you place your order beforehand.For desserts, we had the Melon Sorbet ($14) which was spiked with negroni! This is made in house by Chef daily and i liked that it wasn't too sweet. Dehesa also has a Daily Tart on the menu and it was Apple Tart ($12) when we visited. The soft caramelized apples were almost jam-like and i enjoyed the tartness of the fruit. We were pretty sure there's some alcohol in this! Please go visit Dehesa if you want a good Spanish meal! I'm not paid to say good things about them but i really feel that they are super underrated. There's no need to be intimidated by the nose-to-tail concept really, Dehesa is that and more.","231":"Go go go!! Solid Spanish food with fresh ingredients and a very high level of creativity.This review is specifically on lunch.I've gone here twice after my Ritual workout next door and am in love with this spot. I order the following:1) Jamon Croquettas - SO GOOD!! Much better than the other Spanish restaurants I've had in Singapore.2) Pulled Pork Sandwich - Best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had in my life. They also give homemade potato crisps with this which is also on point.3) Pandan Ice Cream - Pandan Ice Cream at a Spanish restaurant? What? Regardless, this was a nice touch.Highly recommend checking this place out since it only just opened. Great service and staff, intimate and comfortable setup. Will be back soon!","232":"Had dinner at Dehesa last June when we were back visiting from LA. Came back again this past Thursday evening for dinner and thought I should write a review since there was only one previous review.The food is very solid Spanish cooking. Chef Jean-Philippe is a very gracious host. Started the evening with several Spanish white wines: - Gewurztraminer, light floral with dry finish, very different than most I have drank. - Sauvignon Blanc, lighter finish than most Sauvignon Blanc if you are used to New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs.- Chardonnay, never had a Spanish Chardonnay before. I think this may be un-oaked. Definitely my favorite of the evening.Appetizers:- Pimentos De Padrones: blistered peppers, very similar to Charred\/Blistered Shishito peppers which is what I am most used to. 4\/5- Jamon Joselito: not much I can say since the Jason speaks for itself. 5\/5- toasted bread with Aioli (not sure of the name of the dish since I do not think it was on the menu) 4\/5- toasted bread with anchovies: love this dish since anchovies on anything makes it taste better. 5\/5Jason Croquettas: very good croquettes served with Aioli. 5\/5- Gambas Ajillo: everyone loved this dish so much we ordered seconds. The bread served with it was good for soaking up the delicious garlicky sauce. 5\/5- octopus topped with lardo: the lardo was thinly sliced and flame torched. Very unusual dish. 4\/5- crab Paella (not on the menu): Chef JP made this for us and was delicious! Nice Socarrat (the crusty rice at the bottom of the pan) which is a good sign that this is a good paella. And it was. The crabs were cut in half which makes eating it much easier. 5\/5Pork skin tagliatelle: This was a special on the blackboard. It is pork skin that has been steamed and sliced to be like pasta and tossed with a ragu of some kind. It was okay, seemed like a lot of work to make something look and have the texture of pasta. 3\/5- Cotes De Boeuf: the beef was nicely cooked medium and served with thick fries. By now we were very full after so many dishes. 4\/5- radish\/pear\/pomegranate salad: this was our only vegetable dish. 4\/5Deserts were definitely the chef's strong points. We shared 3 deserts off the menu: - torijas\/plum\/Creme fraiche. This was French toast that I believe was stuffed with mascarpone. Served with sliced plums and crime fraiche. 5\/5- Laredo flan\/ caramelized pancetta. Excellent! 5\/5- chocolat\/olive oil\/salt: This was chef JP's signature desert. On yelp you will find several pictures of this desert. 5\/5Service was excellent and food nicely paced.

Like Salted egg crabs, Butter prawns and my favourite The winter melon soup. \u00c2\u00a0They also have regular stuff such as Sweet sour pork, hot plate toufu , etc. The prices are reasonable!","235":"Was brought to this place by my friend who lives around the area.We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. Since my friend was a regular here, he was able to recommend a bunch of dishes that he always ordered. These include the sweet and sour pork ribs king and the crispy fried chicken.The sweet and sour pork ribs king was really good. There was a substantial amount of meat and and I really liked the taste of it. The meat was tender enough.The crispy fried chicken came as a surprise to me; I know that fried chicken usually tastes good, but this one was absolutely delicious. The skin was very well fried, which gave it a perfect crisp texture. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken meat itself was really tender and juicy, and overall, it's been a while since I\"ve had such good \u00c2\u00a0chicken.The service in this place was good; very prompt and attentive. Overall a nice place for a meal.","236":"Great selection of French wines at a reasonable price. Food menu is good, but could have a bit more variety. I really like the ambiance here, cozy without being too noisy. Will be back for sure!","237":"Simple food menus but pretty divine food. Definitely go for the cheese plus meat board... \u00c2\u00a0creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e was a must too. \u00c2\u00a0The wine was good too although they ran out of the Aussie ones. \u00c2\u00a0We will happily go back.","238":"Excellent wine choices. Food menu is small, main focus being shared plates. We tried a range of items and found the starters and savoury tarts very very good. We found the Iberico pork and grilled octopus dishes overdone. Otherwise service and food quality very good. Will visit again.","239":"What strikes me is the queue at 9 am on Saturday. People in line are just very patient. As I get closer, I understood why, the order taker, Alex, is just supper friendly, helpful and patient! There was a customer who upon looking at her prepared food, said she didn't want Char Siew. Alex said, no problem. Took it back to remove and the rest of the team were nice about it too!We tried their regular and dark sauce wan ton Mee and they are simply delicious! And the pig trotters rice packed for lunch. It tastes just as wonderful after 3 hours! Definitely will be back!!","240":"As a guest in this country I rely on my coworkers to help me find the best local places to eat and this was one of the best lunches I've had here. The soup was delicious, the noodles were fresh and I got to try a sparkling Fuji Apple drink that I fell in love with. Thanks to my fellow Apple employees For bringing me to this fantastic al fresco eatery!","241":"The stall was located inside a coffeeshop. It was well known for its thai style wanton noodles and attracted long queue. But today it was raining quite heavily during lunch time, and it like a queue of 8 persons in front of me, so was too bad. While queuing up the staff took order and payment. Don't forget to help yourself to the condiements such as deep fried lards, green chilli, and chilli flakes.Wanton Mee Regular with extra ingredients ($5)The serving looked fairly small in the huge bowl. Although the noodles looked rather dry without sauce, it was quite tasty on its own. The cured fish sausage was not bad, topped with 2 pieces of deep fried wantons, but the char siew was lacking the sweetness which I preferred. It served with 2 wantons in soup. Pig intestines ($2)It was served with slices of raw garlic. The serving looked quite small. Although tender, the intestines still had a quite powdery texture with a slight bitter taste. A hint of need of a better cleaning job.Overall food was not bad but I felt it was a tab overpriced.","242":"People have always been asking me whether I have tried Soi 19 Thai Wanton Mee since it is right in my hood and even within walking distance. And so I braved the crowd and possibility of long-waiting time and head there on a busy Sunday 10.50am Started queuing 11.45am At the front of waiting line. Not too long, considering the fact that I can skip the transport time. I have no idea what's a good authentic Thai-style wanton Mee ( eavesdropped on the next table and learnt that it was like Koko Mee) NO CHILLI, but there is your Pizza Hut Chilli flakes (add it in, you won't regret). NO GRAVY, but the seasoning is sufficient already (bottle of fish sauce on standby at the counter) FREE FLOW of PORK LARD which I decided not to take advantage of since there were more than enough of that crispy wickedly fragrant bits in my $4-bowl. If you prefer those saucy or moist version, this might not be your kind of wanton Mee. And neither will it transport you to the sweet, sour spicy Thai paradise. It's simple and aromatic. Thankfully there were juicy meaty wantons in the soup to counteract the dryness in the bowl. Yes, the noodles clumped together, but I can always separate it with my chopsticks.","243":"Lovely al dente noodles with the right amount of seasoning!!Lapcheong on the sweet side and takeaways come without soup (ask for it). \u00c2\u00a0Very generous portions. Fried wonton slightly tough but the meat is so tasty!!Only downside is the pork lard... A little excessive (ask for just a bit)","244":"Tasty flavors. \u00c2\u00a0Only gripe is the queue and noodles tend to be a very dry and stiff. Can't imagine taking away the noodles back home to eat. :\/Other than that it's fantastic! Come by and order the large $5 bowl. And you can get the burst-full-of- flavor Chinese sausages in your noodles!","245":"I transited in Bangkok a few times this year & have to make a hard choice between my masseuse OR Soi 19 wanton noodle, given the tight schedule. My masseuse always win because she is REALLY good and she is near the skytrain and I have zero-tolerance for traffic jams and dishonest drivers. Today, I HAPPENED to drive through CTE and decided to GPS into the famed Soi 19 wanton noodles birthed at Ang Mo Kio, to get my Thai wanton noodle fix. Boy, was I glad that at 10plus in the morning, there is no queue! \u00c2\u00a0Since I have not had breakfast, I ordered the $5 bowl (#2). It was substantial with 2 fried wontons, 2 wantons in soup, char siew and lup cheong. Fortunately, i was already armed with small dishes of pickled green chilli, chilli flakes, and pork lard. One bite into the noodles : it was sweet! \u00c2\u00a0I know the Thais put lots of sugar in their food BUT wanton noodles are not meant to be sweet. So I doused it with chilli flakes, pickled green chilli & more pork lard. \u00c2\u00a0I wanted to book an airticket to fly to Bangkok right away to have my proper authentic fix. \u00c2\u00a0On my way home, I can't wait to write this review as I am dying of thirst from MSG attack. Yup, I would not take this noodle chain again, even if in the vicinity. It is OK but it fell way below my expectations. It is not Thai wanton noodles. It is Thai Wannabe wanton noodles. I now can understand why SABx2 put up signs to disassociate themselves from the Singapore stall. The Singapore stall should stop using Soi 19. It is a marketing ploy. Actually, I suspect that this stall started out as authentic until they start branching out......","246":"Just recently found this korean BBQ place, i love the place and the food. Beefs selections are vast and love the side dishes.Should try sweet potatoes and kimchi fried rice","247":"Great food. Liked the meat collection. Even better is that soft drinks and ice cream included too!!","248":"Popped by on the second day of Chinese New Year, and we were looking for a Korean barbecue to go to, and we were surprised to find this place open!Reasonably priced, about $30+ per person, for a buffet spread of different meats to grill, and a limited selection of veggies and Banchan. Kimchi here is fresh and tastes quite okay. The quality of the meat here is not amazing, but good enough for the price, and free flow. Service here is pretty attentive and good. The ventilation must be quite good here because I didn't smell terrible after the meal. Yum!","249":"since 1994, les amis has been a pillar in french fine dining. 3 michelin stars do not disappoint from their ala carte, pre-fixe & degustation menus, the wine list menu has expanded so much more compared to when they had 2 michelin stars.chef lepinoy has polished some of the \"signature dishes\" that has been more less fixed & has not changed much since 2017. i do wish they could offer a more varied seasonal menu to change from time to time to offer inspiration & something refreshing eg. an unforgettable all vegetable, herb, fruit palate cleanser. nonetheless, most of the appetisers & main entree's have maintained consistent quality every time, every dish echoes the complex & dense escoffier's french cooking flavors. the best place in singapore is here, baguette, mini crossaint, raisin bread all just light crispy, alittle chewy and so fresh!desserts are always a treat, tonight's coffee ice cream in a sugar sphere was like eating an ice black coffee instead of drinking it, not too sweet but juuust right, the sensation is most intriguing! service is just as polished since 1994, response is fast, staff are attentive, ever so polite & ready to ask any questions. lastly, don't forget your door gift on the way out!","250":"My family came to Les Amis for my dad's birthday celebration while we were in Singapore. The restaurant is conveniently located in Shaw Centre on Orchard Road. It was really difficult making a reservation because I never received a confirmation email after submitting a $200 deposit online. I assumed that it never went through and was not expecting a confirmation on the actual day of the lunch. Luckily, my family had no backup plan and headed to Les Amis.We ordered the $138 prix fixe menu (3 courses + 1 dessert) for all 4 of us and added supplementary fees to upgrade some courses. The chef also surprised us with tons of complimentary items to try. One server even brought over an entire cast iron to show us how the foie gras was cooked. I've never seen anything like it before!The Le Homard Bleu En Salade (supplement $60) was a spin on blue lobster salad with pearls of crunchy watermelon and vegetables. It was so fresh and light. La Noix De Saint-Jacques Aux Herbes, or scallopserved in a creamy sauce, was seasoned well and super flavorful. Since I didn't want any of the proteins on the lunch menu, I specially ordered the dinner steak (supplement $50). It was cooked perfectly at medium-rare with pinkish hints that did not make the meat taste gamy. The three sauces on the side went well with the meat and I thought the poofy potato chips were witty. Lastly, I really liked my La Poire Williams dessert. I didn't expect to see star anise used as an ingredient for desserts, but it really enhanced the flavors of poached pear and caramel cream filling.Overall, my family really enjoyed the entire dining experience at Les Amis. I now understand why this restaurant was awarded two Michelin stars. The staff was super professional and friendly. Every course was an absolute delight with amazing flavors! Additionally, the restaurant also packaged a ton of pound cakes and high-tea snacks for us to take to-go. Highly recommend!","251":"Dining at Les Amis is always a pleasure, from the smooth service to the quality of the cooking. Now, this would not be a two-Michelin-star restaurant in France (where the whole experience would almost certainly be at least one notch better, especially the food and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor), but let's not be nit-picking and be grateful for the opportunity to come here.","252":"Dining at Les Amis is always a pleasure, from the smooth service to the quality of the cooking.

Serves traditional French cuisine. We went there for lunch which was a relatively good price for fine dining (~130\/pax). The courses include: amuse bouche, cold soup, salmon tartare, langoustine, duck and dessert. We find the food overall good but not spectacular, and frankly underwhelming given my high expectations of a Michelin star. The food just felt a bit too safe. Yes, the techniques and quality of ingredients were top-notch but the meal was just lacking in creativity to become particularly memorable. Favorite dishes were the langoustine (fresh \/ simple but really well-cooked) and the baba dessert (not too sweet, rich but balanced)Service was excellent, a true Michelin star level service. Large and good quality wine selection. Sommelier is quite helpful and gives good recommendation on the wine. They also gave us free macaroons to take as souvenir.","254":"Every time I visit Singapore I have to hit at least one Michelin starred restaurants as there are quite a few in the city! This time we picked Les Amis and it didn't disappoint! We did the Tasting Menu which was perfectly executed with every dish revealed to us from a perfectly withdrawn dome - old school French style. We loved the drama as you don't see it much these days. The service was also top-notch as we felt completely doted on by our multitude of servers. The standouts on the menu were the challen duck (cooked perfectly!) and the langoustine with olive oil emulsion - divine! The menu didn't disappoint and if you want an old school fine dining experience while visiting Singapore, Les Amis fills that bill. :)","255":"Les Amis is an exquisite french restaurant on Orchard, serving up French classics in a decadent setting. We went there for lunch, and got the 3 course tasting menu. We started off with a cheese puff bread followed by an amuse bouche of a black and white truffles. Excellent start if I might say so. Next the bread trolley came by, the french are known for the love of bread, and the bread here was top notch. I tried a mini croissant, a bacon bread and a puff pastry roll, along with a french butter with sea salt. Stellar food so far and we hadn't even started with the courses. Next up was a radish foam amuse bouche with a striped bread with truffle and gold leaf. Not the best dish but still great. For the main lunch appetizers, we tried a traditional poached egg surrounded by truffles on a red wine sauce and a lobster encased in a truffle shell, both were exemplary. Next for mains, I got the salmon two ways (lightly seared and as a tartare), while my wife got the pheasant and foie gras served in a tarte. For dessert we got a gran mariner souffle and a pear poached in caramel pastry. Superb food all around. Compliments of the chef, we were also served a exquisite chocolate tart (with no sugar), which was heavenly and an assortment of chocolates to finish. Overall, an excellent dining experience, the service was exemplary and it was totally deserving of 2 michelin stars! Highly recommended!","256":"Exquisite food and service. Not giving them all five stars because it was very difficult for my uncle to go up and down the stairs to access the restroom! I hope there are plans for Les Amis to make the restaurant more disability friendly, especially for their longstanding loyal patrons! On a positive note, I couldn't decide between the five ice cream flavors they had, so I was given all five for my dessert","257":"This is a truly great dining establishment. It well deserves its 2 Michelin stars. I had the Tasting Menu for lunch together with a 1\/2 bottle of burgundy. It started with a selection of breads and French butter, then an amuse-bouche. The next four servings were: (1) cold angel hair pasta with caviar & truffle, (2) langoustine, (3) pan seared duck foie gras, & (4) French river salmon, all followed with the main course of Roasted Duck with spring turnip. Then dessert, of course. The service and ambiance could not be better.","258":"Les Amis, helmed by Chef de cuisine Sebastien Lepinoy, is ranked 12th in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2016. Opened since 1994, they are one of the longest standing fine-dining restaurants in Singapore. During my week-long trip to Singapore in January, I managed to secure a lunch reservation at their establishment.Les Amis offers several dining options with seasonally crafted menus which ranges from 65$+ to $295+. We opted for 'Le Menu Tasting' which showcases 6 dishes for $155 per person. It's comprised of one cold appetizer, two hot appetizers, two main courses and one dessert.Dining at Les Amis was a lovely experience. Their angel hair pasta signature dish was to die for. The whole team takes a lot of pride in their work and I commend them for it. If you're looking for a straightforward contemporary French fine dining experience with a high level of finesse, Les Amis is the place to be.","259":"Located in Shaw Theater, Les Amis is one of the oldest French fine dining in Singapore so it was a must try in our book. We came here for Valentines 2016 and were pleasantly surprised with a simple and sophisticated decor, which we thought was similar to Jean George in New York. We opted for the Le Menu Classic course, reasonably priced at $185\/person. The flavors of the dish, the service, and the atmosphere fell together perfectly (nothing to nitpick about this pl) and we left a happy couple by the end of the night. Will return!

A classic, classy, upscale, quiet, clean, warm, friendly French restaurant. Be warned, they don't really have an \"A La Carte\" menu. They have 3 set menus from $150-$300 and several \"to share\" dishes. We each ordered the $150 \"Decouverte\" menu which included:Steamed Blue Crab and Hokkaido Sea Urchin on Lobster Custard with Fennel Foam - Rich and deliciousCrispy Cornouaille Langoustine, with a mini caesar salad - DeliciousSeasonal Corn Soup with chives - served piping hot with a few caramel corns on the side, rich but balancedHungarian Charcoal-Grilled Pork Rack With Carrots Confit and potato puree - The pork was super tender, the puree impeccable and the carrots delicious. My co-workers opted for Wild Scottish Salmon, one confit and one tartare.Dessert was Dark Chocolate Souffle with Tahiti Vanilla Ice Cream -ice cream was the most vanilla-ee I've ever had.I felt very satisfied with the meal, and felt it was actually good value despite the cost. A special note, they have FOUR kinds of butter and 3 kinds of bread: Baguette, sourdough and focaccia. \u00c2\u00a0The mini baguettes were incredible. The butters are smoked (delicious), seaweed (salty), spicy and salted. I tried each and they were all good in their own way, perhaps the best butters I've ever had. Service was great, they explained each item since I didn't remember what any of the courses were. The wine list is as thick as a dictionary but they have affordable wines and wines by the glass. The restaurant is pretty small and intimate, and their wine cellar is a digital glass walk in safe-room. I will certainly return next time I come to Singapore.","261":"Standard awesome French food. Lost a star for a nit-picky-i-can't-believe-im-such-a-snob kinda way. My gripe was that I called ahead for my fiances bday cake. And it was totally forgotten by the staff. I waited 45 minutes after the end of the meal, because I thought it was still coming until the table next to mine got a cake. Then I said something, but it was too late. We just got an extra dessert with a candle in it. Really disappointing.","262":"Had the degustation menu, for lunch: Lots of techniques, but nothing impressive or memorable. Almost boring :-s Not what I was expecting! \u00c2\u00a0And in fact it's all about the expectations. This place is easily a five star, if compared to all the Singapore restaurants out there. However, when compared to the top restaurants... It fails. \u00c2\u00a0Andre keeps the crown for best restaurant in Singapore for me.","263":"I had the good fortune to get invited by a friend to thisincredible restaurant and just returned. \u00c2\u00a0Restaurants frankly don't get any better than this. \u00c2\u00a0Formal wear is a must and frankly this would be the place to wear the nicest thing you own. \u00c2\u00a0I even busted out a brand new suit for the occasion and was happy that I did so. \u00c2\u00a0The menu was incredible and I will list the various things we tried out. \u00c2\u00a0We didn't exactly stick to the set menu because one of the people I was with has a daughter who works at the restaurant and was frankly showing off all the signature items (and I am soooo happy that she did). \u00c2\u00a0Good lord. \u00c2\u00a0The presentation and explanation of all items was damn impressive and helped me out because several of these items are not on my normal menu :) \u00c2\u00a0Here is a list of items we sampled:STEAMED WHITE ASPARAGUSwhite asparagus from provence, served with a traditional mousseline sauceSPECIAL SELECTION OF KRISTAL CAVIARcold angel hair in harmony with black truffle & caviar balanced with an exquisite aroma of kombu &chivesFOIE GRAS & EELpan seared foie gras and french river eel in combination with citrus fruit compote and dashiJAPANESE OMI BEEFgrilled japanese beef with asparagus and traditional \"poivrade\" sauceBABY LAMBbaby lamb rack from \"luberon\" with ratatouilleDark Chocolate P125 Souffle withTahiti Vanilla CreamALPHONSO MANGOin a sugar sphere with coconut sorbet","264":"the food is decently - and might I say, perhaps technically - perfect, but there was nothing particularly surprisingly or wow-ing; service is efficient if a little intrusive, since they belong to that class where waiters are aloof and almost slightly standoff-ish (how they manouevre around my photo-shooting also tells me a little of their skill); and the restaurant is lovely, if a little too cold (feel rather than absolute temperature).the bread basket arrives with an array of carbs that brought variety rather than any particularly impressive taste - the sugared orange brioche was best. this was followed by a foie gras mousse-type with mackerel and my garlic-spicy gazpacho - small portions but well judged so. our amuse bouche was a deviled egg livened up by plump ikura - perhaps the most surprising dish (though still JUST a deviled egg).two scallops in their shells made up the best part of the meal - seared lovely and topped with soft chopped mushrooms and a lovely jus - and were definitely worth the extra.and our mains of a shrimp-topped pasta and seared beef continued the theme of good-but-not-special - it's all decently done, as the photos show very well, but we still waiting for the oomph (so ephemerally delivered by the scallop course).dessert was a play on mangos - a shortbread base topped with ripe cubes and puree, as well as a thick mango lassi topped with pistachios. pretty good - but there was such a savoriness about the tart that completely defied its status as dessert (and made me have an ice cream later for my sweet tooth).and to finish it all, we were brought a complimentary dish of madeleines and lemon curd - utterly delicious. buttery, crusty, and soft with fine crumbs, these are spectacular specimens of the french confectionary.this is a tempered review if nothing else - I would certainly return, though most likely only if I weren't paying - because I like my food (especially when expensive) to be spectacularly good, or at least interesting. but it well deserves its status as bastion of fine-dining traditions in our tiny country - and would serve your purposes best (if you find them aligned to those of busy businessmen).","265":"This is the quintessential posh and good French restaurant where you have a pay a pretty penny and get amazing food, service and ambience. It is definitely a great choice for a special dinner if you want to impress. There is nothing you can really fault their food (all cooked and flavored to perfection) and their service (attentive but not intrusive nor condescending) for. They only do set menus here so it is quite pricey for dinner but they have a more reasonably priced lunch menu (Saturdays included!), so it is possible to try some of their yummilicious food without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!","266":"A great place for lunch and for Singapore the wine prices are quite reasonable.I've never been disappointed with the food or the service and it's definitely a favorite spot I can always rely on for a great meal.","267":"I had a really good meal here; service was impeccable and food was delish but it felt a little overrated and the ambience was not the best. Enjoyed myself but not sure i'd come back","268":"If you really love mushroom, steamboat and\/or are vegetarian, this place is perfect. There are about 20 kinds of mushrooms you can order, plus all the usual meat, seafood, veggies, tofu and more. They also do half-half steamboats which is great if you're dining with friends who love meat more than they do mushrooms. Set Meals come at about $9.80, and if you come on Ladies Night (Wednesday) you get 20% off the buffet. The service is great too. I went there with my family and they hardly showed any annoyance that we came in close to closing time. In fact, they seemed more than happy to accommodate us. The location is good too; you can go \u00c2\u00a0for a nice riverside walk after you're done with dinner if you go there at night. And you'll probably need it after the copious amount of food you'll have consumed. If it was a little cheaper, I'd be there all the time! For the hot pot buffet you'll pay about $30++ per person, but there are plenty of discounts (Citibank) and promotions that take a significant portion of that sum off your bill. Weekends promotions: Sat - Sun (3-5pm): $16.90++ \/person Call for reservations first! And the Birthday Month promotions:Show your IC during your birthday month and get 25% off dinner hotpot buffet.","269":"Mushroom Pot sells a variety of mushroom dishes and a variety of ci zar dishes. I tried their mushroom nabe pot and it was delicious. I love mushrooms so the variety of mushrooms is like wow. We had their salted egg corn dish which was something interested.. the salted egg yolk makes a nice coat around the sweetness of the corn. Eat it with rice and its delicious. Also tried to their drunken chicken which was something quite refreshing. They also have a lunch and dinner buffet going on but you will have to ask the waiter for details.. we didn't have the buffet because we didn't want to eat too much so we ordered a la carte.","270":"The mushroom stock in the steamboat is probably the magic ingredient that keeps people coming back. The steamboat set at $27++ was fair with choices of seafood, beef, pork or combination. A buffet menu is also available. Not impressed with the fried monkey head mushroom which was recommended by the waiter.","271":"In the back of my mind La Ristrettos has always been just another cute hipster cafe. But they've upped their game with their pancake offerings!Savory pancakes ($11) - 5 starsMy first-world brunch problem has always been \"I really want the pancakes\/French toast with caramelized bananas and ice cream but I'll feel sick after a few bites and wish I ordered something savory.\" La Ristrettos solves this with their savory pancakes: two huge pancakes with a mass of scrambled eggs and bacon with a side of maple syrup. I asked if I could substitute the bacon for some sort of vegetable and the lady kindly offered spinach. The cherry (cheese) on top was that they cooked the spinach and garnished it with a dollop of ricotta. I suppose from bad experiences elsewhere I was expecting them to say no, or just give me a few token raw greens, so this was such a pleasant surprise. The scrambled eggs were creamy and substantial and the pancakes were gigantic and fluffy! These were the pancakes I'd expected Clinton St to have, and that I've been looking for! No more $20 tiny pancakes thank you.They also offer sweet pancakes with vanilla gelato and salted caramel that I'm going to have to come back to try.","272":"Crabmeat linguini pasta ($15) - 3 stars. Nothing special.Five stars for the ambience though!","273":"I walked past quite a few times as my dentist is located on this floor and if it wouldn't be for Yelp I would have continued walking by. But the Yelper in me says that a place hidden in a corner with tons of positive reviews must be good and indeed, it is!I am not a big coffee connoisseur, I am more of your average Starbucks girl but this latte was good! I really enjoyed the aroma of the coffee. I also had an egg toast with avocado and that was pretty decent too. Next time I have to go to the dentist I will make some extra time to have another cuppa and some food!","274":"Great little cafe tucked away in a medical center. Good selection of caffeine beverages and tea, but only a few dessert items offered. The reason they do not have decaffeinated coffee is because they only serve their own in-house roasted beans and am not interested in the complicated decaffeination process. There is food too, mainly pasta. Indoor and outdoor seatings. Relaxing atmosphere with nice music (inside) and if you like the sound of iron beams being jack hammered into place, you can sit outside (until the hotel is completed, that is).","275":"The coffee here was great. \u00c2\u00a0I had an iced latte and an espresso on my visit. \u00c2\u00a0I also had the crab cake breakfast which was delicious and filling. \u00c2\u00a0The rest of the menu looked good and also like there are daily specials. \u00c2\u00a0I went at around 9 am on a weekday and it was not crowded, so the crowds are probably at lunch. \u00c2\u00a0The register is just inside the door, so a line in the hall might make it look more busy than it really is, but there is ample seating in the neighboring courtyard. \u00c2\u00a0On the 8th floor of the medical building (a little hard to find) but worth the trip.","276":"In the Square 2 shopping mall, take the lift, next to Old Town Coffee to level 8. Turn left and walk down, till you see the cafe, which is surrounded by medical centres. In the early morning when I visited the cafe, it was the only one that was opened. Dimly lighted, the place gave a cozy feel. There was not much of a crowd, just 2 couples around. Only cash and NETS was accepted here.Flat White (S$5)An Australian origin, similar to a caffe latte and is distinguished by thinner froth on top. The drink was served in a cup with no holder. The drink was rich and thick.Breakfast Crab Cake ($15)Potatoes, Pancetto, Avocados, Poached Egg, Wild RocketsThe crab cake tasted a tab fishy, but quite meaty. Interesting the potatoes was presented like a mashed potato patty.Pear Tart ($8)Baked pear tart with vanilla gelatoThe serving was bigger than expected, about the size of a small pan. The tart smelt quite delicious when served. The crust was light and crispy, and sliced through easily. As it was served hot, the gelato melt rather easily. Overall the food was not bad and the place was quite relaxing.","277":"good service and great coffee. nice meals. \u00c2\u00a0just a bit hard to find. \u00c2\u00a0once you find the Novena Medical office it's on the 8th floor","278":"I'll admit: I'm quite picky about my coffee. And while I usually complain about the standard of coffee in cafes around Singapore, I also frown at the hefty price tags many popular coffee establishments place on my favourite caffeinated drink. I found out about this gem of a place by some chance encounter some years back and I remember being pleasantly surprised by how a cafe that actually got its coffee right was able to keep itself hidden in a little corner of a medical centre. While I feared that it would eventually close due to a lack of awareness from the community, I'm glad that it's not only doing well, but also getting a lot of positive attention (which it fully deserves) in recent years. The ambience here is classy. Very nicely spruced up decor - if the indoor seating gets a little too cramped, the outdoor area has plenty of sitting space too. The food here is a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth giving a shot. The coffee, however, is where it shines. Definitely one of my favourite coffee haunts in central Singapore.","279":"The good atmosphere! I study at the cafe during the whole morning. I would suggest you to have a good day there. Plus, the tea was quite excellent.","280":"It's places like La Ristrettos that make me thankful that I Yelp.Why do I say that? First of all, the chances of finding this place is pretty low. It's in the most random location ever- the 8th floor of the fairly new Novena Medical Center. There are no advertisements around Square 2 or anywhere else around the medical center (at least, that I've noticed) so unless you have a doctor's appointment on the 8th floor, you'll never know this place even existed! But thanks to Yelp, you are now cooler and better person. :)I loved the ambiance of this place. It's quite cozy, with cute, vintage coffee signs on the walls. They have high-tech machines that make badass brews. The free pitchers of ice water with orange slices was a nice touch. They were also playing some classic Frank Sinatra while I was there, which put me in an even better mood. I wanted to have breakfast, but most of their breakfast offerings seemed too heavy for me. They had dishes like croissants and frittatas, but they all come with salads, which I simply wasn't in the mood for. (Also, who has salads for breakfast?!) I did see some smaller offerings in their counter, but it wasn't well labelled and I didn't feel like asking about them. I ended up settling for a banana and a cappuccino. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so all I can say is that I did enjoy my cappuccino and I thought it was fairly priced at $5. Bottom line, my first visit was a success. If they could offer smaller bakery items and free wifi, they would really win me over. If you have time before your medical appointment, or even if you're just hanging around the Square 2\/Velocity\/Tan Tock Seng area and you're craving an upscale coffee experience, ignore Starbucks and give La Ristrettos a try.","281":"A hidden place in Novena. Very good coffee and good brunch\/breakfast. Dont know why the opening time is so limited during weekend. It is only opened on Sat morning (til 2pm) during weekend...","282":"Wasn't able to try their pasta mains as they're only available after 12pm (was there ard 11am) so I opted for the Tostini (roasted chicken breast, spinach, tomato and a poached egg on top sourdough bread accompanied with honey mustard sauce) - was average, nothing specky except I really liked the honey mustard sauce and egg was poached perfectly. Mum's choice was heaps better (I had secretly wanted to prefer that but wouldn't make sense for both of us to have the same mains). She had the New breakfast #1 (smoked duck breast on a bed of peas with potato croquettes and poached egg accompanied with honey mustard sauce) - it was yummm!! You can be sure you'll get a good cuppa coffee here and the barista takes so much pride in preparing your cuppa with cool latte art! Had a Piccolo latte and Americano and left us happy as punch :)I'll definitely return to try their pasta and for their coffee.","283":"La Ristrettos is hidden on the 8th floor of Novena Medical Centre. If you haven't been here, you probably wouldn't know that this cafe existed. This building is directly connected to Novena MRT Station and it's very easy to find (just take the exit towards square 2). Not to worry, there are lots of parking lots in this building.It's a small and quiet cafe. Since this place is so secluded, there aren't a lot of customers especially during weekdays. This cafe is probably catered towards providing a nice and cozy environment for surgeons to take a break from their hectic schedules or to discuss some work over a nice cup of coffee. 3G reception is poor here, fortunately they provide free WiFi.They is a big table placed in the centre (that can probably fit 10 people) and a long table top (with red plastic chairs) facing the garden.The interior is filled with wooden furniture, with fake bricks embedded onto the walls. Outdoor seats are also available in the garden for you to breathe in some fresh air. Besides, this cafe is tax-free - you could save a couple of bucks!I ordered their Macchiato ($3.50). The coffee is smooth and tastes great. Could have been much better with some caramel to sweeten things up! I later found out that they are the sole distributor of Caffe Agust Beans which is an Italian coffee brand that is organic and certified 100% Fairtrade.I love the presentation of the food here! Food is served in brightly coloured dishes on a nice wooden tray. I tried their Grande breakfast set ($14.00). You have 3 choices for the egg (either poached, scrambled or sunny side). Served together with mushrooms, sausage, salad and 2 slices of sourdough. Sausage and salad dressing was good. However, bacon was burnt and quite tough. Poached eggs were a disappointment - it's overcooked!For coffee lovers, this is the place to go. Food is satisfactory, not good enough to keep me coming back. As for me, I think I'll only come back for their coffee, provided I'm around the area.Signing Off,Zhan HaoFounder of TheCafection","284":"La Ristrettos is hidden away on the 8th floor of the Novena Medical Center. \u00c2\u00a0Sure, there is a sign by the entrance to the elevator lobby but without actively seeking out the spot or unless you happen to be a patient on the 8th floor, you would never find this place, which would be your loss. \u00c2\u00a0La Ristrettos serves some excellent coffee and food, which would put the other coffee places in Novena to shame. \u00c2\u00a0Start with the coffee and the name sake - ristretto. \u00c2\u00a0They actually have a ristretto pulled espresso on the menu! \u00c2\u00a0Sure, you can ask a barrista to use less water, but here it's a given. \u00c2\u00a0But their lattes and cappuccinos are also really good - love the strong coffee against a creamy backdrop. \u00c2\u00a0But the surprise would have to be the breakfast sandwiches. \u00c2\u00a0I had the one with eggs and pancetta, and it was delicious! \u00c2\u00a0Yes it's a little pricey at $11 but totally worth it. \u00c2\u00a0 By using pancetta, I didn't get that nasty surprise - turkey bacon. \u00c2\u00a0And the bread was amazing - a little hard on the outside but chewy, I would have loved to take a few and use them for a proper Philly cheesesteak. \u00c2\u00a0Service may be a little slow, but it's really worth the wait for the hand crafted coffee drinks and food. \u00c2\u00a0Plus the view of a secret garden is so peaceful, you hardly notice.","285":"Coffee here is on point! Brunch is great, my favourite on their menu is the crab cake. Smoothies are also delicious, banana chocolate is a must try. Friendly staff and lovely ambience. Outdoor seating in the garden is really refreshing.","286":"\"I need coffee so badly\"\"Quick! I'll take you to the hospital\"Well, that's not quite the reaction I was imagining when needing a coffee on a recent trip to Singapore. I mean, I know I'm a caffeine addict but a visit to the hospital? Really?Turns out there's a cafe serving good coffee in amongst the long and hidden corridors of the Novena Medical Centre. You'll ride the lift with people heading off to see there acupuncturist, gynaecologist, \u00c2\u00a0allergist, neurologist, dermatologist... and you'll feel both smug and shameful all at the same time because you're heading off to see Doctor Coffee and have no ailments at all, except for a terrible addiction.","287":"Hidden in the crevice of Novena Medical Center, this place is a real gem if you happen to be in the area. There is limited seating inside, but there is a whole garden outside for you to explore! Why stay indoors! Zen out sipping on your espresso while watching leaves drop into the little pond in the center of the garden. If you're looking for coffee that is bold and strong. You've found the right place. To all you third wave coffee lovers out there, you're going to be disappointed if you were looking for something fruity and juicy. *Free wifi available.","288":"A self proclaimed coffee specialist that does not serve pourovers. The girl at the teller didn't know what a pourover is either. FAIL.Other than that, the piccolo latte I had was nicely done. The indoor seating area does cloy up with the smells from the kitchens. I elected to sit outdoors in the courtyard. \u00c2\u00a0The courtyard is a great venue.","289":"Excellent artisan coffees made by expert baristas who take their job seriously. Above average Food is decent, but probably not the main attraction here. The chicken cotaletta sandwich is fresh and well made. The main let down is speed of service in which they sometimes can be overwhelmed during weekends.","290":"What an oasis. Sure, you have to go into a medical building to get there, but once you arrive, you're transported to a little bit of coffee heaven. Give yourself some time since everything is freshly made. And while the interior is fun, I loved sitting in the quiet garden outside.","291":"Novena medical centre is exactly as you would expect - unremarkable corridors lined with doctors offices, waiting rooms, more doctors offices, yet more waiting rooms, and in the midst of all this, an unexpected outlier - a small and cosy Italian style cafe, serving up interesting ristretto shots. The inside is quite small and cosy, but the limited space is put to good use. A communal table lies in the centre of the room, flanked by counter seats, and a door that leads to a shaded outdoor seating area. Tampers and espresso shot cups line the shelves, while the staff pull shots at an open bar counter lined with espresso machines and grinders. I like the concept - it's always interesting to see the baristas at work, and for coffee geeks, to see the shots themselves being pulled. This can tell you a lot about the quality of coffee at a cafe - a spaghetti strand sized column of dark black liquid slowly lining a shot cup is a sign of good underlying espresso, while a 10 second downpour of pale brown liquid is a hint that you should quietly slip out the entrance without waiting for your drink. Fortunately, La Ristretto's shots were good examples of the former, with a 20 second extraction of potent espresso. \u00c2\u00a0The espresso shot had a medium brown crema, and a robust, full bodied flavour with distinct hints of chocolate. It was bright without being bitter, and potent without being burnt. The shot glass of water on the side is a nice touch also, and was used, as the serving size is a little larger than usual for a single shot. The coffee beans used were from Agust coffee roasters in Italy, which I haven't come across in Asia before, and are quite distinct in their own right. It's also interesting to be able to sample a robust Italian style espresso, which contrasts with the trend for citrusy single origin shots that are on offer in a number of cafes at present. The latte that I ordered had smooth foam, and a large serving size. It was quite mild, but the underlying espresso shot was muted rather than being completely lost, and could easily be detected in the aftertaste. \u00c2\u00a0This may be the result of the larger espresso shot sizes mentioned earlier. The overall character was of coffee rather than milk, so despite the serving size, it avoids the easy mistake of serving warm caffeinated warm milk, rather than coffee. The foam maintained it's integrity throughout, without breaking up - a small detail, but one that's consistent with correct steaming temperature and duration, and something that I've seen a few cafes get wrong in recent weeks.There is a good coffee menu on offer, with the usual combinations of espresso and milk, and brewed coffees. One thing that differs is the presence of shakerato on the menu (a shaken cold espresso), that I have not seen before, and something that I'm genuinely curious to see made. Prices were as expected, at 8.50 for the latte and espresso above.Overall, La Ristretto's is interesting in that they are serving something genuinely different, and it's an opportunity to try a fairly authentic Italian espresso. The location may be an issue for some, in that it's in the middle of a medical centre, rather than in a standalone cafe. This should not deter you from visiting during non peak hours however, especially if you happen to be in the area. However do bear in mind that the cafe itself is quite small, so please let patients and staff take priority!","292":"Excellent coffee place, sadly in a very hidden location. You need to take up the elevator to the 8th floor and then walk past a couple of medical suites to get to this gem. It's a small but lovely place in the otherwise sterile environment of the medical center. Good strong and bold coffee with creamy milk.","293":"Nice hidden gem in what feels like a sterile hospital. Randomly found it while looking for our gp,i had thr mango\/strawberry and it was amazing. The cafe is small but the decor is nice. We didnt have time to try the food but the wife said the coffee was amazing as well (beans are from Italy).","294":"Asiago bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar!! Something so simple yet so delightful was the right way to set the stage for ITALIAN dining!Several tables ordered the lobster linguine, which usually comes in a big shared bowl. Although the \"tomato sauce\" sounded simplistic, it was some of the best I've tasted, and there were hearty chunks of lobster throughout the pasta. The lobster comes with the full shell and claws, so it might look intimidating at first, but actually most of the meat has already been cooked in with the pasta. The durian tiramisu was really worth it -- delicate flavors of Mao Shan Wang (\u00e7\u008c\u00ab\u00e5\u00b1\u00b1\u00e7\u008e\u008b) durian fibers interlaced with marscapone that didn't overpower the cocoa and coffee flavors -- how did the dessert chef do it?! \u00c2\u00a0I myself don't particularly enjoy durian normally, but this dessert had me going back scooping for more. Light yet still pervasive durian flavors that I never thought would pair with tiramisu -- EPIC dessert!","295":"Very delicious lobster spaghetti and the lobster meat is very generous. Good for 2-3 people to share. The seasonable durian tiramisu is uniquely singapore and it is very very good. The Mao Shang Wang durian does not over power the tiramisu and the sweetness is just right. Hurry before the durian season is over. Best grilled pork too!","296":"In short, Mimmo has nailed it. Excellent everything. Pizza is an absolute bullseye and should put the neighbouring (and well below average) Sarpino's out of a job. Quite possibly the largest glass of wine in Singapore, and better than drinkable ($9 per glass). Buckle up: you can buy their massive and delicious bread loaves FLOWN IN FROM ITALY (why ask why?) for 7 bucks a loaf and get that freshly baked \"niam!\" It has been 3 years since I've enjoyed an Italian this much in SG, and that it is 500m from my front door, well, I'm just singin' in the rain. Badaboom. Coming back very soon. Bravo.","297":"Parking is now available at the residence \"The Venues\", right opposite the restaurant. Either that, or hope you get street parking right outside the restaurant. (Can be difficult during peak periods, so just park elsewhere and walk if possible)The parents wanted to get Turtle Soup for dinner, and while I'm not a huge fan (still sounds creepy to me), I love their Black Chicken soup! So herbal-y and flavourful, yum!They basically only serve two types of soups with rice (yam or white), so you find anything else here.Their chili is really good. Add vinegar to it for that extra kick.","298":"The thought of eating turtle may be somewhat controversial or grotesque to some, but this was probably the best thing I ate the entire week I was in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Ser Seng Herbs sells other things like black chicken (was so tempted to get), but their turtle soups are where it's at.You can choose between $15\/$25\/$35 bowls of soup, and you can also choose whether or not you would like to include turtle innards along with the skin and meat. \u00c2\u00a0I chose to keep all three in my $25 soup for the full experience, and I was not disappointed whatsoever. \u00c2\u00a0The meat was tender and the texture reminded me of pork. \u00c2\u00a0Turtle doesn't taste fishy as I thought it would, but more like a typical red meat. \u00c2\u00a0The skin is gelatinous and tastes like cartilage. \u00c2\u00a0Innards are awesome, but that's because I'm biased and love innards\/entrails. \u00c2\u00a0Comes with a side of special hot sauce (add vinegar - good combo). \u00c2\u00a0The hot soup was probably the most flavorful soup I've ever had in my life. \u00c2\u00a0I don't care if its 90 degrees Fahrenheit and 100% humidity outside... good soup is acceptable in any kind of weather.The next time I'm in Singapore, this is my first stop.","299":"For the adventurous gourmet who wouldn't mine gulping down a thick rich creamy essence of Turtle. Set Seng has the best tasting soup I have tasted in Asia.The turtles are farmed for human consumption in Indonesia, which supplies the produce to them. The soup is absolutely delicious and it is definitely worth a try without any prejudice. The texture of the meat taste like lean chicken.","300":"Had to ask a taxi driver who then told us about this gem on McPherson. \u00c2\u00a0Soup was delicious, rich, lots of turtle. \u00c2\u00a0Also quite clean...had a A rating.","301":"Death by chocolate cake ($12++) - 3 starsThe cake was on the dry side (mitigated by the ice cream) and the frosting was too sweet but it was overall decent. The ice cream tasted pretty regular, nothing amazing. Without the frosting it wasn't too sweet. Satisfies a craving.Service - 5 stars","302":"Pan fried snapper ($26++ = $31) - 3 starsSmall portion, and the \"creamed kale\" turned out to be one kale leaf... when I asked they said the \"kale is in the sauce.\" Snapper was cooked excellently but then ended up being too salty at the end.Service was also really slow, it took our food a good 20-30 min to arrive. We sat by the window and be aware it smells like manure. However it was a cool night and overall very pleasant and the waiters and waitresses were very accommodating and friendly!We paid $15 each using the Entertainer app so I can't complain.","303":"The sausage (two tiny sausage patties) with creme fraiche eggs (3 stars) were alright. Go for the ambience (4 stars).","304":"Good food. Nice ambience. The service staff are efficient, informative and accommodating. The food is a decent standard - value for money. Hope they will have more variety in the choices of food available for after Brunch Hours. Place is ideal for a private event.","305":"We went to Riders on a Saturday for brunch and it was packed. We overheard the staff saying that the waiting time was about half an hour. Fortunately, we'd made a reservation, so we practically sailed right past the waiting line. I like the atmosphere of the cafe. It was open, inviting and bustling with activity. Perfect place for people-watching. We were seated on the balcony facing the stables. My initial concern was about the smell, but it was unnoticeable. We had the corned beef croquettes, Riders Burger, and homemade sausages with creme fraiche scrambled eggs. The croquettes were good - the crispy, golden brown breadcrumbs gave way to creamy potatoes with the occasional chewy beef bits. The corned beef offered a pleasant pop of flavour that accented the mild potato taste. They were truly enjoyable to eat. The portion was generous too. I expected maybe two pieces of croquettes but there were four - more than enough for a starter. The Riders Burger was all about the beef. The other ingredients were reminciscent of Burger King's Western Whopper, but they were all overwhelmed by the beef. This burger would be perfect for meat lovers.I chose the homemade sausages and creme fraiche scrambled eggs because they came with a leek and potato rosti. Unfortunately they looked better than they tasted. The hollandaise sauce was the best part of the dish. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy, but for the most part tasteless, but that was ok as we had salt and pepper at our table. The rosti was, strangely, creamy. It was essentially fried mashed potato and leek. There was a mild taste of leek on the fried surface, but that was overpowered by the flavourless mush that was underneath. Next to the mild flavours of the eggs and mush, the sausage tasted too strong, which shocks the taste buds. I dipped most of what I could in the hollandaise to get some flavour, but there was barely a spoonful of it to begin with. The food may have been slightly disappointing, but the service was excellent. The crew was attentive and proactive, and we could really tell that they were properly trained to provide high-level service. For that, kudos to the staff AND the owner\/management of Riders Cafe for caring. Service really contributes half, if not more, to customer experience and satisfaction. For this, I would definitely go back to Riders (and order other things on the menu instead).","306":"It is definitely advisable to make reservations at least 1 day in advance (they don't take same day booking) as it is still full house at Riders Cafe on weekends. They do take walk in customers but likely you just have to wait for at least 30 minutes or more. It is not so bad as you get to gaze at the lush greenery, clear blue sky (if it is not raining) and listen to the neighing and clopping of horses every time they are led back into the stables. Quite enjoyable as it is not a common sight in this concrete jungle.Being my 2nd visit in a span of a few years, I am glad the food is still as good. We shared the pacific benedict and brioche french toast with bananas. They were excellent. Quite a generous serving of swimmer crab meat with nicely poached eggs and spinach and shrimp hollandaise (couldn't taste the shrimp) sauce. Something different from the usual egg benedict or eggs royale. The soft brioche made a perfect french toast. Loved the grilled banana caramelized with a thin layer of sugar, crispy bacon and maple syrup. The cafe mocha was also decent. Being a full house, service was a bit slow but not as bad as some places. There is no air conditioning throughout, except for the washrooms below stairs, adding to the charm of a rustic setting with fresh air coming in through the verandah. Note: You need a car or taxi to get to the restaurant.","307":"Fantastic location and used to be perfect for breakfast, but unfortunately menu recently changed and now overly sugared and fussy for my taste. Could be great again if they bring the old menu back.","308":"One of my favorite brunch places in Singapore! I always have trouble deciding between the crab omelet and the Blackstone Benedict, but the best part of the meal: the molten lava chocolate cake. Rather indulgent for breakfast, but it's worth it! I especially love being able to enjoy brunch while watching the horses.","309":"Riders Cafe is one of the earlier brunch spots which was so popular that reservations have to be placed in advance. Fortunately and coincidentally, there was a table cancellation when I called on the previous day of visit and so we did not have much problems securing seats. The usual brunch suspects were delicious and certainly lived up to the predominantly positive comments that were aplenty in the media or online community. Brioche French Toast with Fresh Berries and Vanilla Mascarpone $14 are great for those who like to start the day on a sweet note. The alternative french toast option comes with maple butter, smoked bacon and burnt bananas. Unlike \"The Usual\" ($16), Black stone Benedict ($15) comes with the extra hollandaise sauce on poached eggs and crispy bacon instead of bangers and mushrooms.To me, hollandaise sauce is the supporting cast that makes the leading cast (soft poached eggs with bursting egg yolk) shine. I had been tempted all along to challenge the Death by Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice cream $12 but I was disillusioned eventually. This won by quantity and not quality. The chocolate ganache was not velvety and stood unmoving like a rubbery coating. There was not much contrast in the taste because everything from the cake to the ice cream was cloyingly sweet. Instead, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake with Crumbled Honeycomb $8 would attract one to take a second bite or even more. The cheesecake itself tasted as natural as it could get, without too much sugar added. Would be ideal if there is more of the salted caramel frosting. Special items of the day are written on the black board. Even though many other brunch spots and cafe have sprouted incessantly in Singapore, Riders Cafe is a good option for brunch or even dinner with the accompaniment of horses. But the location is only convenient if you can find your way there in a car or by a taxi.","310":"Reservation is essential for brunch, especially on weekends, if you do not want to be turned away in disappointment. Nice ambiance for couples and families for a morning of chill and relax. Travelling in is a problem, though. Would be great if you have your own transportation.Food is very good for such a hipster location. Really loved their french toasts and big breakfast, quality of food matches up to its aesthetics. Dinner crowd is significantly smaller than its brunch's, superb for couples who value some quiet time.Outside of norm must trys: french toast with caramelised banana and bacon (brunch), and seafood risotto (dinner).","311":"We alighted at a bus stop at Dunearn Road and then walked in from Eng Neo Avenue. Poor people like need to take public transport. :( As we don't drive, we had to walk in and it is a LONG journey. The road aren't exactly people friendly. I suggest people who are going there to drive in.The place is located beside ranches and you can probably see some horses outside the window.The decor is nicely decorated and place looks cozy for a lovely afternoon brunch. I suggest you can try this. PACIFIC BENEDICT WITH SWIMMER CRAB, POACHED EGGS,SPINACH AND SHRIMP HOLLANDAISE.Theres a pleasant surprise underneath the eggs. You can see huge chunks of crab meat. yum yum.","312":"I haven't really explored many brunch spots in Singapore. But from those that I have visited so far, Riders Cafe is my favorite. We tried to get a reservation the day before and was told that they were fully booked. They would still accept walk-ins though, and that's what we did. We had to wait for about 30 minutes for our table. Not too bad, considering you can wait in the car until they call you.I had the poached egg, portobello, sweet corn polenta and it was cooked very nicely. It's a very simple dish but the execution was very good. Another dish that we had was the almond-granola crusted fried chicken. I think the crispness of the almond & granola matches very well as a batter for the fried chicken. I must note that they also served the corn polenta in this dish, too repetitive IMO.We also ordered the roasted pork belly and it was the letdown of the meal. It was such a sin to cook a pork that way. The skin was hard and not crispy and the meat was just dried out.I'll definitely go to Riders Cafe to try the other items in their menu again though. I heard that their dinner menu is also good and that's another reason to come back.","313":"Love the chocolate lava cake! The eggs benedict is great too. My friends and I really enjoy the pleasant setting on a Saturday or Sunday morning - if you like horses, it's a plus too. Remember to call ahead to make your reservation, as it can get quite busy.","314":"We went for lunch to rider's cafe on a day when the weather was amazing - very pleasant, not too sunny. The ambiance is very laid back and nice. Food for us was ok, nothing spectacular. We did like our milkshakes and juices though. \u00c2\u00a0We had scrambled eggs, chicken blt, beef burger and pasta.","315":"The Riders Cafe is decidedly one of my favourite brunch places in Singapore. You don't get too many awesome poached eggs around here (or maybe I just haven't tried enough), but they do it pretty good here. Coffee's also good, and being in the middle of nowhere is fantastic. It's a great way to get away from the skyscrapers and clogged roads that characterises much of Singapore these days. Smell a bit of green grass, smell a bit of horses.. it's very therapeutic. If you've eaten too much of it's good food, you can always loiter around afterwards and explore a bit. A very nice way to spend a morning. The only gripe I have is that it's extremely inaccessible. Even if you are up for a bit of a trek. It's quite impossible to walk in from Dunearn Road, or I haven't found a way yet! Then again, it's a small price to pay for the wholesome experience.Oh and I never never manage to squeeze in a reservation for weekend brunch unless I call at least a week in advance.","316":"Choose this place for friend's meet up suggested by my friend. This place is only accessible by car so we took a cab in. We went there around noon time without any booking made. As expected, we need to wait to be seated. Waiting time was 45mins and since we are already there, there is no reason why we don't wait. Located at the Bukit Timah Saddle Club, we take the chance to walk around the place enjoying the scenic around us. On and off, someone will ride a horse pass you.We were seated and served. service was good where service crew introduced the different dishes to us. The food was passable but on a hot day without wind can be quite unbearable for people who can't tolerate warm like my friend. We still managed to sit there for 2hr of chit chatting without the crew any hint to suggest us to leave. Definitely a good place to gather for meetup. If you come in by cab, most probably, you will need to call a cab out again. Very inaccessible.","317":"The location is great and the burger was really delicious. Simple but nice fries. Good coffee. The only issue with this place is you have to drive or take a taxi. Friendly staff, good crowd. Will come back again","318":"One of the best places to head to for a good breakfast\/ brunch on the weekends!The place is non air-conditioned, but pretty well-ventilated with the in-house ceiling fans and outdoor natural wind (and lots of sun in the morning!) The best spots to dine at are the few tables on the side of the cafe that overlooks the stable. (Check out the pictures I've uploaded!) For breakfast, meals are usually accompanied with eggs that you can have it your own style: poach, scramble or omelette. The waiting line during the weekends is pretty long. So, make sure you call up the cafe to make reservations before heading down. Getting there is another obstacle. The nearest bus stop is a good 15- 20 mins walk away. I would suggest driving \u00c2\u00a0or cabbing in. \u00c2\u00a0But hey, I assure you the experience, food and service is worth the all the trouble! (especially to wake up early on an early Saturday morning just to have brekkie!)","319":"Rider's is on the favourites list of many brunch-goers, which is why if you plan to have a brunch date here on weekends, you better plan well ahead because its hard to get a seat if you didn't make reservations. Fairways Drive is not a place you want to go to if you don't drive, if you're taking a cab, you'll have to direct the cab driver because not many are familiar with the place. But even with its remote accessibility, its still packed! Because the food and ambience are something you'd travel for, they're that good.To me, they have the best pancakes! Fluffy, buttery, creamy goodness with fresh blueberries and cream. Their poached eggs and salmon comes a close second. Plus enjoying it in a cosy setting against the greenery with horses grazing in the background doesn't hurt!You can take a walk outside and maybe have your kids go on a pony ride (only $10!) after brunch, its not just a nice romantic brunch place but good for families too.Final verdict: One of the most quaint brunch places in Singapore in one of the last countryside corners of this urban jungle.","320":"Riders Cafe is a lovely quiet cafe with alfresco dining available. Was there for dinner, and thought it a great place to chill out over a nice dinner.Food: A better option than Marmalade Pantry @ The Stables. The pork chops were absolutely delicious, and so was the Chilean cod. Really liked the lavender creme brulee, and the chocolate cake is to-die-for.Ambience: Quite a nice chill out joint for dinner, one can opt to sit alfresco if the weather is cool. There's no aircon, so if you're not one to tolerate heat and humidity, highly suggested you go in the evening. Slight pong of horse manure, but not overwhelming and one gets only very faint whiffs now and then.Service: Generally friendly and polite, but seemed a bit lost.Only reason I wouldn't recommend this place is 'cos I wanna keep the crowds away.","321":"NAAAAYYYYYYYYY. That was me imitating horses.This riders caf\u00c3\u00a9 is a little bit atas, you can't deny it. It's not every restaurant that can have horses at their backyard. Okay, not exactly backyard, it's the Bukit Timah Saddle Club. That said, it's a great selling point. You get to see horses galloping by and reconcile the Black Beauty part of you.They serve you jars of water the moment you sit down (WOOTS), service is prompt. Go early and try the egg dishes from their breakfast menu, couple good choices are poached eggs or baked eggs. Their Death by Chocolate Cake is a must-try dessert. OMNOMSNOMSNOMS.The al fresco atmosphere was very wind-in-my-hair, especially on Sunday mornings. It's been a while since I went there, not sure how it's like in the recent heatwave though. Be sure to make bookings in advance, now that everyone knows about this caf\u00c3\u00a9 with horses in the backyard.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.","322":"Where else can you watch ponies trot by as you enjoy brunch? In a lovely little cottage-like house with wooden beams and everything else that makes it feel like a modern ranch, Riders cafe is as laid back as brunching can get. If you take a sanity leave day from work, this is where you should come to get away from it all. Eggs benedict, smoked salmon and pancakes next to horses, the world might be alright again.It's a little out of the way, best if you drive, or else it might be a pain getting in and home.","323":"A non-airconditioned place which is great for brunch. Do get there by car\/taxi though, as it is relatively unaccessible otherwise. I love the lush greenery this place is set in, and how it is housed near horse stables. The eggs benedict here with salmon is pretty good - \u00c2\u00a0the portions were not that generous but sufficient. Do remember to make reservations if you want your date to be impressed.","324":"One of my favorite brunch places because of the excellent food and view they have, I am quite sad to find that more and more people know about this place. That's because then it gets really crowded and the quality of the food\/service might be affected as well. However, barring that, yes I would recommend this place since I last had it because their brunch was really delicious. It was wholesome, yummy eggs and sausages with the usual other sides. An iced coffee while watching some horses gallop by is nice as well.Prices were also reasonable if I don't recall wrongly.Getting there however will require a car. Otherwise it is too much of a hassle to travel in and out of the place. Reservations are definitely required because it is super popular with the expats and locals alike.","325":"Very kids friendly and excellent brunch menu. \u00c2\u00a0It is a popular place on the weekends - the ambience is nice - old black and White House. \u00c2\u00a0The highlight is the weekend pony rides at S$10 \/ person. \u00c2\u00a0A place recommended with small or big group. \u00c2\u00a0Book ahead.","326":"Excluded location tucked away in Fairway Drive near the Singapore Turf Club. Rocked up on a Saturday for brunch one weekend. I didn't have a booking, and Im not too sure if they take brunch bookings, though had to wait for a wee bit to get a table on the verandah. No air con in this place, though they have done well to make sure it quite comfortable and airy. Straight forward comforting food here, think shepherd's pie, beef burger, eggs ben etc etc. Well priced items, freshly squeezed orange juice always wins extra brownie points in my books. Had the shepherd's pie which was ok, would of gone down better if it was perhaps made in the classical way with mince lamb as opposed to braising diced lamb. \u00c2\u00a0Service, at least the young girl who served or table had to be one of the cheeriest I've had in Singapore.","327":"Loved their veggie friend rice. why cant they have more vegetarian chinese places in the USA?","328":"Best place for vegetarian Chinese in the middle of bustling Chinatown.","329":"First time here... I don't often visit vegetarian places... But wanted to give it a try. Had a couple dishes. Butter prawns... Wow of I closed my eyes I might be fooled... This was my favorite dish of the night. The cedar wood fried rice really seemed like cha sui fried rice... The fragrant salt chicken was good flavor but was rather dry... Maybe some chopped peppers and garlic and scallions would have helped. Didn't enjoy the kungbao monkey bread mushroom. The dishes were a but on the small side. Overall a good experience where I for I wasn't eating meat.","330":"Enjoyed my meal here. It's a good place to stop for lunch if you're sightseeing in Chinatown because it's right next to the Buddha Tooth Relic temple, a huge tourist drawcard. I happened to go around Vesak Day so it was super-crowded and they didn't have any seats available inside. Luckily, I was able to get a seat at a tiny, rickety table outside, and even though it was hot and sticky out, I had a nice view of the temple and it was nice people-watching too.They have both a Chinese-style menu and a Western-style menu here. Everything's vegetarian but not everything is vegan. I ordered a curry, but they accidentally brought me the shakshuka. It looked nice but it comes with egg, and as a vegan I can't eat egg, so I had to apologetically tell them I couldn't eat it. They apologised profusely for their mistake and brought out the correct dish in a hurry. They were really nice even on such a busy day for them.Reasonable prices, too.Definitely recommend this place for some Chinese food (or Western food!) in Chinatown, whether you're vegetarian or not.","331":"We enjoyed this meal! My vegetarian fianc\u00c3\u00a9 said it was the best food he had eaten in a while. First, when you walk in, be sure to find the staircase and go to the 2nd floor (the first floor is a different restaurant). They have air conditioning, and it wasn't set too cold, it was just right. The ladies were pretty nice (we did laugh when our server told my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 he couldn't have sugar for his hot tea because it's not good for the body...she was totally serious). The menu was very extensive and we loved that they would tell you a name of a dish, then give you a description of how they make it. So, you would know that the inside of some piece of mock meat was tofu or veggies or mashed potatoes, and what it would be coated in (like a crunchy fried coating or a fried tofu skin). It's worth noting that all of the \"meats\" are vegetarian, so you can't accidentally order something with meat or fish. We ate the Peking duck, the BBQ pork ribs, and the sweet and sour pork. My favorite was the BBQ ribs, which were so yummy with some rice. The Peking duck was tasty, but nothing like real duck. They served it with lettuce to put it in and sweet chili sauce. The sweet and sour pork wasn't too sweet, it was nicely flavored. The meat nuggets were perfectly fried and not too firm like some we've tried at other places. We were very happy, and would definitely come back next time we are in Singapore.","332":"Fantastic vegetarian Chinese foods, not western vegetarian. \u00c2\u00a0$15 usd lunch normal, so very reasonable. \u00c2\u00a0The staffs are very friendly and eager to please. \u00c2\u00a0Return a few times. \u00c2\u00a0Love it","333":"Nice peaceful upstairs restaurant just a block away from the Smith Street hustle and bustle. Seems to be popular with the locals after a temple visit. A pot of loose tea is $5 but really lovely. The chrysanthemum flowers plentyful and fragrant. The menu has many faux meat and seafood dishes as well as a nice selection of vegetables and medicinal soups. All come in different sizes.The single meat dish that I miss since becoming a vegetarian is crispy duck, so chosing the faux version seemed like a no brainer. Not only was it crispy perfection but it was almost impossible to tell from the real thing. The lemon sauce was tangy and not too sweet. I love that their steamed rice is whole grain.There are several desserts to chose from, some of them contain milk, so be mindful if you are vegan. The sweet taro delight was different but I enjoyed it very much. It was a giant sweet potato dumpling in warm \u00c2\u00a0coconut milk. Not too sweet.Now for the not so great part. The spiced beans I thought were complimentary ended up being $2 when the bill arrived. It's not right to charge for something I did not ask for. At least they should let you know up front. They also charge $0.30 for the moist towel in addition to the 10% service charge.Finally, the service also lacked. Both waiters were standing around without clearing my plates or asking whether wanted anything else. I finally flagged them down after sitting over empty plates for 10-15 minutes. The food is five stars all the way but they need to improve the service.","334":"This is the best vegetarian restaurant I've eaten so far. My family visit them frequently and we always visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple after that. They are located at Sago Lane you will see it on the right hand side if you approach from South Bridge Rd. The entrance is a door leading to staircase. The dining areas are on the second and third floor. Yes.. you will have to climb up the stairs.The portion is not huge. When we ate there (with my family) we order about 4-5 dishes for the 3 of us. The portion is suitable for sharing so if you have more people you will get a chance to taste a good variety. I really love their olive fried rice... yummy. My son love the hot-plate mushroom. Another dish that I'd recommend is the Seaweed Beancurd soup, it is a clean soup and it's very tasty. The dishes there are not oily so it is suitable for the elderly who don't want to eat oily food. Some of the dishes are their homemade recipes so do ask them about these. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and helpful and they have been there for a while. The owner is a very nice gentlemen and I think his daughter is running the place now.Our bill came up to $50-$60 most of the time for 4-5 dishes. You should give it a try if you are up for vegetarian food.","335":"I love this place!! They're friendly, fast, fun, and tasty! Places like this one remind you that when vegetarian food is cooked properly, nothing is missing in flavor or texture. You can even eat some comfort foods \"long lost,\" like satay, mutton curry, or other varieties of faux meat dishes that don't taste \"fake,\" as they sometimes do elsewhere. I highly recommend it for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike! The bottom line is that it's just great food from great people!!","336":"I loved this place! The service was fast and kind, the ambiance was charming, and the food was so scrumptious! All of the ingredients tasted fresh and the seasoning and flavors were spot on! I'm definitely going back!","337":"This place blew me away. I had the nyonya fish one night and the shark's fin soup the next. I relish being able to try things vegetarians usually can't have, but beyond that, the execution is impeccable. Perhaps New York is a few miles behind Singapore in the vegan food arena, but I was very much impressed.","338":"This has gotta be the best ever Chinese vegetarian place in the world. I've been here multiple times - the place, food and the owners of the restaurant are extremely nice. Curry mutton and veg chicken with fragrant salt are my staple here. They are delicious, crispy and has the right amount of spice . I was surprised when I learned that the food has no onions or garlic. I so wish this had more branches across the globe, at least in the USA.","339":"Our first dish was the baby choy sum. What was interesting about eating this dish to me was that even though they weren't soft, I still really liked them. This was my aunt's and my favorite dish. The veggies were only stir fried, but it had a really good wok taste \/ flavor. Even though it wasn't soft, which is what I like eating, the vegetable still tasted fresh, good, and healthy (it could do with a little less oil though, I like to have as least as possible amount of oil in my food since I was raised in a household that used more water than oil to cook the vegetables). We got the small portion of the baby choy sum. If I end up coming here again, I would definitely get the medium portion as opposed to the small.There was a vermicelli dish's notation said: served on birthdays, new years, and special occasions. Sounded kinda mysterious to me, and was then instantly sold since I wanted to try some this \"special\" vermicelli noodles! I consider my first Singapore visit \/ trip to be a special occasion, so what better way than to celebrate this visit with some special longevity noodles?? The noodles were more on the tame side. I wasn't crazy about the baby bok choy since it was rougher than I would like it to be. The noodles were cooked well and tasted good with those flaky things on top. Unfortunately, the menu didn't say what the flaky golden brown things were... So I, myself, can't tell you what they are. o.O If I come again, I would try another noodle dish instead of getting the longevity noodles again. I just wanted to try what the big deal is about this dish. My verdict of these noodles? Really not a big deal. Thus, I'd rather try something else next time.The sweet & sour veg. fish concludes the last dish of this meal. To my surprised, I actually liked this dish quite a bit. I don't like it as much as the baby choy sum because I've just always been a big vegetable fan, eater, and lover. I was surprised that I liked this dish because I usually hate eating \"vegetarian meat or seafood.\" I only got this because I like trying sweet and sour food, haha. This sweet and sour sauce and dish paired nicely with the longevity noodles. So I ate them together, a lot. The baby choy sum paired well with the noodles too, but in my opinion, leafy greens pair well with everything, anything, and even alone. I would get this sweet and sour veg. fish if I visit again.I had a good experience here. We came around 11:30 a.m., shortly after the restaurant opened. Thus, the restaurant was empty when we first got in, and then a few other groups came in a bit later. Still, I get the sense that there aren't many vegetarians in Singapore, that's why I think the restaurant was on the emptier side even though the restaurant is nice and spacious, especially for a restaurant in Chinatown! I do think the small baby choy sum was on the pricier side (it was the best tasting but smallest dish), while the sweet & sour veg. fish and noodles were fairly priced. Our lunch total came out to approximately $45 SGD.","340":"The first thing that I noticed when I entered this restaurant was that it had very traditional Chinese furnishings - which was very nice. The service is also attentive but not overbearing (which is an important factor for me). The menu is really quite long, which is good because you have a lot of variety but bad because it's hard to make up your choice! All in all, all the food I tried was nice - nothing was bad, nothing was exceptional, but they were all pretty good. The first and best dish that we tried is the Mock Lemon Chicken. The texture - achieved through the use of soy protein, did approximate that of tender chicken, and it was infused with a delicate lemon flavour, and drizzled with a mayo-like sauce. It came terrifyingly close to the real thing and I wouldn't mind eating this on a regular basis.We also had the Dou Miao with Golden Mushrooms, which was cooked perfectly and the vegetables and mushrooms were nested in a flavourful broth. Next, we also had the Fried Olive Rice, which was quite satisfactory - the olives imparted a nice flavour and the overall taste was awesome.Black Pepper Monkey Head Mushrooms Overall, this is a definitely worth coming back again for the awesome vegetarian treats!","341":"Amazing flat whites, good wifi and outdoor seating. The seats outside don't get table service so you'll have to flag them down but the people-watching is more appealing than the drab interior.","342":"Disappointing - I've had a lot of great Chinese vegetarian food and this wasn't it. One good thing was that the waitstaff was nice.","343":"I really like this place.Located next to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum , this vegetarian restaurant gets crowded during Buddhist holidays,- after visiting the temple to give offerings, worshippers will usually come over for a meal during lunch time. I think it's quieter on weekday evenings. Vegetarian food can be quite simple\/plain-tasting or sometimes flavoured with additives to mask the tastelessness . The food here however tastes really healthy without compromising on the flavour. I usually start of with the Local Spinach soup before going to order a series of dishes to share amongst 3-4 people. They have a crazy amount of options on the menu but my favourites include the Mushroom\/Tofu box , crispy fragrant lotus roots, and dou miao with golden mushrooms.I think given the wide variety of dishes , the efficient service and the reasonable price , this is one of the better vegetarian restaurants around. You can expect to spend around $25 \/ person for a full meal.","344":"Delicious! I highly recommend this place for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. After walking around for over an hour and a half looking for a vegetarian friendly place in the neighborhood (not easy), I stumbled upon this place and wow what a pleasant surprise. I had the most delicious meal I have had yet in Singapore and the 8 Treasure Tea is a must. Service was also excellent. I asked our young waitress what herbs were in the tea and she didn't know the name in English but googled it for me. Don't miss this place.","345":"I always enjoy this restaurant and have become somewhat of a regular. Unfortunately I usually end up over-ordering because so many menu items look appetizing. Great customer service - they sat us despite closing time. I would only say the restaurant could do a bit better on cleanliness.","346":"I think it was the otak (fish cake) that I enjoyed the most. \u00c2\u00a0Open kitchen, loads of seating, friendly staff, Malaysian\/Asian fusion I would say...not just Asian fusion by itself. \u00c2\u00a0An all day dining concept with lots of Malaysian favorites, noodles, rices, satay, lemak, laksa, soup, loads of drinks...and even a Western burger to boot! \u00c2\u00a0The menu has lots of pictures to better understand what you might be eating, for the uninitiated or visitor to Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Food and drink per person ran about $20SGD and it was pretty tasty. I think there are lots of lunch specials for about half the price to \"turn & burn\" the working crowd. \u00c2\u00a0 I ordered a variety plate of sorts and the white fish was hot and delicious, but the otak fish cake was perfect, seasoned well and to my liking. \u00c2\u00a0 My only critique is that Pappamia lacks an identity...it was the hamburger at a Malaysian spot that kind of through me off (you go to a burger joint for a burger...right?). \u00c2\u00a0Regardless, we had a good dinner and enjoyed the quiet midweek ambiance, so we will return. \u00c2\u00a0Super busy at lunch, not so busy at dinner.","347":"Won a $60 voucher to dine at Pappamia! Yay!! So we drove out to redeem our voucher at this new outlet at Marina Bay Link Mall. Pappa Fried Koay Teow $9.50 - this is the Penang version that is not too black like our local ones. I liked the wok-Hei in this one and really tasty. Can compare with the yummy ones from the Penang Place at Biopolis. Nyonya Nasi Lemak $12 - why Nyonya? I also dunno. Maybe the yellow rice? The other side dishes are about the same as normal nasi lemak. They make a mean fried chicken so that's important. Nothing like a lousy fried chicken to dampen the nasi lemak experience. Haha...Pappa Beef Burger $12 - daughter chose this and that's so typical of an 8 year old. Anyway, according to my tween epicure, the burger was only ok. That means 'skip it unless you're a tween too'. Satay (12 sticks) $13 - the meat on the skewers were a tad tough (though tasty) as there wasn't the usual bits of fats in-between. Healthy and still tasty. Otah Omelette $8.50 - it's actually bits of Otah that's broken up and beaten eggs were poured over the Otah bits. Overall the omelette was not bad but can't taste the Otah as the bits are too small. We also had 3 drinks amongst us that cost from $2.50 to about $5 each. The drinks are fusion mix of Malaysian favourites like Gula Melaka and Ching Chao and milk tea and many others. Interesting results but not too cheap lah. The food was quite good (well the asian ones at least) and for an uptown mall like marina bay link mall, Pappamia is a good place to get good value and good taste.","348":"Located just a few minutes walk from Novena MRT, is\u00c2\u00a0Sinn Ji Hainanese Chicken Rice. Facing Thomson Road and just behind the bus stop, it's very conveniently located. Sinn Ji is opened by hawkerpreneurs, at just 26 years old, Derwin wants to share his passion of delivering mouth watering dishes and a memorable hainanese chicken rice meal!Roasted Chicken Noodle (dry\/soup) $5.80If rice isn't your thing, fret not, Sinn Ji offers noodle options as well!\u00c2\u00a02. Roasted\/Steamed Chicken ($32\/whole; $16\/half)Sinn Ji's Roasted Chicken glimmers with a thin and light brown chicken skin. The chicken comes all oiled up and the sauce was not too salty, yet still having its distinct fragrance.The juicy steamed chicken that is coated in a thick layer of soy sauce is poached at what Derwin deem as the optimal temperature. The result, moist and tender chicken, and a thick layer of jelly under the skin!Rice sounds simple, but is the cornerstone of any Hainanese Chicken rice meal. Here at Sinn Ji, it's no different! Top off your place with a braised egg.Sinn Ji is convenient for those who wish to have more foods than just chicken rice in one meal, they offer items like Crispy Thai Style Tofu, which has gone through a few rounds of improvements. The results, sweet, tangy sauce covering a crisp brown tofu skin!The chicken cutlet was alright, but to decide between Hainanese steam chicken versus this, I'll definitely go for their steam chicken. But I guess, some kids can be a bit picky and who doesn't love fried chicken?Overall :\u00c2\u00a0For those who want to taste a good plate of chicken rice but cannot stand the sweltering temperatures in Singapore, Sinn Ji is an ideal choice. The place is air-conditioned, clean, bright and comfortable, serving up quality Hainanese steamed and roasted chicken! Don't forget to bring yout family :)","349":"The most expensive pancakes of my life - was it worth it? \u00c2\u00a0Depends on how much you like pancakes! :-) But seriously, this isn't like any other pancake you'll have and while you need to get there early to make sure you have a place (they consistently sell out of the special pancakes and everyone in your party needs to buy at least one item, though they don't all have to buy pancakes).","350":"If you want to try the infamous Japanese fluffy pancakes head to Gram in Vivo City HarbourFront Singapore!!!!! The pancakes are extremely light, fluffy and really jiggly!!!!! They go great with syrup, butter and a lot of cream!!!!!!! They are extremely flavourful as well!!!! Just make sure that you arrive and lineup outside the store at 11:00, 3:00 or 6:00!!!!!! Every person has to order something as well so try out the mango and green tea frappes if you don't want too many pancakes!!!! The frapp\u00c3\u00a9s are very refreshing and extremely flavourful!!!! Go try this place out!!!!","351":"This was some of the best Chinese food I had while in Singapore. They have many locations throughout Singapore. The servers are very nice and fast. The menu is very extensive. You can have anything from dim sum, to congee & noodles, to traditional entrees. I had congee and dim sum. All of it was excellent and fresh. This particular location is in a mall which is convenient. It's well lit and very clean.","352":"Still my favourite Chinese food restaurant since I tried their 100am outlet. Food was served fast on a Saturday afternoon and service was efficient and pleasant. There is the option of which part of the duck\/chicken you'd like should you order their roasted specials, and an additional $2 for the leg. I would recommend choosing the duck leg when ordering the roasted duck noodles-it's extremely flavourful and the duck meat is served in a generous portion. Other dim sum dishes I usually order include their chicken feet and fried shrimp in bean curd skin. Absolutely love them!","353":"Had the #16, #21, #78, #89 (with duck and pork), and another #78. \u00c2\u00a0Every single thing was delicious and brought out quickly. \u00c2\u00a0Friendly waitresses and good prices. \u00c2\u00a0Highly recommend!!","354":"This Mexican restaurant is at the head of Haji Lane, and that lends half the charm. There's live music and an under-lit ambiance. The nachos & guac was very average, but the main course quesedilla and enchiladas were full of flavour. The service was quick and efficient.","355":"Pretty good Mexican food (for Singapore) and a decent happy hour. There is live music at night, great atmosphere and the staff is attentive and friendly. Salud!!!","356":"Five stars for affordable happy hour margaritas. Five stars for great murals. But the food isn't worth it (not surprising, as it is just about as far away from Mexico as you can get). I'd recommend it if you're just looking for a nice spot to post up and drink a slushee marg while you watch the tourists go by. But go just about anywhere else in the neighborhood for your dinner.","357":"Margaritas and Tacos, also super delicious Pico de Gallo... Our neighbor compares this place to Yucatan and Acapulco, sooo epic!Fresh mixed Guacamole at our table, attentive nice staff - a lively place - just right.We will be definitely back around here!","358":"As a native Southern Californian, I have tried to eat only cultural foods while in Asia until I returned to the warm bosom of Mexican food back home. But I had to have my Margarita fix and this place went far beyond my expectations! Great atmosphere and the esquites were exquisite!","359":"Very Good food, best in the street, but service so bad: lazy people, food takes a Lot of time to arrive. The waiter esmoking infront of you and using mobile phone all the time","360":"I don't understand why this place has any bad reviews.. It's so delicious and they have great service! They make guacamole table side and it was so delicious. Our sever was super friendly and even let us use multiple credit cards to pay our bill. If you are looking for Mexican food in Singapore I would definitely recommend. WITH LOVE FROM CHICAGO USA !","361":"Great location on Haji Ln, right next to live music! I can only speak to the smoothies I got--they were really fresh and flavorful, but a little on the pricey end. Nevertheless, a cool spot to check out on Friday or Saturday nights!","362":"Love this place. Nice mexican\/american food, in lovely Haji Lane, at a great price. Beers are super cheap (for Singapore standards), and all the dishes I've tried have been very good. I love the terrace and the atmosphere in this place.Order the nachos w\/guacamole, which is done at your table right in front of you.","363":"A massive building with multiple entrances, practically spanning the whole block between Haji Lane, Bali Lane, Beach Rd. and the alley that becomes Baghdad St. No way to miss it, just look for people taking selfies beside a kitsch \"Mayan\" mural on Haji Lane.Having read the menu before, our expectations were very high. When we eventually visited Piedra Negra, my wife and I had a more than decent guacamole to start. We tried the lentil soup which is fabulous, tasty, simple and with a certain home-made quality. Our expectations went higher. While Diana had some really good chicken enchiladas made with a very hot and tasty green sauce, I asked for a lamb mixiote which turned out to be quite disappointing (expectations crashing down here). I need to explain: mixiotes are meat stews wrapped in the outer skin of maguey (century plant) leaves, or in aluminium foil or baking paper. The fact that I was given a stew inside a cute iron pot instead of wrapped in paper \u00c2\u00a0means our pals at Piedra Negra don't understand what the dish is about. To be fair, the stew itself was delicious with the soft lamb melting in my mouth, worthy of a good Irish or Czech restaurant.The drinks menu has a decent assortment of tequilas, and a few Mexican beers, served with lime wedges just like everywhere, except in M\u00c3\u00a9xico. They have a single brand of mezcal, but it's the good stuff (I even got the worm for myself). Piedra Negra is a fun, lively place with salsa music, tasty food and a colourful, albeit kitsch environment. It's a pity they sell themselves as a Mexican restaurant. The fact that they put so much effort in looking Mexican rather than cooking Mexican ends up reinforcing stereotypes, instead of undermining them.Curious fact: the Mexican Embassy, ironically, is across the street.","364":"I warned myself before coming here--braced myself and held my breath until my face turned red. But, alas! My local friend insisted and told me that her expat friends liked, yadda, yadda. Fine, fine...I've tried Piedra Negra's nachos before and their margaritas are pretty solid so why not just try a fish taco? Big mistake. The food here is horrendous. Nothing comparable to Mexican in California or TexMex in Chevys. After living in Singapore for the past three years, my expectations were LOW. Their baja fish taco tasted like sandpaper. The batter used to fry the fish was too thick and the fish was not fresh.As a prime establishment in Arab St., Piedra Negra simply needs to do better. With the new food culture popping up in Singapore (and the new array of Mexican restaurants), this one is a big thumbs down.","365":"My short residency in Texas and Southern California got me totally hooked onto Mexican food so been trying many different restaurants in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0I know that it's not quite comparable but given that we really don't have Mexicans or Latin Americans here, the food is as close as you can get from authenticity point of view. \u00c2\u00a0Not the best but not bad either. \u00c2\u00a0Conveniently situated and there are tons of both indoor and outdoor seating available here.","366":"I'm a big fan of this place. The ceviche is excellent and the portions are pretty generous. I've eaten here only a couple of times, but it's been consistentIy good. \u00c2\u00a0really love the relaxed vibe.","367":"Great vibe on a great street! \u00c2\u00a0We only drank when we visited but the food looked and smelled delicious. \u00c2\u00a0The setting is great for upbeat Friday or Saturday socializing and I'd love to return to try the food at some point!","368":"Came here yesterday for Cinco De Mayo, only to find out they celebrated it on Saturday. Cinco De Mayo literally translates to 5th of May. Disappointing and weird.So there's that. But let's continue...Ambiance: Awesome! They really went out of their way to make this place jazzy, the result is quite fun. Service: Asked 3 times for chips and salsa. They came back and repeated our order twice (he didn't write it down and kept forgetting). Then 30 min later someone came to tell us they were out of one of the two items we ordered. Then they charged us twice for the same item. I also noticed the tables around us were getting up and going to the bar when they needed someone, as the servers were either absent or had forgotten.Safe to say the service is pretty bad.Food: Guac is a very small portion for $10, they prepare it at your table so we saw that they use only one avocado, a shot glass of tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00c3\u00b1os and cilantro (WAY too much for just one avocado) and lime juice----missing much needed SALT! The burritos were good, very small compared to a burrito you would get in Mexico or the states, but tasty enough. Though they forgot to add beans. And for the price, it's hard to complain too much (much cheeper than Baja Fresh). In conclusion, I would order food for takeaway, or possibly come back when I had an hour to wait for my food. Otherwise, you can get more authentic Mexican at Baja Fresh for a bit more money. No joke.","369":"I heard great things about this Mexican restaurant's authenticity, but if this is authentic Mexican food, I am really not a fan. \u00c2\u00a0The food is at best average. I must say, however, that the Strawberry Margherita was delicious and that proved to be the highlight of our meal. It came in a generously sized jug that could be shared amongst many. There are better Mexican spots out there, but if you insist on visiting (because, well, the location is great, and I did love the quirky decorative elements like the skeleton dolls), take note to avoid sitting by the main road. The sounds of traffic will compete with, and beat, whatever conversation you are attempting to have, and there are stagnant smells coming from the drains. Instead, walk down the small alley and try to get a table at the back.","370":"Decent place with a good ambience. Food was passable - have had much better Mexican cuisine elsewhere. Service was good on a busy night. The highlight was the guacamole which was assembled table side - unfortunately the portion was a bit on the stingy side","371":"In Texas after a fun night of drinking and bar hopping, one usually stops at Taco Bell for \"fourth meal.\" Unfortunately, Singapore does not have Taco Bell, but they do have Piedra Negra. We were out last night and before grabbing our cab to go home, we stopped at Piedra Negra. We got a table outside. Our waitress was prompt and friendly. My husband and I split a beef burrito which came with delicious waffle fries. Our friends split nachos. Now can you really compare it to Texas Tex Mex or California Mexican food? Probably not, but you are in Singapore. Honestly, we thought it was delicious, the prices were reasonable and we'll be back!","372":"Great location in Haji Lane and after several visits to the area and eating elsewhere, we decided to give this a try. Mexican food in Singapore is a bit hit or miss, so we were not sure what to expect. \u00c2\u00a0After our visit, I would say this veers more towards a miss. Chips and Guacamole were OK. It was made up at the table with a little too much lime and the portion size was a little on the small side. The main courses did try to be a little different from the norm, but were really just not that tasty. Dessert was probably the highlight, with the Corn Cake being very good. All in all, this is a cool place to go for drinks, with the Margaritas being especially notable, but for good Mexican food, try elsewhere.","373":"Piedra Negra- yes, five stars. California girl reporting in.....love this place.* star- Food:fresh, fresh ingredients. Excellent flavors. Beautiful presentation. Ordered a variety of tacos and table side prepared guacamole with freshly made chips. Loved all the herbs, spices and sauces that you could add to accommodate your palate. Again very F-R-E-S-H! Live in Cali, traveled to Mexico countless times, Central American mother-in-law. This is good food...Trust!* star- Staff: knowledgeable, helpful, professional. Although it was a very busy night we were seated quickly. Staff very attentive through the evening. * star- Restaurant: Art, art, art. cool Mexican murals cover the walls inside and outside. Reminds me of Lucky Street in San Francisco's Mission Dist. \u00c2\u00a0lots of different seating options...Out, in, in-between. Bar, restaurant...etc. it's all good.* star- Location: cool area, a cool \"scene\" Just really great for people watching. *star- good South of the Cali border drink menu...I had Awesome Margaritas. Option of pitcher or single glass, cubed ice or blended ice. This restaurant is COOL people. Check it out!","374":"I've been here twice and I enjoyed it. Gashouse Egg is their specialty and I strongly recommend you to try it if it's your first visit. It's like egg in the hole, bread toasted till crispy but the yolk is not overcooked. I'm in love with their bacon jam on the side.Coffee is definitely the selling point here.I tried their choc croissant during my second visit. It was good. And because I couldn't forget my love for their bacon jam, I requested for the jam on the side (add $2). I know it sounds weird but the savoury jam actually went well with the sweet croissant.Be warned that this place is always very crowded on weekends!","375":"Well I can say that for a company that has Coffee in its name sure live up to its name. \u00c2\u00a0Came here just for coffee and was intrigued by the number of people here. \u00c2\u00a0Though aircon was a little warm but still the vibe was still good. \u00c2\u00a0Cappuccino - not bad! \u00c2\u00a0Latte art - nice. \u00c2\u00a0Long black - excellent. \u00c2\u00a0Like they rebaked the banana cake :). \u00c2\u00a0Earned a revisit for sure!","376":"Recently the cafe had updated its menu with new items such as XL crispy chicken burger and Furikake Mushroom pasta. Order was taken at counter with only cash and NETS payment accepted.Sriracha Pork Belly Burger ($15)served with sweet potato friesThe pork belly was fatty with a texture similar to soft bone, although I was expecting a melt in a mouth fatty part with a crispy crust. The burger was not as spicy as expected. It was not messy to eat the burger. The fries was lacking of crispiness.Coffee Soda ($6) It was a glass of soda, accompanied with a glass of espresso. Just add the espresso into the soda before drinking. It tasted like soda drink with a coffee aftertaste. Quite refreshing for a hot day.","377":"Most people come here for the Gashouse Eggs but the Croissants are excellent as well. I tried the basic croissant which comes toasted warm with a side of their homemade jam and butter. The croissant was large and flakey, but not too buttery. It was so good that I devoured it before taking a picture. I'll definitely have to come back to try the coffee next time!They also have some outdoor seating which includes a few hanging coves, which I found perfect for reading. Sitting outside is a nice alternative if you want a bit of peace and quiet. Most of their tables are in the shade, so it's not too hot on a typical day. L","378":"One Man Coffee is tucked away in Crust's shop, using the venue during the day before it gets transformed into a pizza bar at night. Nice ambience, not too noisy for a lazy Sunday morning, and very affordable prices (average $10 as opposed to the $15 average in other cafes).Tried the Gashouse Eggs ($10) and Brioche French Toast with Berry Compote, Candied Walnuts & Fresh Cream ($10). The Gashouse Eggs seemed like a Croque Monsieur, satisfactory, though slightly on the greasy side. Egg could be runnier as well, though the bacon jam on the side was interesting.The French Toast was perfect, not too sweet, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Thoroughly enjoyed it.","379":"Pretty good coffee and desserts. Brunch is legitimately good as well, especially the maple bacon. Hard to find a seat on weekends.","380":"The bacon in the big brekkie is to die for. The eggs are perfect and the sweet dressing on the greens are great combinations to go with a cuppa. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing for a Sunday brunch.","381":"Try the croissants too! Feels like I am back in Australia. A hidden gem with the coffee and the food. The price is not super expensive also. Typical cafe prices.","382":"Ordered the gas house eggs and they tasted awesome. Was more expertly prepared than I expected, which is why I'm rating it 4 stars. Place was small and cosy too (with free wifi)But for a cafe, the coffee definitely needs some work for improvement. (I ordered magic)","383":"I am not in the habit of awarding five stars for a single dish as I normally feel that it requires more than that but trying the French toast with caramelized bananas and salty caramel is just great. I will return just for that. It is perfectly fluffy, not overly sweet and feels fresh. The big brekkie is also very good but it does pale in comparison to the French toast but as I seldom come here alone I will force anyone going with me to share a Big Brekkie and the French toast with me (just a fair warning if I ever suggest going here with you).The coffee is nicely made, perfect execution on all the espresso based beverages. Unfortunately no filters but can head down the road to Pacamara for that. The service has also been very friendly and they managed the packed place rather well. Worth mentioning is that it shares the space with a pizza place so in the evenings it transforms into a pizza place. Never tried the pizzas there but it does make the setting feel a bit strange but nice with some variety from all the other similarly looking places.","384":"I've been rather hardworking for the past couple of weeks in checking out the cafes. Well I must say that Instagram has been most helpful in keeping me updated with the prettiest caf\u00c3\u00a9s on the block and that kinda led me to One Man Coffee, a hole in the wall that shares their shop front with Crust gourmet Pizza Bar along Upper Thomson Road. Sip on the Melbournian Axil Coffee Roaster beans pulled by Sarah Jane (formerly from Immigrants) or E-gene (who pulled his way around MEL). Coffee is little acidic with medium finish. My latte wasn't quite full bodied or milky though. While it's not quite my style, it was sufficient in packing a punch to last me through my afternoon meeting. Coffee is priced between $3 to $6.50. OMC also stocks B.A.O's pastries. I simply love Christophe's croissants, well the French makes the best croissants! The Chocolate pain is also amazing. Get them to heat it up for that crispy flakiness. Better still, have them with honey ham and melted cheese ($6). Cakes are also available and I was seduced by a Salted Caramel Banana Cake.For something a little more than sweets, OMC does all-day-breakfast with a lean but mean menu, all of which come out of a pizza oven! Talk about easy to make but delicious food here! Love the description of the Gashouse Egg aka Toad in hole aka Egg-in-the-bread-with-the-hole-in-the-middle ($10). It's more of a snack I feel. I really do have a monster appetite for breakfast food. The dish is really simple, they really do just make a hole in the fluffy brioche, crack an egg in, top with cheese and into the oven it goes. Almost a croque madame.Really there's no need to be fancy for brekkie when the ingredients are good (hello ooooozy yolk). What's special is that bacon jam which is smoky, meaty and sweet. I could do with a thick layer of that in the toast anytime. Satisfying flavors, a little dry on the edges, not so satisfying portion but that helps save space for other food. The Broiche French Toast ($10) is another popular item and it looked freaking amazing with the homemade berry compote, candied walnuts and fresh cream. Of course the dust of sugary white completes the instagram worthy picture. OMC is a great alternative to the super packed Habitat Coffee which I failed to visit TWICE! Well I guess I'll just have to explore the rest of the Thomson caf\u00c3\u00a9s until Habitat becomes less crowded. Anyhoo, great vibe at One Man Coffee but do go early or be prepared to wait as well due to the extremely small space.","385":"I came here a couple months back with a friend and boy do they really need to improve on service. Seating done by a list is not extremely effective if you have a maitre'd who is easily pushed around. Granted it was a Saturday afternoon and from what I've heard (they're always packed), I felt that it should have been made clear that there was a waiting list for seating. Numerous parties after me all sat down at the same seats and were told of their policy and had to get up soon after. Would slapping a reserve sign on the table be so hard? On to coffee, we had a cappuccino and long black, the milk wasn't frothed well, and the long black was just the darkest point of my life to say the least. Last but not least, everyone around was ordering the french toast, so maybe you might have better luck with that than the coffee?","386":"I stay really nearby and have heard of it before so I decided to try today. This coffee shop's name should be Wobble coffee instead. The tables outside are all wobbling. The wooden plate of food is also wobbling. The Big Breakie is not that fantastic. I like the one slide of bread though. Havent tried the coffee yet ( ya i know. It's such a shame) \u00c2\u00a0I will come back just for the coffee one day","387":"This place has some interesting takes on breakfast. But their interpretations are quite delicious! Many contrasting flavors create some wonderful meals. The grilled cheese was good, the Gashouse breakfast was awesome, as is the breakfast burger. My only negative was that their coffee was pretty average and their breakfasts need bacon strips!","388":"Friendly barista with a good qualify coffee. Nice ambiance and relaxing atmosphere (I'm there at 330pm). The cakes look tempting but I'll keep them for another visit","389":"Sorry... I've had to dock a star. I enjoyed this place for coffee and went back to try a brunch on a Saturday. It was crowded, and the staff weren't very on the ball when it came to seating waiting customers. Tables were cleared but waiting customers were still left waiting... Tried the Big Brekkie and it was OK. The eggs were purportedly 60 degree eggs but I'm pretty sure mine were over cooked and too firm.","390":"Great coffee. An excellent macchiato, not too acidic, smooth and juuust right. Good stuff. Parking in the area is a pain but oh well, try your luck, or walk a bit or take public transport!","391":"Chic japanese themed cafe located in Millenia Walk. Not a typical place that I would head to for a cup of cuppa. Heard and saw pictures of the 3d latte art totally made me want to check it out myself. Coffee beans are from local roastery Liberty Coffee was definitely a plus! Be sure to try out the desserts from the Cordon Bleu pastry chef Gwen Lim who has apparently worked under Pierre Herme himself! Pretty Awesome!","392":"The quiche is amazing and cute cafe latte delicious. If I lived in Singapore I would visit all the time!!!","393":"The Salted Caramel macaron was rather salty for a liking. The Milk Chocolate White Miso macaron started out rather sweet and milky but then the salty taste kicked in after that. The Lychee Rose is probably the better macaron I have ever eaten. It is sweet with very noticeable taste of lychee and rose. For someone who likes sweet stuffs, this fits perfectly into the picture. The Salted Hazelnut macaron is also very nice. The hazelnut taste was very distinct and was less salty.","394":"Had a lovely skinny latte and tasted a bit of a coconut choux tart, which didn't look that inviting but turned out to be delicious. They tend to run out of items (e.g. Croque Monsieur) by later in the day so the early bird catches the worm...","395":"WOW! \u00c2\u00a0The hot chocolate was remarkable, I might just has well have been drinking a chocolate creme soup. \u00c2\u00a0I've never had anything so amazing. \u00c2\u00a0Amazing, good word to describe the desserts as well. \u00c2\u00a0I tried the G-spot, an amazing chocolate mousse creation and another which was a creme broulette dessert. \u00c2\u00a0The tea was excellent as well. \u00c2\u00a0I highly recommend checking this place out. \u00c2\u00a0Walk past the Starbucks and into PatisserieG instead! \u00c2\u00a0You won't be disappointed.","396":"Love, love, love, love the Satay here!!!! I've not had it in a while - but had some 2 weeks ago and I LOVED it. It's really hard to get Pork Satay and I remember lovin' it in Bali - when I had Pork Satay almost every other day - so it was a pleasant surprise to mix and match, Chicken, Pork and Lamb Satay - and the marinade is really yummy. The Satay turned out great and the peanut sauce was excellent too.What I Love: Service was great - the guy who took my order was a young chap, and was eloquent, and did the satay pretty quickly. Ketupat is free, when you order 10 pieces. You will get Ketupat, since minimum order is 10 pieces anyway. The meat was tender, tasted great, and flavors were just yummalicious! It's great to have satay, drink Coconut Juice, and sit out, looking at all the colorful lanterns. Great ambiance. What I Don't Love: Absolutely nothing!","397":"Really good Satay!!! Try them all - pork, beef, chicken, shrimp, lamb","398":"One of my staple breakfast. Soup has depth and good ingredients. An excellent nourishing pick me up in the morning. There are also 2 good kopi stalls here and you should know them out of the 5-6 others here :-)","399":"One of my staple breakfast. Soup has depth and good ingredients. An excellent nourishing pick me up in the morning. There are also 2 good kopi stalls here and you should know them out of the 5-6 others here :-)","400":"Most people review Nassim Hill for it's brunch, to be fair: I have also been several times for brunch and never felt the need to write about it, it is decent but nothing out of the ordinary.When my girlfriends and I discovered they also do Ladies night, free flow prosecco with a minimum spend of 35$ per head, we decided to come on a Wednesday night. I categorized the night as follows:THE GOOD:- Burrata, arugula, tomatoes and watermelon - tasted fresh and yum, almost ordered a second one.- The Big dipper (crab, artichoke and spinach dip): good dip but not enough bread, extra charge for more bread.- Poutine: tasty fries, however they should not call it Poutine as it does not taste like it, more like loaded fries.- Prosecco: two types available and the staff is generous with the top-ups (when asked)THE SO-SO:- Grilled Chicken Quesadilla - Steak and eggs- Sweet potato fries- The service: I guess your typical spotty service, had to ask for top ups of the drinks and remind them of our request for extra bread.THE BAD:- Roasted bone marrow: typically one my favorite things to eat but had literally no flavor, looked impressive though.Overall I find this one of the better Ladies Night deals and there were quite a few dishes I gladly eat again so 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.","401":"Nice play for brunch. We had the skillet eggs (their take on the Shakshouka) and Eggs Benedict. Slightly pricey even by Singapore standards but the food was tasty. Finished off with a pear crumble with ice cream which was delicious!!","402":"First time here. The food came quickly but the service staff needs a lot more training. They don't look happy as well. The waffles were good. I had the bacon cheddar waffles. Very fluffy and tasty. The Belgian waffles were good too. Eggs Ben ok, nothing to shout about. Nice place to have brunch as long as you're having waffles. Will come for lunch or dinner one day to try the rest of the menu.","403":"Don't know who marked this as good for kids! They don't have a kids menu! And that's just the start....","404":"I have been back several times since my review and the food is still good.It can get crowded and they do take reservations. Call early as they will close the reservation list once it reaches its limit. Then it will be walk in only. The menu has been refreshed but the many favorites remained. The skillet eggs is pretty spicy but it is so good. I am quite taken with the spicy huevos Benedict. It comes sprinkled with chili padi. Wow! The coffee is from LIberty Coffee which is one of my favorites, plus it is a double shot. I don't know much about coffee or where Liberty coffee is from, but it is smooth and is not too acidic. I don't need to add sugar to my flat white. So yay!The burger is also a good and safe choice. I am not that into its pasta or poutine though. Get the sweet potato fries and waffle. It is one of the better ones around. For a light bite, the chicken quesadilla is pretty delish. I just saw the dinner menu and the rosemary lamb chop description looks tempting. So I guess I need to go back again for dinner some day.","405":"This is fast becoming a favorite place of mine now. 3 visits within a week is quite a record for me. It is a fairly big place with tables inside and outside. There is also a huge table with high chairs for either communal dining or to share with others. The food I have tried so far has been good. Eggs are antibiotic and hormone free, not that I can taste the difference. The bread is divine. I love the cranberry walnut bread so much I bought a loaf back. Hot Reuben has a generous serve of sauerkraut and the emmental cheese makes the difference in the simple ham and cheese sandwich. If you order the chicken pot pie, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes. It is worth the wait as it comes with a crusty biscuit dome covering the bubbling creamy chicken stew beneath. I am just a bit surprised there is no side salad for that. Tea comes with a pot of hot water and a sealed tea bag (Gryphon) and they do refill with hot water when requested. Service is a bit of a hit and miss. They like to clear the table just when you are taking your last bite or something. Yet when you need them to refill your water glass, it seemed to take forever to get their attention. But the wait staff is generally alright, cheerful and polite.There are still a few items I want to try on the menu, so I guess I will be going back again very soon.","406":"Sitting next to the post office on Nassim Hill is not the best spot for a restaurant, parking not great luckily I can walk from my office for lunch. \u00c2\u00a0They have a decent selection of sandwiches and lunch fares service is ok. \u00c2\u00a0Some of the options are tastier\/more flavorful than others. Not my favorite place but good for change up from typical Tanglin food.","407":"I'm torn between giving 4 and 5 stars, so I'm going to be generous and give a 5. I don't think the place is perfect, but nothing really offended me.I came here for brunch on a Saturday with a friend. The online reservation was fully booked, but they said we could walk in. Walking in before 11am was OK. We were seated immediately. Soon after, the place really started to fill up. I had the bacon and cheese waffles, and my friend had the blueberry pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were extremely fluffy, and tasted just right. My bacon waffles tasted more of bacon and cheese than waffles. Definitely delicious. We ordered a cup of tea each, and that wasn't memorable. They give you a teapot of hot water, which is good for about three teacups. The water kept warm for a long time, which was surprising.I thought the food was well done, although it would have been a better deal if it was a dollar or two cheaper. I used my DBS credit card and got 10% off so that was pretty sweet. This is the first brunch place I've been to in Singapore, and I wouldn't mind coming back again. But I would like to check other places out.","408":"Never returning to this place. There are so many cafes in Singapore, so to be competitive I think the very least is to have kickass food or service. Customer service really sets the tone of your restaurant. I'm sure I had special sauce in my food today. The staff are smiley until a hiccup happens. This is what I mean - today I ordered a cake and coffee set before ordering a snack. This is all within like 10 minutes apart. when the savory snack arrived, I moved the cake to the side to eat the snack first. Halfway through it, I realized the cake was missing! We completely did not see the waitress clear it, but we only had 3 bites and it was such a waste to clear. We informed her it was a mistake and she said she assumed we didn't want it since we put it to the side (Just ask next time!). She was apologetic and said she would get it back. You wouldn't believe what she did next. She brought half a slice of the cake. A half slice! We were weirded out. I mean, what is she going to do with the other half? I thought that was completely cheap. We were like huh? And she told us it's because we ate almost half of the cake (not true) but whatever, the cake was ok tasting but not worth this rubbish! If they can be so cheap, you won't want to know what lame ingredients they may be using. So yeah, no smiles from all the staff after we complained it wasn't cool to be cheap about the cake. It's such a small matter but they've lost some pigs as customers.","409":"Sunday brunch here was an Eggs Benedict. It took a while to come, so be prepared to wait.So my Eggs B wasn't awesome, but the bread they served before you eat what you ordered is amazing, so it made up for the lacklustre eggs. My friend had a decent coffee (or so he said). This place is a wee bit inaccessible without a car, because it's quite far from the nearest MRT station (Orchard), so come here with a friend who drives, or even better, don't come at all. Food was pricy and I didn't feel satisfied with my brunch.","410":"T menu is different and lovely . All sooo so yummy .. Cant decide on a favoriteLook at t drink list too Yummy Yuzu breeze","411":"Great atmosphere for brunch\/lunch Tucked away behind Tanglin post office offers lots of yummy fresh options!!I had the Asian chicken salad which was was a generous helping \u00c2\u00a0but the dressing was lovely!!! Great for just coffee too and situated next door to a Swiss grocery store so \u00c2\u00a0you buy goodies there too xxxx","412":"As my kids just said to me: \"Why aren't we coming here more often?! This is great!\"We dropped in for breakfast after I dragged my kids to get their injections. Consider it an amazing bribe. Our order was delivered quickly and service was fantastic. The food was well prepared, beautifully presented and delicious. The food & ambiance is unpretentious and comforting. My flat white was full flavoured without relying on fancy coffee art to tell me it was well crafted. (I am not against coffee art if the coffee is good.)Will we be back more often? Definitely.","413":"Decided to come here with a few others on a Saturday around 6.45pm. Parking was pretty easy but the layout of the building was like a maze and after 5 minutes, my friend and I figured out how to reach the front of this cafe and towards the end, we realized there was another shortcut (next to the lift) and you could walk in from the back door.Ordered these few dishes1) Tonkatsu (entree) - portion was pretty small and it was only an average dish with a high price tag.2) Full sized chili crab (pasta) - didn't have much crab meats in the dish and doesn't look photo worthy like the pictures on the website my friend gave me.3) Two faced pizza - half salami and half blue cheese with arugula. This was pretty good. Pizza come in thin crusts which made it crunchy. Even though the ingredients were rather normal, somehow the mixed ingredients added flavor to the two different types of pizza.4) popcorn chicken bites - came free as an option if you made a reservation through hungrygowhere. Came in smaller pieces but was pretty good after a few bites. Not as crunchy as I thought it may be and I couldn't taste much of the sriracha sauce.5) pear cheddar crumble (dessert) - was not too bad but would probably prefer the crumbles to be more flaky and crunchy.Price here was pretty steep and the food wasn't too impressive either. Definitely a good place to chill if you are into alcoholic beverages.","414":"Friends suggested lunch here to enjoy the good ambience and good food. I am impressed with the interior design of the cafe which gives out this relaxing vibe once you're inside. Many reviews suggested a Hot Reuben so I'm not gonna ignore that.Turned out that the sandwich was massive (for me at least) and my friend actually betted that I couldn't finish it by myself. So to prove him wrong (I'm a fighter), I ate slowly to savour and also to not overkill myself in the start of the meal. The sandwich was rich in flavour and I can't break it down to the individual tastes but it all came together very nicely. I opted for the set and they had cauliflower soup then. It was smooth and good and flavourful! Nice! The ambience was very chillaxing and a beautiful way to start the morning. The interior is clean and bright, plus it sure doesn't hurt to have the whole place smell of fresh bread to hit you (nicely) in the face as you walk in.Will bring hubby here to share the beautiful experience.","415":"Sat at a table for 20minutes waiting for a server to take our order but we were completely ignored. We left.","416":"Ambience is good, except for the constant drilling upstairs. Food is mediocre, small portions, and the half bok choy they served me was with a bit of cheese. Prices are a little steep for the size, and the Chef is heavy handed with the use of salt.","417":"Good food, fresh ingredients! I'm a fan of the Shakshouka. The hot reuben was a bit disappointing though. Taste of the pastrami was a bit bland, underwhelming. And once again, Singapore, why so kiam siap! (Look at the photo. Just look at it.) There should be twice as much pastrami in there. And more sauerkraut. C'mon. You can't even see the pastrami when the dish arrives!","418":"Popped by around the area during lunchtime on a Tuesday and the staff seemed overwhelmed by the crowd. The pair of us managed to get a seat without reservation luckily. Long story short, our coffee orders got mixed up with the table behind and the Cheddar Cheese with Bacon Waffle arrived at the table looking haphazardly put together. Staff forgot the condiments for the waffle so my partner chewed through half a dry waffle before I realised that the next table had butter and honey to go with their waffles. The skillet eggs I had was really good though and I liked that it was spicier than others I've tried so far. The flat whites which we finally had after much confusion and sorting out, were really decent too. It was just unfortunate that the staff was unable to cope with the swarming lunch crowd on our visit.","419":"what impressed me most is their spaciousness, the stained glass art and their artisan bread.service however, can be spotty. some tables get water automatically but others have to ask for it.their coffee for me is over priced at $6 and of below par standard.a lack of free wifi and sufficiently current reading materials also make it less worth hanging around.sausages and scrambled eggs were nice.charcuterie is nothing to shout about.french toast almond brioche had a nice taste and bite but could be accompanied with some extras like fruits to make it less plain in presentation.the place starts filling up quickly after 10am on a sunday morning.","420":"A go-to brunch place for a couple of reasons.- The Chili Crab Spaghetti is insanely, insanely delicious. Spicy with lots of chilli padi and the most perfect chilli crab sauce, fit for pasta. I happily finished the $25 bowl.- The egg dishes are fairly well done and consistent. The chocolate banana waffle stack is quite a load if you like eating dessert for brunch. I'm personally not a fan of their dry french toast. - The free bread baskets have excellent bread. Eat them carbs people.- Nassim Hill is generally frequented by the older aunty\/uncle or family crowd, as opposed to young kids with SLRs and too much make up. I don't know but somehow that makes me feel more at peace eating a meal there. The tables are also fairly spaced out so you don't have to listen to annoying, vapid mealtime conversations. - Prices are decent The one thing I don't like is the service. It's a bit of a blank-stare-who-ordered-this-item kind of place and they serve water when you're about to die from a parched throat. Otherwise, this is a safe weekend bet.","421":"Went here for New Years brunch. \u00c2\u00a0The atmosphere is relaxed and the food was good. We especially like the quality of the bread. \u00c2\u00a0Has the spicy eggs Benedict and really enjoyed the additional flavor of the jalepenos and chorizo. Service was quick and friendly with plenty of staff.","422":"oops! I guess this update is long overdue.No, you don't get a complimentary bread basket with every meal. Not anymore. You get the bread basket if you order any egg dishes. I still like the coffee! They now have \"afternoon tea\" special - daily from 3p - 6p.any coffee\/mocha\/latte\/hot cocoa\/tea with a slice of cake for $8.95 or so. (below $9). which is a very good deal. I do miss their pancakes though.

Croissants are not good but bred is good.They have a good champagne deal with Perrier-Jouet champagne.If you live in the neighborhood, definitely worth checking out as there is not much else immediatly around.","425":"Recommended by ex-pats living in Shangri-La Apartments... \u00c2\u00a0everything here is fantastic.. steaks, wine, Mac & Cheese..","426":"one of my newest favorites - so good I returned a second time in a matter of three days (sometimes you have to give in be kind to yourself). both times, i was surprised at such fantastic execution of brunch classics - it's good, simple cooking done well; big portions I want for a meal that marries the best of the morning and the start of the afternoon; a beautiful space with beautiful people and the option of champagne.everything we had was better-than-average and well on its way to excellent, so let's start with that. a plate of three american-type pancakes came with a scoop of blueberry ice-cream, berry compote, crumble sprinkles, and REAL maple syrup. the hot reuben is a house specialty - and deservedly so. it's a hearty wholegrain beer bread with enough structural integrity to hold the melting morass of cheese, sauerkraut and corned beef in, served alongside a fresh green salad. quite completely delicious, and properly rave-worthy.on my second visit, I had the grilled cajun chicken on wholegrain; not nearly as fantastic as the hot reuben, but this was a very generous portion of marinated chicken stuffed between actually-crunchy leaves and another bit of good bread.both the poached and scrambled eggs were decently done too - but you must finish with the waffles - dark-brown belgians with crunchy exteriors but still creamy enough inside, dusted with icing sugar and served with more of that delicious syrup. the sausage alongside was tasty enough - it's a hearty breakfast or a could-I-have-more-please dessert.this is as sparkling a review I can write while being objective, and really - just give it a go, it's pretty darn brilliant.","427":"One of our favorite weekend places for brekkie\/brunch. Been here a couple of times and really enjoy the food and relaxed atmosphere here, the service staff are friendly too. Never had a problem with food taking a long time to arrive. So far we've tried the whole meal waffles, pancakes, fish and chips, egg breakfast sets and they were all yummy and of good portions. The coffees here are good too and double shots, only thing missing is they don't have the option of soy milk available. The gingerbread cookie they serve with the coffee and tea are delicious and we usually buy a whole bag to take home :)","428":"Tasty breads and great coffee. If you happen to be in the neighborhood, this is a good place to get a hearty breakfast!","429":"Poor service and overpriced. \u00c2\u00a08 workers there on a lite morning and not even served after 20 minutes.","430":"For full reviews and photos, visit my blog!If you want a quiet brunch in town, Nassim Hill Bakery, \u00c2\u00a0does a good job of satisfying an egg craving. The outpost at the hidden part of Tanglin Post Office is nowhere to be seen from the main road. The place wasn't too packed on a Saturday afternoon. I don't think 1pm is too late for brunch. I hope it stays this way, though i've let out on this secret. Bistro and Bakery by day, Nassim Hill Bakery does a wholesome breakfast food for egg crazy people like me. At night, she transforms into a bar serving unique cocktails and the aromatic Grimbergen draught beers (A Belgian abbey beer first to debut in Asia and exclusive to Nassim Hill and 1128). A dinner menu is also available.All breakfast sets comes with a basket of bread, all freshly baked by Freshly Baked, one of my favorite bakeries! Head Baker Audrey takes charge of the bakery section and supplied Nassim Hill Bakery with the same breads that is ever so perfect and familiar. The bread basket includes the fluffy white ciabatta, the yeasty and malty Grimbergen Ambree bread, fluffy Walnut raisin bread and cereal rye bread.The Hearty Scrambled Eggs ($20) was creamy and runny and it was served with Swiss cheese, French Rosette de Lyon salami or prosciutto with our signature Grimbergen Ambr\u00c3\u00a9e beer bread.Lovely Eggs Benedict ($20) on the airy white ciabatta pillows. Perfectly poached eggs with chunky succulent and sweet smoked ham, creamy hollandaise sauce with the right amount of acidity, what more can i ask for in a Benny? I reluctantly swapped a half of my benny with S's Hot Reuben, which i ordered for him because i wanted to try. Haha. I did not regret exchanging our dishes at all. Seriously, this is the star attraction at Nassim Hill. The Hot Reuben ($18) is a massive sandwich of sliced corned beef with melted emmental cheese, saurkraut, onions and Russian dressing on their signature Grimbergen Ambr\u00c3\u00a9e beer bread. This sandwich is absolutely appetizing and no one flavor overpowered the other. The malty aroma in the bread could be tasted in every bite. This is definitely my must-order from now on. Their coffees ain't quite impressive and neither were their iced teas. The mocha was way too sweet, even for the boy with the sweet tooth. Chocolate syrup=meh but i love the ginger snapps that came with it. Yums. Adding to my list of yummy brunches in town!","431":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. My friend and I started out the day right with a beer each. I had an amber and my friend had a blonde. The beers were poured into frosted glasses, and were very refreshing. I could keep drinking and drinking my amber if not for the fact that my food came very soon after.So I ordered a reuben sandwich. The bread was nice and soft with a slight sweetness to it. The pastrami was tender. There was nice onions in the sandwich too. But I wasn't impressed, and in fact was rather frustrated at why I was still underwhelmed. After a whole day of thinking and discussing with fellow foodies, it finally dawned on me that (and this is kinda embarrassing for me to admit this) the sandwich was just not greasy enough! Maybe I'm used to something with more spice, something with more cheese, something with more warmth. Something this healthier version didn't quite meet.","432":"Overrated. \u00c2\u00a0 Kind of a nice vibe to the place but pretty terrible service and food less than stellar. \u00c2\u00a0Offhand greeting when we came in by the hostess who gestured to us to take seats at a communal table that it turns out were occupied by another couple. \u00c2\u00a0She then said we would need to wait. \u00c2\u00a0Until, that is, we gestured to an empty table outside, which she admitted we were welcome to take. \u00c2\u00a0 Placed our lunch orders, which were not served until over one hour later, after we chased twice. \u00c2\u00a0 Pity they can't up their game.","433":"Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar has one of the most interesting concepts - bakery with brunch items in the dawn, bistro in the noon, and transformed to a charming bar by dusk with DJs spinning at the side. If this bar within a post office concept seems familiar to you, it is also done up by Imaginings who is also behind KPO, WALA WALA, Balaclava and 1128. Beer drinkers can rejoice because you can tap your own draught beers at the end of the counter. (I unfortunately, don't drink beer.) Considering I am not quite a carb-person, I fell in love with the Grimbergen Ambree bread ($8), a Grimbergen (Belgian abbey beers) infused bread created by Head Baker Audrey from Freshly Baked at Killiney Road. (No wonder the bread and cakes taste so familiar. The KPO probably approached her since they are 'neighbours'.) The bread is very wholesome, full-bodied and hearty, with a slightly rustic feel to it. Extremely satisfying with the marmalade jam.","434":"Nice atmosphere and good location. tend to get busy on weekends and during brunch hours. They serve pretty standard western food dishes and comfort food. \u00c2\u00a0The wholemeal Belgian waffle is pretty tasty and the portions are manageable. I'm not too thrilled about the service though. It takes extra effort to get the servers' attention and even longer for them to attend to you.","435":"Terrible experience. We were a group of three and after waiting twenty minutes to get seated we ordered immediately. 40 minutes later out first sandwich arrived. The next sandwich they couldn't tell us when it would be ready, so we took it to go. Very disappointed in the service. We asked several of the staff to check on our food and got blank stares and placating responses (no apology for the delay), but no food. When we finally got the second sandwich in a to-go bag, the waiter said sorry. But if they were really sorry, they would have given us our drinks for free or made some legitimate effort to get us out food in a reasonable time. It really cannot possibly take 40+ minutes to make a BLT with avocado. And that sandwich was forgettable. A small slice of tomato on each half was too paltry. Not going back again and not recommending this place. With so many options in Sg there is no need to have such a terrible experience.","436":"Very nicely decorated food court.To even call this a food court is probably an understatement. This is nicer then a food court. The food is prepared in a nice ambiance, self served or collected with a beeper.Food quality can be disputed depending whether if you are comparing with a normal food court or a food cafe\/restaurant type. It probably stands in between for value and quality.","437":"This was an unexpected find, was planning to go to another bookmarked brunch place, but they didn't have as many egg options as i wanted. So found this place close to our place with decent reviews and went to check it out. Reached at noon (bad time to go for brunch on a weekend) and the place was packed to the seams. Had to wait 30 mins for a table, but the waft of food coming from inside was delicious. The wait was worth it. I got the weekender breakfast - smoked salmon over thick toast with roe and two large perfectly poached eggs. Hit the spot! Wife got the smashed avocado with sourdough which was excellent and they certainly don't skimp on the avocado like certain other places. The cappuccino and tea latte we got were exceptional as well. But the star of the day was the tiramisu, hell, I'll come back just for that. One of the few places in Singapore that I'll be returning to for sure.","438":"Latte was high quality\/upper tier.Pancakes were delicious and egg\/avo\/toast thing was really good!outdoor seating in back was really quiet\/private.","439":"Pretty good caf\u00c3\u00a9 located pretty much away from the hipster enclave of tiong bahru, duxton hill and outram park area. The sister caf\u00c3\u00a9 of Ronin is much brighter with an almost pastel color interior, less stuffy, lots of natural light, an open kitchen with suction \/ ventilation system that works and a big \"green\" wall at the outdoor seating area. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 exudes a relaxing vibe unlike the more \"gothic\" sister (Ronin) located just a short walk away.Punch is located exactly opposite Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Station and about 50 meters away from Dehesa (previously Communal). If you're coming alone or with one or two friends, getting a table is not that difficult but if you're in a group of six and above, it is better to book in advance. The kind folks will hold your table until 11am, before releasing to whoever comes first. \u00c2\u00a0The past weekend, I organized a brunch meetup with fellow yelpers and had a good meal here. The 10 of us ordered almost everything in the menu including the 2 specials. My poached eggs with mashed avocado was pretty good with nicely poached eggs sitting on top 2 slices of sourdough with a side of burnt lemon for that \"earthy\" taste. The portion is perfect for one and just right when you washed down with a cuppa joe, in my case, I chose my favorite chai latte. While some suggest that the chai latte could be more \"milky\" and the spices be more pronounced, I like the way it is. With our ever warm Singapore weather, I like my chai to me on the \"lighter\" side and less milky. It's just a personal preference and it works for me. I took a small bite of my friend's earl grey pancakes with poached pear drenched in chocolate sauce and it was really good and addictive. Again, not too big of a portion for one. While I hope the team could come up with a more extensive brunch menu (currently only 7 items), that's not entirely a bad thing. That means the young budding chefs know their ability and only want to concentrate on a few items they do best rather than an ambitious menu while delivering a mediocre fare. If the usual waffles, porridge and eggs benny doesn't fancy you, then check with the friendly staff on the weekly specials. Staffs are friendly and our glass of water are always filled. While we try to milk a complimentary salted caramel brownie by singing birthday song to me, it was a birthday that I don't even know! And if you wonder, we failed in the attempt. The salted caramel brownie comes with a price tag of $5. If there's one thing that puts me off is the price that is perhaps, a tad higher than your usual cafe. But then, it's Singapore where you're expected to fork out extra at a slightly better establishment. I'm definitely coming back to check out their dinner one of these days. Punch is a solid 3.5 star, round up to 4. Good stuff","440":"This is a gorgeous little spot. The staff are lovely, coffee perfect and food thoughtfully made and presented. It was so good we went twice in one day. First for brunch, I had already eaten so just had a soya chai and the must delicious cookie. My husband had the smashed avocado with poached eggs and grilled lemon on toast which looked and tasted great. We then returned for a very early dinner just before they closed at 6pm because we wanted to try the prawn and scallop pasta. It was worth it. The herbs and garlic in the sauce were perfectly balanced and the seafood cooked with the nice crispy crust, only available on week days. Punch runs like an engine with every staff member knowing their function but also able to fill in any gaps that appear. There are many other items on the menu to try and I hope we get time to go back before we take off.","441":"We visited the sister cafe of Ronin and The Plain on a Saturday afternoon. If not for the fact that my friend is a frequent visitor, I won't have been able to find the place due to the lack of visible signage. We shared the coffee, poached eggs with avocado, poached eggs with salmon and earl grey pancakes amongst the two of us. Food was unexpectedly delicious! Being an avocado fan, I was more than pleased to see a generous serving of avocado on my sourdough toast. It was a pity the toast was too hard. The brioche that came with the salmon was perfect, thankfully, and felt very Japanese with the ikura. Servings were satisfying for the eggs but the pancakes were on the smaller side, which may not suffice for big eaters. It reminded me of McDonalds hotcakes in looks but more delectable. The coffee was decent but a little sour for my liking. I will definitely be back for the food.","442":"The atmosphere is great on a Sunday morning, with a bustling and happy crowd.The food is fresh and tasty, and the serving portion on the The Weekender Egg is very generous.The Long Black has excellent flavour.The service staff are very attentive and polite.And they have Apple Pay !","443":"Compared to Ronin, the decor of Punch is not as cosy. Though it is tastefully done, there was something quite clinical\/impersonal about the space, which wouldn't make it a top choice for me (perhaps it was the slight aloofness of the hipster staff, but I wouldn't hold it against them, it's just a personal preference.) Though note that half the space is set up almost as if catered for the lone customer who wants to get some reading and work done, which is great.I had the chai latte (I know, in a coffee establishment?!). Although they apparently brew it (not from some teabag), it was a lacklustre chai latte. :( A bit diluted, not rich, spicy and milky the way I like it. My friend and I also shared the earl grey pancakes, which was not bad, the roasted macademias and crumble on the side was a nice touch, but I wish the earl grey was a bit stronger. Pancake texture was so-so (erm yes, similar to Macdonald's hotcakes). I really wanted to like the place, but I think I'd stick with Ronin.","444":"This place is great for a quick, simple breakfast! The toast slices are not thick, so keep that in mind. If you're looking to eat healthy, this is not the place lol the put a TON of thick butter slabs in between the toast but it is honestly so delicious, especially with the kaya (fruit jam that tastes very sweet like honey and peanut buttery). If you order the set, hey serve this with two large runny eggs. If you do not like runny eggs, like me, you can either leave them aside or give it a try! I mixed them together and added a bit of vinegar and soy sauce hat was on the table and gave a a stir, then dipped the bread slices in it. We ordered the regular butter and the peanut butter toast and can't complain about either.The matcha frostyz was very good! It tasted like a Starbucks frappe but matcha flavored, I would order it again if I could. Honestly, if they had this place in the states I would go all the time because it is a simple concept of something that everybody loves, made in a fast food version!","445":"It's toast it's edible. \u00c2\u00a0 I could have done with a little more kaya spread as they were pretty stingy with it. \u00c2\u00a0The drinks were quite good - ginger mills tea and the half and half cofee tea. \u00c2\u00a0Minus points for giving us a cup with old lipstick stains on it.... maybe I'm just fed up at this point because so many places in Singapore employ people that have no clue how to clean things properly. \u00c2\u00a0 I'm not talking about street stalls either...those places I give a pass to.","446":"Kaya Toast with butter is a Singaporean traditional breakfast that is simply put - amazing. You do have to like runny eggs, but sopping them up with your Kaya Toast is part of the experience.","447":"This is a great place for breakfast. The service is good and staff are polite and friendly. But this place is hard to find for new visitors. Overall it is 4 stars to me.","448":"Mother's cooking. Reasonable priced sandwiches and a very nice and clean cafe with window seats looking into Tiong Bahru. There's also an actual piano so if you're game go right at it!Perfect air-conditioned place for a coffee and a cake otherwise in the afternoon.","449":"A nice cafe with plenty of sunshine coming in thru the windows! I tried their lunch set menu, which comes with a pita and ice tea, the price is decent however portion is quite small. Definitely recommended if u just want to find a place for a good chat and some sweet dessert!","450":"This place is getting more and more crowded.... You are actually spoilt for choice when wanting a cuppa coffee in Tiong Bahru. Whisk is but one of the many cafes around the area offering you a decent cuppa coffee and pastries. Price range is about the same as most others. Pastry and cake selection not as wide. But still a nice place to just people watch (right at the cross road where Tiong Bahru market is) or just read a book (not as busy as Tiong Bahru bakery right across the road, and definitely not as noisy...). No wifi though and I don't see power points around...","451":"Clean and cool inside. They have some kind of neato popsicles but didn't try those. Hokkaido milk flavor was one that stands out. Honestly ducked in here to use the restroom bc I didn't wanna use the ones at the market. The hub got some English tea and a cream pastry which he said was alright. It was bright inside. And the bathroom was super cute and clean although outdoors kind of so felt hot. Still grateful to be able to use it. They also have French macarons which were v pretty. Not sure of the taste though.","452":"Beautiful cafe, went on Friday at 3 pm and there were a lot of seats, so that was nice. Staff was very friendly and the food was great! Ordered the strawberry shortcake that costed 6.5$, the chocolate croissant (it looks like a danish) that was 7$ and the raspberry scone for 4.5$. I ordered the cappucino and it was presented very cutely, with a teddy illustration! The cappucino also came with a cute lil biscuit! Their iced mocha was super delicious, and it costed 7.5$ (it was really good). Their Blissful Berries drink (it's under the tea section) tasted really good too! Not your usual tea I suppose. And also look at their bathroom tho, how extra! Lovely cafe, would definitely come back for a chill tea time with friends. People come here with their families too! Salad-loving friends can join the crew too because they also sell salad, it costs 14.9 and if i'm not wrong they have three 'flavours'. They also have other main dishes!","453":"Pastries are so-so, coffee and other drinks just average. So sad that the former roast meat store occupying this space was replaced by a generic cafe.","454":"Cute deco but I dunno how long it will last. Good looks can only go so far. The pastries are alright but they're too sweet and over priced. The staff are really nice but too bad they have a mean lady boss she will say a horrible thing but in a \"nice\" tone, those people are the worst! Good luck!","455":"Newest cafe in the area. Not a bad place to pick up a drink on the way to work. Quick & Easy unlike the other cafes up near Kim Tian.","456":"Whisk is a cozy cafe right in the heart of Tiong Bahru. \u00c2\u00a0The staff are nice and you can tell that the owner\/chef takes a lot of pride in her work. The atmosphere is warm and inviting so it's a nice place to relax with a cup of coffee, but the star of the show are the desserts. \u00c2\u00a0I first tried the cheescake which was amazing... hints of citrus which I quite liked and a smooth, creamy texture. \u00c2\u00a0Another time I tried the carrot cake; now I'm not really a carrot cake person, but this was damn good. Not too sweet with a nice, nutty flavor. \u00c2\u00a0Will definitely go back to try other pastries :)","457":"A very nice little cafe. Great pastries and cakes. A nice cup of coffee. A very modern look and quiet atmosphere. Beautiful food. They staff is very friendly and eager to have you as a customer. I'm told the carrot cake is very good and think I will go back to try it out. The lemon tart was even better than it looked and it looked amazing.","458":"Agreed with all the good comments on this clean cut deco and spacious cafe. The staff was pleasant and knowledgable. Impressed with the nice toilet \u00c2\u00a0and wash basin lay out. It is a good place to chill on a week day afternoon. Think it makes a pleasant place to hold small discussion too.","459":"Guys I almost cried when I saw this food court, it's the most beautiful and harming food court ever.....located in the Shops at Marina Bay Sands.Let me start saying that this food court has such beautiful background music and it the one they use for the attraction called; CANVAS. \u00c2\u00a0I went so many times and each time I approached the food court and start listening to the music I was happy instantly.They have a huge variety of food vendors, all clean, with delicious looking food, and affordable prices.","460":"I've found amazing laksa on the west side!! Love it. I grew up with 328 Katong laksa, which over the years has become more and more commercialised.. This hidden gem at one of Tanglin halt's hawker. Closed on some days but really busy when it's open. Try to get there before 12, otherwise there's usually a line, a line that sometimes run beyond the the edge of the hawker center. The soup is so delicious and rich, and it's really spicy, so be prepared and ask for no Chilli if you can't take spicy. The prawns are peeled, so I love it, \u00c2\u00a0it's so easy to eat! The tau Kwa is soaked in the soup for hours and is so tasty and amazing texture! I love it. If you're a fan of chicken, you can add shredded chicken too. There is $3, $5 or $8; the $3 bowl is really small, like for kids, but great if you're not too hungry. Uncle is so friendly and energetic. He has this signature move where he swirls the soup pot and gets the essence mixed before filling up your bowl. I also love the fat Mee fun, very nice and slurpy. Definitely come visit early! Best laksa around Buona Vista area","461":"I hear mixed reviews about this place. Some rave about it but others think it's only so so... We ordered two bowls - one with chicken and fried tau pok, and another with prawn. Both cost only S$3 each. While the broth is flagrant, it is a bit diluted. But for S$3, they are certainly very generous with their portions of chicken and tau pok. In all, it's good value for money and I will come back again if I'm in the area.","462":"I'm a proud West-sider. I've been eating this laksa for more than 25 years. I remember sitting by the side of a drain, dressed in my Sunday best frilly dress, being so small that my feet couldn't reach the ground... eating a lot of laksa from this guy, and feeling like it was the best thing in the universe.I still think it's the best thing in the universe.I was only introduced to the Katong-style of laksa much later on in life, and while I like it, and appreciate it, I still think this is where it's at.It's rich and intense (he also sells kick-ass prawn noodles), without the overwhelming taste of coconut milk like the ones popularized by the Katong laksa guys.It's deep and tasty.It's cheap and full of good stuff. \u00c2\u00a0You pick from \"No 1 to No 6\", each number bearing a different combination of ingredients. Chicken only. Or chicken and prawn. Or all the works.My favourite laksa in the world... nothing else comes close for me! It's the first thing I eat when I touch down at the airport.","463":"I dont ususally travel out of the east to eat but when I do, this is one of the placest I head to. \u00c2\u00a0The laksa is delicious mix of hot, tangy gravy with springy noodles that comes with chicken or prawns or both if you'd like.The dish has enough heat for me to keep wanting more but thankfully not hot enough to make me douse myself in cold water.Very very good stuff!","464":"Lovely fifty meter competition pools and tasty food at the coffee shop! I enjoyed my outing at the SSC. At the recreation pool, the view was lovely. I enjoyed looking at the facades of the club. I liked the resting shelf along one side of the pool.At the coffee shop, you can enjoy western food and a variety of local favorites. My favorite thing to order is the SDC Club Salad with the Satay Peanut Sauce for a dressing. The salad came with roast beef, hard boiled egg, ham and cheese. It usually comes with a thousand island dressing but I opted for the lovely satay sauce. The sauce is meant for beef and chicken marinated skewers, but I love it it the salad. They also have a fabulous chili sauce and condiment station. They have a prawn belacan that is to die for. The vegetarian version and Hainanese chicken rice chili is good too but the prawn version is my fave.They have a nice Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chicken Biryani, tau pok, Rojak also. I was so happy to be invited to enjoy the SSC. Dad enjoys the billiard room. They have a pretty koi pond, too.","465":"This is a very family oriented country club with families bringing their kids here on weekends to swim, play in the playgrounds or go for classes. It's kind of a more \"fun\" club and I used to come here in my younger years, when my friends and I were bored secondary school kids... They had a bowling hall, cheap arcade (but the games were a bit crap), billiard tables, tennis courts, squash courts... okay the list goes on but we were pretty entertained. I also come here for aikido lessons, and table-tennis lessons. The food at the Chinese restaurant is pretty popular and I also love the CHEESE bun at the mini-food place selling goodies by the swimming pool. Incidentally they have 2 Olympic sized pools , one for training and one for swimming. I love the toilets because they have a really nice jacuzzi and changing facilities. Nice, sports-oriented club.","466":"Soup prepared to the finest taste. Simply love the milky texture and sweet taste after long hours of cooking","467":"Peking Duck is delicious , truffle fried rice and fish must try ! \u00c2\u00a0 Escalopes and veggies are fresh ! \u00c2\u00a0My favorite is side cucumber dish too.Love the pomelo mangoes dessert \u00c2\u00a0! We had a big table but NO ROTATING TRAY ! The service is good . HAPPY to have the toilet on the same floor !Shall be back !","468":"My friends took me to eat dim sum here.Love this place!!! Yummy Pecking duck! Yummy winter melon soup(not on the menu)! Yummy all the different type of dumplings. This restaurant is a keeper!!!","469":"3.5 stars. Upscale 1-michelin star Chinese cuisine in Singapore. We went there for Chinese New Year and went for their Chinese New Year set dinner. Experience was solid good. Food was overall quite good but not spectacular. Favorite dishes were the chicken, Lo Hei, and the fish. Quality of ingredients and excellent and the food was well-cooked but don't' think it was worth the $200\/pax given the lack of wow factor. Set was quite big and we were all stuffed by the end of the meal","470":"Despite the uneven reviews, we went for brunch...and are so glad we did!The building and the entire Cjimes complex are visually appealing and harken back to times long past. The room is well spaced, with a comfortable feeling (see pic).The food was absolutely delicious.We had a half Peking duck which yielded ten little pancakes in which slivers of the skin and meat were nestled. As with most purveyors, the remaining meat was then taken back to the kitchen to turn into a polished fried rice dish (we could have opted for noodles).We also enjoyed:- Roasted crispy pork. These crispy little cubes were absolute heaven! I ordered the same thing later that day at another well known restaurant...no where near as good as these were. I could easily opt for a big plate of these for my last supper- Fried silver fish. If it weren't for their tiny black eyes, you would assume a plate of Mickey D's fries!- Flaky pastry with shredded turnip in a crazily shaped dough- Steamed Shanghainese dumplings (nearly impossible to coral onto the serving spoon or grab with the sticks...you might ask for a fork, particularly if you're in a hurry)- Panfried stuffed red chili, green chili and eggplant ...There was NOT a miss in the bunch!While I feel we were well served, I can appreciate some of the service related comments offered by other yelpers. While hard working, staff could be a bit \"smoother around the edges,\" and interactions were sometimes abrupt. They were constantly ensuring our tea cups were full...if I were a bit more jet lagged I might had minded the frequency. Language was uneven across the staff, such using the wrong word or our needing to repeat..but, again, we really didn't mind.To the contrary one of our many servers was very polished and extremely customer focused, having done a great job. Among a myriad of duties (including rolling a table through the dining room), he was on point for the Peking duck experience!I can only speak to the midday dim sum experience, but we feel this was a home run and a memorable experience...a definite recommend.","471":"Michelin star restaurant #2.The good first:Excellent selection of Cantonese food which you will not find in usual Chinese restaurants. A large dining area which means you can actually get a seat here (as opposed to most 10-15 seater places with stars which are booked out months ahead). Loved the braised pork in chinese wine, and the braised vegetables which included some unknown to me veggies but with excellent texture. Also got the crab dumplings which were ok.The bad:The service wasn't up to the standards I was expecting from a Michelin star place. Very unattentive, not refilling your water, taking forever to give the drinks, also they were not able to explain a lot of the dishes very well.","472":"Very good Chinese food with excellent service.I came here one night for business dinner and really enjoyed their food and service.My business partner pre-ordered dinner so I don't know how much it was but it seemed high end Chinese restaurant.Great selection of wine by bottle, wide variety, it was easy to find what I liked.Everything chosen for me that night was excellent. Peking duck was crisp with great flavor, pork, tofu, soup... all was excellent. I didn't see the menu and the server spoke mostly in Chinese so I didn't quite get the name of food.Service was excellent, she was attentive, served next food just when we were finishing one, kept coming back to pour more wine, changed a plate for each dish served.I likes they prepared two chopsticks, black one is to pick food from shared plate and white one to eat from your plate. It was a pleasant evening with great food. Highly recommend for business dinner.","473":"This place is exquisite! I can definitely understand why it is a Michelin-starred restaurant. It is within walking distance from city hall\/raffles city areas. It is located in a little \"restaurant village\" called the chijmes. The outside area is a beautiful garden theme. You will walk in to an elegant building where they will escort you to your table either downstairs or upstairs. There are very many exotic yet edible sea creatures in tanks stacked in three rows towards the end of the downstairs dining room. The servers are a little familiar with the English language; however, most items in the menu are pictured as well so ordering isn't too bad of a task. Food was wonderful- each dish was refreshingly tasty. They also have an in-house restroom, which is also a perk. I would definitely try this restaurant again!","474":"I had a satisfying meal at Lei Garden in Shanghai just a week ago. Looking forward to experience the same, I brought my family at Lei Garden in Singapore. Unfortunately, i was quite disappointed. Taste is different for the bbq honey pork. Very little serving for the crispy pork. Overpriced fried rice. Only the Chicken in Abalone was the same. The 3-star rating is limited to the dishes we ordered tonight vs same dishes I had in Shanghai.","475":"Good food, in smallish costly portions though. The drinks are pretty good but very expensive. I would give it 4 stars with prices 20% lowerz","476":"Not the best place if you looking for good service. The waiter offered to portion out the fish for our table of 10 diners but he obviously has a problem dividing the portions equally. In the end, the 10th person is left with just a little bit of meat on the fin of a fish.The Longevity noodles, however, was the best I've had. The texture was springy enough and very tasty. It is not too salty. Moist enough, yet not oily. As the dinner was a birthday celebration, I have no complaint on the cost.","477":"Chinese fine dinning, great food, great ambience and great service. This is one of the best place to get great authentic traditional Cantonese food.","478":"Since moving to Singapore, I've been on a quest for the best dim sum in town. I found me 3 girlfriends who share the same passion for steamed dumplings and we've been on a mission since.Our ratings are based on:1) Overall Yumminess (one shouldn't be trekking to a dim sum spot for any one particular dish)2) Ambiance3) ServiceHaving previously lived in HK, Lei Garden has been on the radar so we finally booked last Saturday:Definitely amongst the better har gows and siu mais in town. Far from the best, but sitting comfortably above the mediocre line. Everything arrived promptly, which is always key for two reasons: dim sum ought to be served pipping hot, and more importantly to maximize variety at any given moment.The space was nice enough, a bit tired, but comfortable and pleasant with a nice weekend crowd. The kind of place you could invite fellow yummy mummies or future in-laws to.Service - everyone was friendly and adequate though they didn't give me much else to say about that. Verdict: I've added Lei Gardens to our Return list, which isn't bad considering there are only about 3-4 other places on the list.","479":"Been here a couple of times and i got to say I love the ambience of this place. And along with some good food its a good experience. Service is great as well and I have no complains about this place.","480":"Very expensive and the waiters hassle you to order more food than you will actually eat. I don't get a lot of things about this place, like why people eat little tortillas with only a piece of duck skin inside. If I hadn't been there on business, I wouldn't have gone. The wasabi shrimp were good though.","481":"Michelin star dim sum? Sign me up! The dim sum overall was delicious. The flavors are much more delicate than standard dim sum so you really need to be present to fully enjoy. I highly recommend the crispy pork belly cubes. The service was good...maybe too good? We weren't \"allowed\" to pour our own tea. In one attempt, two staffers ran towards us and grabbed the tea kettle from our hands to pour our tea. I also had an \"encounter\" with a waitress that wouldn't allow me to rest my phone and wallet on the floor, just under my chair (I do this because I'm easily distracted by the constant stream of push messages on my phone. My goal is to put the phone away and to be fully engaged with my friends.) So, how did the waitress resolve this? She brought another chair over and set it besides our table for my phone and wallet to be placed...properly. :) I was tickled by this experience. Overall, highly recommended.","482":"This ranks amongst the top dim sum \/ cantonese cuisine restaurant in Singapore, IMO. Food quality and service is top notch; but what make them stand out amongst the top is the price. Value for money!!!","483":"Great hole in the wall place with air conditioning. We were given a huge menu that was in English and Chinese with photos, which was very convenient. The restaurant is in the Geylang area aka red light district, which becomes obvious when you see signs that the restaurants are open late until 3am or even this 24\/7 dim sum eatery on weekdays. The food is very tasty here. We ordered the crab rice roll, shrimp dumpling, seafood dumpling, deep fried pork feet and smoke bacon steamed egg. We were not disappointed with anything. Just know that you do not come here for impeccable service as this is not that type of establishment. This place currently has 2 locations.","484":"Good twenty four hours dim sum. the drink is in large size and the price is affordable. recommend to try their fried menu.","485":"We were recommended to check this place out by our hotel concierge, and it was about a 10-15 min walk from the Grande Copthorne hotel. We got there at about 8:45 on a Saturday, and the queue was short and moved fast. We sat outside, and they had lots of seating there and inside as well.We didn't have a huge meal - we shared the spicy Nasi Lemak and the Royale burger. Both were awesome! The Nasi Lemak came with this delicious spicy chili sauce which was amazing, and the rice and egg were perfect. The burger was cooked about medium well (we weren't asked), and had an awesome spice\/herb flavor. Topped with grilled onions, Swiss cheese, and an egg. Fabulous. We only had water to drink, but they had lots of juices, etc. to offer. Check it out! Very fast and pleasant service.","486":"When the clock is way past midnight and anyone utters the words, \"late night eats\" I'm always game. In this case, I was the only sober person in our group. Upon learning Spize was a diner-like chain that existed only in Singapore and served a myriad of local specialties, I crammed everyone into a taxi and off we went.The restaurant is a good size; spacious enough for various groups and just enough breathing room to not feel like it was overly cramped. More importantly, the ventilation was on point. Cold enough to dry our sweat, but not enough to chill our food. Singaporean air con is right up there with the best.After 2AM, it was full of young people who were soaking up their alcohol filled night with all sorts of foods. After a small wait, my group and I were seated and the staff was running around just to fulfill orders. Sadly, it meant that there was a longer wait for us than we wanted. After being passed up several times, we had to flag the waiter down just to get our orders in.Once the food arrived, it was decent, but fairly unmemorable in comparison to the local options I've had during my stay. (#1) We had ordered a number of things: nasi goreng ayam, fried beef kway teow, egg + onion roti, along with tall glasses of water. The nasi goreng initially seemed like the winner but it was bland without the hot sauce. The noodles of the kway teow were nice and greasy and the beef was tender enough despite looking overcooked. I want to try other roti combos next time, this one was pretty subpar.It won't be the last time I'm in Singapore and given my track record, I have a feeling I'll be back at a Spize location sooner than later. Hopefully I'll have a better food experience to report.____________(#1) Maybe I just needed to be a tad more drunk. #samelevel","487":"Let's start with the positives. Spize has a massive menu, with a wide array of choices including Asian, Indian, & western. The portions are huge and the price points are very low for Singapore. The decor is also aesthetically pleasing and trendy, with indoor and outdoor seating available.However, the food was nothing to rave about and actually seemed kind of stale, as if it had been sitting out for awhile. Also, the service was very subpar and any request or question was met with a blank stare from the waiters. Service was very slow even though the restaurant was only about half full. Yes if you need something cheap that will satisfy a wide variety of tastes. No if you truly care about good food and service.","488":"Decent drunk food. Not the best but there's a ton of options to satisfy whatever you are feeling. The taste and quality are average but hey, anything tastes good late at night.","489":"Drunk? Sober? There is no bad food here. But there is great food: mutarbak. Might i suggest the mutton?Service can be slow. Accept it. Get a rootbeer float. Be happy and find zen in your time of wait.They also do take out. Order ahead!","490":"Knew this place for a decade. Stayed nearby. Food are great! Got them for dinner and supper. Take away food super convenient. Services were great up till lunch today! First time lunch in here; Served by Mr. R**i aka Store Manager. Main intention to have his opinions for their specialties (trying new stuff). Asked him difference between Magee and Mee goreng. But, his response was \"We have been selling all these food for 13years! Is this ur first time? Where are you from? Most Indo**** order prata... If you order hot water and cold water will be charge $0.60, ok?\" Errrr...... This is store manager we are talking about! I ordered additional food with his staff which is very helpful in giving us his suggestions and TELL us that food pics are the most recommendation. No doubt on food but seriously Mr. R**i?!? Store manager???","491":"Came here on a Tuesday night at around 9pm after having no clue on what to eat and affordable pricing as another factor. After my quick fix of truffle fries elsewhere I came here with my friend.Ordered mee Bandung after wondering what it is. The food came after 10 minutes or so as there were quite a number of people before and after us. The food presentation was colorful and there are quite a few ingredients in it - eggs, cauliflowers, a piece of prawn and chunks of chicken. The sauce is like mee rebus' but added with chilli. It was not thick nor runny so it was perfect with the yellow egg noodle when combined.My friend ordered nasi goreng kampoeng without chilli or chilli sauces. She commented it was alright.For dessert, I tried prata bomb. The prata is sweet and it has two melted sliced cheese on top and a side of curry sauce. Right way to end my late meal :)Mango selaseh was quite good to especially when eating mee Bandung (Perspired a lot). Overall, worth the bucks I'm spending :) Service was still fast and efficient even though crowds were trickling.","492":"I went with a party of 8 and we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered way too much food and most of it was pretty good. Definitely would recommend the summer classico as a drink. I didn't like the weird sandwich cause it was bbq -ish flavored. But the wraps and noodles were really good.","493":"Good food! Dishonest cashier\/staff! Ordered 1 item \u00c2\u00a0each (fried rice, tissue prata, ice cream 1 scoop and 10 sticks satay, warm water, milo) total cost: 51$!!!!Best part was we stood in front of the shop for 10mins none of the staff actually return the extra charges. Word of caution- Be careful on the total bill!","494":"I always order the same 'ol thing here even though the menu spreads across Malay, Indian Muslim, Thai-Chinese & even Western food and happens to open til 6am! Hehe Post-clubbing food, albeit not much hyper-active past midnight activities for me these days. What I like from here is Maggie Mee Goreng THAIII~ You gotta emphasize on the THAI so that they don't give you maggie goreng in RED colour! Plaster prata is a hit or a miss here, sometimes I feel like sending my plaster back so that they could give me a beautiful yolk but they are pretty busy most of the times I visit. One of their nasi goreng is quite delicious, especially with the accompanied samballll. The iced teh limau, which is iced lemon tea and teh halia are pretty good as well. What I dislike from here is probably the smokers' corner and the dust from the road. But guess what? I have been successfully avoiding these two since I found out they have delivery services and satisfied my crazy hunger pangs at 3am! :D I could then sleep soundly without being grouchy. Be minded that the waiting time is approximately an hour.","495":"If I were a man that appreciated irony, I'd find it interesting that I'm always eating halal food in the wee hours of the morning under the influence of alcohol. \u00c2\u00a0Wonder what the prophet has to think about that, although if I had to venture a guess, I'd probably conclude that he isn't a big fan of godless heathens and their drunchies (drunk munchies). \u00c2\u00a0Then again, you have to figure that it's not a bad idea to make money off of wretched infidels while spreading the gospel - so to speak - of delicious halal cuisine. \u00c2\u00a0Anyway, to wit...What we three had:- \u00c2\u00a025 sticks of chicken satay- \u00c2\u00a0Nasi Lemak- \u00c2\u00a0Mutton Murtabak- \u00c2\u00a0An assortment of fresh and exotic juicesEverything was generally tasty, well prepared and came out quickly, which I'm sure is an essential component to keeping drunk and rowdy patrons in check. \u00c2\u00a0Interesting people watching too: \u00c2\u00a0saw all sorts of people mingling which neatly reflects the multicultural aspect of the Lion City.","496":"I passed by this place a bunch of times and it was always packed. Not sure how to label this place. It has all types of cuisines from burgers, pastas, and nasi etc. So I supposed great for a group with particular choices. Basically I feel it's an upscale hawker restaurant. That's not an insult. It's what I hope to get at a hawker stall but never had. Actually hawker stalls are the worst food in sg. It is a bit more expensive than a hawker stall but worth it in the extra execution in the food. Cons- Maybe you find it charming the outdoor eating but you'll also have find charming the sounds of cars whizzing by. I'll try more things here as this is a bang for buck place.","497":"It's kinda amusing to think that I've been coming to Spize for 10 years now. On and off, it's quite near my home making a regular late night supper destination.I'm surprised that the food is so well received because for me it's always been mediocre. But that's not what Spize is about after all. It's not there to be serving you amazing Indian food, it's there to fill you up in the middle of the night after a long day or work or after some frenetic dancing at Zouk. It helps then that they have a wide range of options, so no matter what drunk-munchy craving you have, they've got something that'll probably hit the spot. It says a lot that they're constantly expanding (they just took over the unit next to them), and I expect Spize to be around for many years to come.","498":"Unfortunately one of the the only places you can get food till really late. You're better off getting into a cab and going anywhere else cause the service here sucks. Nobody knows what the hell they are doing and have no idea how long you're food will take. Don't believe it when they say 5-7mins.","499":"Can't beat this place when you have late night munchies from being out all night. I love the Prata. Every inexpensive","500":"If I had a lizard in my mutton maggy goreng that would have been more meat than I got. This place is terrible don't waste your time they will rip you off there are better places out there which are also 24 hours please don't patronize these establishment and expect good service.","501":"Sometimes I wish I could marry food :)Spize is not just a 24 hour food spot it is full on entertainment joining the rest of the pissheads @ 'Wot time is it' AM. \u00c2\u00a0You will be witness to the kind of mayhem normally reserved for a category 3 asylum which may require a change of underpants. More than once here I have laughed so hard my face nearly fell off.The 'go to' on River Valley road when you are shitfaced and, just like a good Sharwarma or Doner, the Roti Prata is going down. Game over man, game over. Comparable to any hawker market but you get to park up and fill your face with a sweet Cheese & Egg or Crayfish filled hot Roti & spicy Chicken curry on the side. Due back here soon and I cannot wait and for those of you who doubt the quality.... try it sober.","502":"To a late night party goer, this is paradise. The most extensive range of late night food you could probably ever find, and when you're tipsy, or tired, or happy, the food will still taste great no matter what. Even sober, the food here doesn't disappoint, and while it's no Tony Roma's or Chilis, but they do offer a great variety of Western and local wares to keep you satisfied.I am a big fan of the fact that they server truffle fries here. Truffle fries! At 3 am in the morning, truffle fries are a godsend. Haha jokes aside, I have seasoned truffle fries connoisseurs tell me that the ones served here aren't half bad at all. Their food options cover the whole spectrum, from your fish'n chips, to prata, they have almost anything you could think of whilst inebriated. Or sober.Here are a couple of the dishes I have tried which are mention worthy and some you should definitely try when visiting Spize. Their roti john chicken special - cheese, mushroom, chicken goodness on bread. Their maggi goreng seafood pattaya - maggi, with seafood and a tinge of orange spicyness wrapped in a hot omelette, nuff said. Their truffle fries - as mentioned above. Their fish and chips - fried crispy goodness with tonnes of fries. Their bangers and mash - good ol' sausages with creamy mashed potatoes and an equally tasty gravy to match. Their nasi goreng - they've got multiple variations of fried rice, be sure to give them all a try. There's a reason why there's more than one type. I could go on but you get the jist. I think the magic in this place is that it comes alive late at night, and is always full of sights and sounds way past midnight. Fantastic for eating those post party blues away. Also fantastic for drunk people watching at 4 am in the morning when you are hungry and cannot go to bed. Their only downside, when it gets crowded, be sure to expect that orders will slip through the cracks, and you may end up waiting for some time before those truffle fries finally arrive at your table.","503":"You can love it or hate it but Spize is a necessary establishment in every party-goers life. If you're done at Zouk and need food, and you probably will, skip the amazingly overpriced food stand outside zouk that serves no purpose but to rip drunk people off. Instead, head straight to Spize which is so nearby, will still be open and has food that tastes good whether or not you're intoxicated. The menu is really extensive, as is the seating. As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options - the usual nasi goreng and mee goreng (both about $4, as there are a few kinds) can all be done veggie style, though you might want to repeat your order a few times to make sure they get it right (this goes for anywhere, really). More favourites are the drinks like ice limau (lime) and longan. The Blue Longan drink is awesome as well. It's basically just processed fruit and colouring, but it's exciting. Because it's blue. Who needs cocktails, right?","504":"I don't think my family ever orders \"just enough\" food. We always over order. I really liked my nasi goreng ayam, the chicken shawarma, the noodle dishes.. lol my bf thought his french fries was spicy but it was the sweet and spicy \"ketchup\" that was giving him a kick. Summer Classico was a super tasty drink. I don't really recommend the Roti John ... it had a weird flavor to it but maybe it's something I'm not used to.","505":"We've been here twice for dinner so far and we've enjoyed the food both times. Our son loves the fish and chips. The menu is large and diverse. We plan to come back to try more.","506":"Amazing food! This place is the go to spot for after drinking as its open late (5 or 6am). I have eaten here on several time during normal dinner times too. Love the Maggie Goreng which a different twist to the normal dish. Must try indian food on the menu :)","507":"I'm from CA and I have to say we have some of the best Indian food. Came to Singapore expecting some bomb Indian food since Indian is one of the major ethnicity...only to be disappointed. My search for tasty Indian food has been disappointing...until I found Spize.Whether it be a night after drinking or a random meal, Spize has been one of the most delicious Indian food I have ever had. That Mutton pancake thing with the dipping curry is so freaking amazing. To be honest, I have yet to try the other dishes but if it's anything like that, i'm excited to try more of the dishes. Not much to say about service, just standard. I mean if anything the food came out a pretty good time considering how busy and drunk customers there was. haha.The environment I usually go to is post clubbing\/Zouk so there's not much to say about it. Just drunk Singaporeans! haha.My search for good Indian food in Singapore will continue but at least I have Spize!","508":"So many people in Singapore drone on and on about the fact that Spize serves up prata inferior to other outlets. I am not disputing this. But every place has its own utility and its own niche. Spize covers the \"post-clubbing drunk-crowd\" niche. And it's a great niche to cover because, let's face it, when you're drunk you could probably pick up a yoghurt-lid slathered in bird shit off the ground and devour it as if it were three-star Michelin fare. Hooray for drunks!I will admit that I'm drunk almost every time I come here. And I come here a lot. It's basically a ritual. I don't care that there are other late night options in Singapore, such as Geylang and what have you. What I want late at night after drinking is prata + teh tarik and Spize is the most dependable and easily accessible option. The food is pretty good guys, come on. And you get to be in the company of your fellow drunks and party goers. Always fun! We even get the benefit of fairly dim lighting so that we don't have to be subjected to the seemingly rapid deterioration of our fellow patrons under harsh fluorescent lighting (exacerbated by our impending sobriety).By the way, even though I order the exact same thing every time I come (cheese egg prata and teh tarik less sweet), I have been very pleasantly surprised by the crayfish. Try the crayfish!","509":"Once was a real treat and well worth going out of your way. Now the service is terrible, the prices are double, food is not as good, and it looks like a fast food chain restaurant.","510":"oh spize. sweet giver of life. how you have revived my soul on numerous debauchery-laden nights. i'm a sucker for getting murtabak here. i don't even know what this food tastes like while sober, but if i'm to trust drunken me, which i do (he has excellent taste), then this place needs a michelin star (jk).but what spize giveth, spize taketh. the double edged sword cuts both ways, and cuts deep. beware of the spize induced shits, which haunted me during my hangover last week.","511":"I think I've been here all of twice sober and it's definitely quite mediocre generally. That being said, Spize is an absolute post-clubbing institution and there are few better places when hammered.I usually go for prata and\/or nasi goreng and washed down with milo dinosaur\/100 plus (my favourite hangover prevention drink). It's always packed around 4-5am on weekends but it's so massive you can usually get a table easily. Service is also surprisingly efficient given the crowd. (In that it's not too hard to order)","512":"Wanted to check this place out because there is always a line. It seems like people like this because it is open late. I got the roti john special and the chicken curry. I would recommend getting the roti john special, it is very flavorful and enjoyed the sauces that come with it. The online app to order is super easy as well.","513":"Am here writing this review right now and though the food has yet to arrive I have to admit that in the opening 10min the restaurant deserves no more than 1 star. The attitude of the very first staff we approached put us off and the 2nd, well... all but killed our dinner. Having been a service trainer for years past, seeing staff faces frown when I asked simply for an extra cup is appalling. Food has been served but so what? Sadly, your serves means more.....","514":"Its cheap and cheerful. \u00c2\u00a0Good food at ridiculously low prices!I have tried their chicken and cheese murtabak, mutton murtabak, chicken biryani (warning on the spice level!), roti, and the dessert with crispy crepe, bananas and ice cream.I've never tried their western food though -- I will probably go to a western restaurant if I want western food.Its usually full so expect to wait to be seated.Service is average -- and orders can slip when they are full. \u00c2\u00a0Manage expectations -- don't expect 5-star service if you are paying less than $10 per dish.BTW, this is a halal restaurant so definitely no alcohol served.","515":"Spize is really popular as a post clubbing eating place because of it's proximity to Zouk. If you're in town area, it tends to be one of the first places that comes to mind. The food comes in pretty huge portions and is satisfyingly greasy. I would say the out-of-the-wok dishes like kway teow goreng, mee goreng etc are pretty good but the prata not so. The roti john is pretty good. Drawbacks: the prices are pretty steep for an Indian-Muslim place (probably because of it's location) and parking is problematic. A lot people just park illegally on the street because there just aren't enough parking lots. But if you're coming here post drinking, you shouldn't be driving anyway!","516":"Spize is another one of those post party supper places people flock to in the middle of the night. This place is open till late, and can get crowded over the weekend. There's a HUGE variety of dishes to pick from, so you'd be spoilt for choice. They have all kinds of pratas, both sweet and savoury, as well as murtabaks to choose from. I like the mutton and cheese murtabak. It's huge and stuffed with ingredients.Rice or noodles? Take your pick. Most of the fried rice or noodle dishes here are pretty standard. Satay here is decent, but pricier than most other hawker centres. In fact, all the local dishes here cost a little more than average.There's also a western menu available, but I've never tried any of those dishes. Neither have my friends, so I can't really comment on that.The toilets here are usually filthy, and the floor is really oily. Tread carefully, especially if you are inebriated. They set up rows of tables and chairs on the walkway outside their shop, and the next 3 shops on either side.Parking around here is a real pain when you've got the post-party crowd in. Most people park on the streets illegally. Watch out for drunk people crossing the road as well, as some of them park on the little streets across the road from Spize.","517":"Spize is one of our default places for supper after a night out or just when we're really hungry after midnight and most other places are shut.For something I usually go for the tissue prata and a cup of hot teh halia. We've also tried the nasi goreng pattaya which is not bad, as well as some hot plate dishes like crayfish, sliced fish, egg tofu and sup kambing. Everything was OK although the sup kambing not as good as the ones in Malaysia albeit less oily. The murtabaks are generally decent. The drinks ie the Milo Dinosaur are pretty good.They also do delivery.","518":"The Waffle House of Singapore, if your out late, you'll probably eat anything. \u00c2\u00a0Decent food for the hungry late at night","519":"This is your go-to supper place after a night of drinking and party at Zouk. That is if you still have the energy to walk there. The menu is rather extensive, the massive outdoor seating occupies most of the uniquely wide sidewalk of the area. Most revelers often come by to this place because it opens till the wee hours of the night and early morning. Most of the dishes is somewhat palatable but it is definitely not a food destination in itself. But when push comes to shove, I suppose anything would do at 4am in the morning. Though I have to say that they've got a generous portion of iced drinks, that, I gotta give it to them.","520":"A slightly grotty establishment that has been around ever since I can remember, this 24-hour prata place along River Valley Road is always teeming with youngsters, even at five in the morning. There is nothing better after a night out clubbing at Zouk (just around the corner) than a piping hot and extremely unhealthy banana-chocolate prata (seriously, try it) and a teh-o-eis limau (sweet iced tea with lime). No matter about the occasional cockroach scuttling amongst the tired crowd of semi-drunk party-goers, the prata is tasty and the drinks are good and sweet. Spize is where you go for a post-party chow down.","521":"My first time at Spize was enjoyable. On one occasion we ordered delivery and I remember lifting the clear container of special stir-fry and seeing my mushrooms and snap peas swimming in an inch of oil. After consuming my food I remember biking home and giving birth to my dinner from my oral cavity in the stairwell to my apartment complex. My roommate came home an hour later and said, \"dude, someone threw up near the elevators\".","522":"I think the quality of your review depends on how drunk you were when eating here. \u00c2\u00a0The first few times I got it as delivery and it was decent but a little pricey for delivery food. Another time I ate after clubbing and it was AWESOME. \u00c2\u00a0So keep that in mind. Its got good, reliable food. \u00c2\u00a0As people say it gets busy on the weekend nights. \u00c2\u00a0I never tried the western food but have always liked the roti prata, curry chicken, pineapple fried rice, etc. They have a pretty extensive menu which is nice. \u00c2\u00a0Definitely a good spot to absorb whatever alcohol is in your stomach after a busy night out.","523":"There is really only 1 thing that I'll eat at 4am after a night of debauchery, and that is Spize!!!!!Spize lah!!!!!Maggi Noodle Seafood. \u00c2\u00a0It makes you feel like you are Harold and Kumar and you just made it to White Castle. \u00c2\u00a0You can't sleep after a night at a club unless you eat Maggi Noodle Seafood.","524":"Great food and even better service. Don't doubt yourself if you're planning to dine here.","525":"Tried everything loved everything. Best place for every cooked warm dishes that you could ever crave for. This place is heavenly. Waiters are very helpful and always want to make you feel comfortable and welcome and at home. Mix of both young and old crowd and very very consistent high quality in food. Have never been disappointed even once. This place will go far! Thank you!","526":"Spize is the perfect post clubbing spot. I know my fellow reviewers say that its the perfect post-Zouk clubbing spot, but honestly, I know for a fact that revellers from Mink and Butter come to this perennial popular supper spot for food too. Food wise, Spize has an extensive menu. It serves local classics like prata and roti john. Portions are pretty sizeable - which might not be the best idea if you're going directly to bed after this, but it sure helps in soaking up alcohol. Some drawbacks to Spize though are its spotty service, and the non-existent parking available. But considering the location, I think you'll be hard pressed to do better.","527":"since 24 hr mr prata is undergoing renovation, best to come here for a late night snack. \u00c2\u00a0shared some tasty paper masala dosa, roti john, mi goreng pattaya, etc. with teh tarik. \u00c2\u00a0all that starch to help knock you out. \u00c2\u00a0outdoor seating, spicy food, many stalls next to each other.","528":"The Bottom Line: Good quality and decent service make this a great place for lunch.Pro:The ramen here is pretty good. It was savory, with a good balance of ingredients, and generous, too. The service was fine.Con:None that stood out. The restaurant, food, and experience were just fine.","529":"Glistening caramelized char siew.. with so much smokiness and flavor from the fats. My most favorite place for char siew islandwide!Their hakka noodles are pretty good too, pairs well with the charsiew and siobak. However, my champion for siobak is still HK 88 Roasts at Foch Road. But the one here is also pretty good. Roast Paradise also has a few other outlet locations, including Lau Pa Sat.","530":"The roasted pork here is both perfectly tender yet has a textbook crisp on the outside. I don't know how they do it! It's a must have if you're at the Old Airport Road Food Center. It's a good amount for one person for a light lunch, but it's also great if you want to share with someone and still have room to order other items.","531":"Serious love affair with char siew and this place is da bomb in Old Airport Road hawker centre. The roast pork sometimes sell out early but anyways, the char siew is the frontman of the show.It comes in a chunk, with a little burnt roast taste that is smokey and flavourful. The meat is soft and there is a thin layer of fat (not a lot) there to give a umami fat flavour.I would complain that their fragrant rice seem a little less but it's so good as well. Must-try!","532":"For the Roast pork was good not wow. \u00c2\u00a0The HK style Char Shao was pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0Sweet, salty with a tinch of charness. \u00c2\u00a0At 5 per combo plate not too bad.","533":"My dad and I had lunch here the other day. The stall seems to be popular and more people queued up after we got our food. They sell roasted pig and char siew (aka roasted BBQ pork) over rice or egg noodles. The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions were just right.","534":"Genuine Italian staff, great terrace for an al fresco dinner.Don't miss the awesome Pumpkin Mac & Cheese which actually comes in a real pumpkin.","535":"Nice spot but the food disappoints.I'm not terribly calibrated in Italian food in Singapore - so maybe this above average? But unfortunately I found the food lacking. The mozzarella wasn't something to write home about and the pastas were also uninspiring. The place itself \u00c2\u00a0was llively though - it backs onto a spacious and quaint patio, which I is truly lovely. Inside the space is slick but not too slick. Service is great.","536":"WIthout a doubt, the best pumpkin mac and cheese I have ever had. I know Latteria is known for their cheese and this was incredibly full of flavor- the pumpkin with exactly the perfect texture to both serve as your bowl (and keep your food warm!) as well as consume. It's what I like to assume is the best balance of carbs and veggies ;)Admittedly, service was a bit spotty, but not enough to deter me from enjoying my experience. I've only been here once and that too alone and thus didn't go crazy with all their offerings, but definitely do plan on returning and trying their infamous burrata!","537":"Ambience: really lovely placed nestled on Duxton hill. Wonderful place to hangout and chill with friends. There's indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is really lovely as there's a backdrop of the cbd dotting the nightline.Food: reviewing the few foods that we ordered. 1) linguine crab and mascarpone: really love concoction and the pasta was very flavourful. Loved the generous portions of crab meat in the sauce as well. Recommended.2) grilled whole Seabass: really lovely huge portion of the fish that was extremely fresh. Cooked to perfection. Recommended.3)grilled beef sirloin: not as fantastic. Ordered it medium rare but it appeared well done. However excellent service on that the staff immediately changed the dish without question. Taste was ok though not that good.Not recommended.","538":"Consistently good! \u00c2\u00a0I have been here a few times over the last couple of years and never once walked away disappointed. Of course, all the mozzarellas are to try. And the pastas using mozzarella too, like oven baked pasta. Will be back for more!","539":"Went there just for the dessert, had the Tiramisu and Panna Cotta. Panna Cotta was not even set properly was way too liquidy. The tiramisu was a good cake but not a tiramisu by any stretch, hardly any coffee or liquor flavor and no ladies fingers as well. Only good thing was that portions were pretty good.","540":"I still sweat at the memory of my lunch in the lovely courtyard of this restaurant. It's no fault of the location, because who sits outdoors in the midday sun on one of the hottest days of the year unless you're trying to get a tan or an expat?! While that choice did not make things better, the real reason the meal was extremely average was the overall taste of all the dishes. Of all the items that we ordered, there were two hits and two complete misses. To clarify, I came here for the set lunches which are 25++ for starter, main and tea or coffee. The setting is reminiscent of a cafe by a cobblestone paved street in France and it was one of those days where I needed the peace the memory invoked. The price is fairly reasonable for the quantity. The burratina in the salad showed promise (it does say 'mozzarella bar') but the truffle oil with chickpeas soup was a complete disappointment. It's partly my fault for not asking what kind of chickpea soup but that combination was atrocious and oddly bland coupled with my dislike for truffle. The leaves were a bit old but nothing criminal. Then came my sliced beef main - rather well done, but with disappointing roast potatoes and a tasteless salad as sides. The second main was the fresh pasta, bolognaise, a very salty and overpowering dish that felt too heavy after the first few bites. The coffee and tea at the end was just average, not artisanal or anything.If you're expecting finer cuisine like I was, given the venue and prices, I think you might be left disappointed. However, I've heard the dinners are far better so perhaps I'd change my review some day.","541":"Revisited latteria mozzarella after a long time and they wowed me again with the really impressive service and the delicious food! Had the burratina with roasted pumpkin and truffle and our knowledgable and extremely helpful server added Parma ham to the mix to satisfy my sweet and savory craving! Best decision ever! I still can't get over how fresh the cheeses are. Garlic prawns were great though overshadowed by the cheese starter. Fantastic crab linguine in a pink sauce which is as good as Valentino's. I will definitely be back for more cheeses!","542":"For more reviews and pictures, visit my blog.This 90-seater semi-alfresco restaurant has taken over the now-defunct Britsh gastropub The Jackson Plan, and the menu revolves around 11 variations of fresh mozzarella, each served with a contrasting side ($20-30). These creamy and milky bundles of joy are imported twice weekly from Italy.Frankly, a mozzarella bar sounds kinda intimidating even for a cheese lover like i am but there are non raw dairy dishes available as well. Our couple friend invited us along for their Restaurant Week booking. For $35, we had a 4 course meal from their actual menu. Here is what we ate.Our starter of Crab & Stracciatella Cheese Salad with Roasted Zucchini ($20). I love the shredded rags of cow's milk mozzarella and fresh cream. It is delightfully rich but not too heavy. The crab meat lent a light and fresh seafood sweetness to the mix and i love the juicy roasted zucchinis at the base of the tower. The red wine balsamic reduction lifted the dish with the slightly bitter sweet acidity. Nicely done.Next up, the Smoked Scamorza & Porcini Mushrooms Risotto ($25). Smoked Scamorza has a more dominant in taste than the mozzarella and i like how its natural saltiness flavored the risotto cream broth. I would say this is more of a wet risotto but it's nicely executed nonetheless. Would be a good dish to share.I was surprised at the size of the Grilled Beef Sirloin Steak Tagliata with Rucola & Truffle Sauce ($35). This is a full size steak, grilled simply and served on rockets. The steak was tender and done medium rare like we like it. Love the truffle sauce too. I could hardly finish my dishes.For desserts, it was the Lemon Panna Cotta with Balsamic Strawberries ($15). The pudding is slightly more curdled and firm but i love the thick milky smooth texture which is perfumed by the refreshing lemon. This is a match made in heaven. (No picture because the lighting is pretty bad and i think using the flash is rude.)Enjoy their 3 course weekday set lunch at only $28++. You don't have to wait till Restaurant Week to do that.","543":"Overall pretty tasty.Lacked cheese on something or other.Can't finish the review since it was so long ago. Just going with the star rating I originally went with.They served bread with olive oil, authentic Mediterranean style of aperitif.","544":"Cheese does a body good.Or at least it tastes really good.One of the best cheeses out there is well made mozzarella. \u00c2\u00a0It's most delicious forms are melted and oozing over a savory dish or in a burrata or stracciatella form when it is paired with fruity olive oils, nuts, and a rich fruit.Latteria does mozzarella right and it's fresh and cooked forms are solid.The food:I've gone with a large group and sampled most of the cheeses. They are all wonderful, but I love the classic and well executed flavors of the bufala with sweet cherry tomatoes and basil and the savory stracciatella with roast zucchini. \u00c2\u00a0There is a great variety of mozzarellas available as well as beautiful pairings with a few kinds of sweet roasted vegetables or savory oils or meats. \u00c2\u00a0Their main courses are also well executed and the lamb shank is consistently tender while the pastas are cooked al dente with generous helpings of sauce (I've had lasagne and the weekend brunch pasta with cream sauce - YUM!) \u00c2\u00a0Finally their desserts don't disappoint and I love that Sunday brunch comes with 3 different kinds (mmm the smooth panna cotta may be my favorite!) Indulge away!If you're looking for a delicious Italian meal with a heavy skew towards cheese, you definitely have to eat at Latteria! \u00c2\u00a0They also have one of the best Sunday brunches around with generous family style helpings of cheese, pasta, steak and dessert!","545":"Visited in a large group of 9 people. The mozzarella was probably the best I've eaten even though I've been to Italy! The pasta was rich, creamy and quite heavy. Definitely recommend sticking to the mozzarella entrees, especially the smoked options and the exemplary Stracciatella and Burratina.","546":"another restaurant week date!apparently, restaurant week menu is only available to those who make advance reservations.so i'm one of the privileged ones entitled to order from that specially priced menu.at a price point of $35, i think i now understand why. you get crab & stracciatella cheese salad with roast zucchini to start.little rags of cheese on top, layered with crab paste in the middle and roasted zucchini forms the base.very nicely plated and worked well together.then you get the smoked scamorza and porcini mushroom risotto.a very distinctive almost caramel like background taste of the smoked scamorza combined together with the porcini mushrooms.the risotto was nicely al dente.the tiger prawns with chick pea cream was selected as the main.a generous 8 whole pieces of medium sized sauteed prawns sitting in the middle of a chick pea cream bath without a strong middle eastern taste.for sweets, you get a lemon panna cotta with balsamic strawberries.lovely, light and well balanced in sweetness with a hint of sour notes. finally, you get a coffee or tea to complete your meal.and their coffee was power!almost artisan standards.as usual, i ordered some ala carte dishes instead of 2 restaurant week sets.to start i had their Burrata, Sweet Peppers Peperonata.it is a huge portion, so it is definitely a sharing dish!nice creamy mountain of fresh burrata sitting on a confit of peppers.the ala carte main i ordered was the Grilled Pork 'Spiral' Sausage, Porcini & Truffle.by this time, i was stuffed.nice meaty sausages, all three of them, stuffed with peppers.the truffle though was not distinctively tasted though.again a big portion, definitely good for sharing.service was very attentive and efficient.you can choose their outdoor patio seating but it's not fully sheltered from the elements.some guests actually moved indoors when it started to rain.oh for an italian salute, their prosecco was a clear choice, dry and full of bubbly","547":"We had a really enjoyable Friday night dinner here. Duxton is a nice chill out area that is not crazy busy. Plus after a whole day of rain, the weather was at a nice cool 24 degrees, perfect for outdoor dining!Menu is not big. Love places where they just focus on what they do well. As the name suggest, this is a mozzarella bar, so this cheese is featured on a whole page of the menu.We started with two types: one wrapped around truffle, arugula and prosciutto. Beautiful. How do you go wrong with a combination like that. The mozzarella goes well with the saltiness of the ham and the bitterness of the leaves..and you are spoilt further with black truffles. Genius.The second one we had was a creamier mozzarella served on top of a bed of grilled zucchini. Delish too as this mozzarella has a much richer taste and texture. A great contrast to the first. We can't decide which one we like better.Main course we had the special of the day: a wagyu beef steak. Done perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside and lightly pink inside. Meat was succulent and moist with a great bite.The second main course is the spaghetti with mussels in a white wine sauce. On first mouth, I thought it was a tad salty. But the sweetness of the seafood broth with lots of garlic and white wine came through as you eat. Their spaghetti is very thin, even thinner than the usual linguine. Almost like an angel hair. Done al dente. Very nice.We ended the meal with dessert. Lemon panda cotta with strawberries in balsamic reduction. The panda cotta is not sweet like some places and really smooth. Yum too.Service was great as we were served by Kirby who recommended everything. After the two appetizers, we basically told him to just get us what he likes most from the menu for the rest of our meal and we ended up leaving very happy.","548":"Also here for Restaurant Week, was pretty packed on Friday for lunch! Unfortunately, no more spaces indoors (or, not much, anyway). Outdoors is pretty, but it's really hot and the fans helped alleviate the heat only slightly. It was a little tougher to get the attention of the servers outside, but as more people sat down that wasn't as bad. I think al fresco in the evening would be really nice though! Lovely setting with the shophouses behind.I was starving by the time we got there (long walk from office :p) and so was very thankful for the bread + olive oil\/balsamic vinegar (although somehow I couldn't get at much of the balsamic vinegar :( think it had sunk beneath the oil!). Piping hot from the oven and deliciously crisp on the outside, warm on the inside, and fluffy!!! I love their bread.Both of us had the restaurant week menu. Pan-fried buffalo milk mozzarella wrapped in parma ham. 3 mozzarella balls! Very nice presentation. Parma ham wrapped around each ball with some herbs sprinkled on top, with some rocket and cherry tomato wedge in each little compartment of the 3-part dish. I found the ham a bit slightly (but never really like ham anyway), balsamic reduction that came with was sweet and hence a good foil! I chose the seafood cacciucco while bf had the lambshank. Lamb was tender, falling off the bone with a prod of the fork. Delicious sauce! He said he could taste the cream\/butter in the mashed potatoes. I actually didn't find the cacciucco remarkable, but again I don't really have anything much to compare it to. Nice tomato-y broth, light, fair amount of seafood (clams, fish, prawns, squid, all well cooked, not too tough or anything). Two thin slices of toast (rosemary\/sea salt sprinkled, I think?) and of course, I mopped up the soup with the rest of the delicious bread!Dessert - red wine pear with mascarpone mousse and chocolate shavings. Delicious! A tad on the sweet side, but nicely poached pear and mousse went together well.","549":"I found this place while trying to figure out where Entrecote was. Four of us came for the $24-ish set lunch--fantastic value as you get 3 courses for your money. Unfortunately (but understandably) there's only one mozzarella dish in all the options, but the entire menu is open to you if you feel like burata at lunch time (or any time!). Between us we got to try most of the mains--the fish was good. And the tiramisu, ZOMG Definitely worth coming back at dinner time!","550":"Had a great dinner at Latteria tonight. Their burrata and other mozzerellas are definitely worth the trip. We had the classic burrata and the stracciatella with roasted zucchini, and I could've been happy with just those two cheeses and some bread. But on top of that, we also had eggplant parmigiana, which I thought was actually a little too heavy on the cheese and too light on the eggplant. The flavor was still good, though. Finally, for the entree we shared the roast lamb shanks, which were tasty and tender, if a little gamey - but I think lamb shank is pretty much always gamey, right?Aside from the food, the service was knowledgable, fast, and friendly. The lighting and ambiance inside are nice, but something about the acoustics make it really noisy for the size and number of people in that space. That's fine though if you're going in a large group, family style, which is what I'd recommend anyway.","551":"I'm not entirely sure how authentically Italian the food here is. I mean mac & cheese inside a pumpkin? Come on guys. I guess I'd be impressed with the innovation if I liked pumpkin. Unfortunately I hate it. But I do love mac & cheese and with some careful fork work I was able to avoid the vile orange stuff it was enclosed in.Everything else we ordered was delicious. The crab linguine wasn't quite as awesome as my favourite at Kith Cafe but was still pretty great. Probably a little too much sauce smothering, it rendered the dish less than delicate.I also really liked the lamb and the risotto. Add this to the wonderful al fresco vibe on Duxton Hill and this is definitely a restaurant you should try. A word of warning: the indoor dining room can get very very loud.","552":"We found out from a friend that Latteria has a daily $28 3-course lunch special, so we finally decided to walk over and check it out. \u00c2\u00a0For the longest time, we were rather intimidated by the idea of $20 mozzarella after living in NYC with easy access to the affordable and incomparable Arthur Avenue mozz.Sunday lunch was a pleasant surprise. \u00c2\u00a0The service was top notch with a lot of useful recommendations. \u00c2\u00a0We had a lovely stracciatella arancini in a beautiful gravy for our starter followed by entrees of tiger prawns and veal scallopini. \u00c2\u00a0Lunch was capped off with a lovely and very creamy tiramisu. \u00c2\u00a0We enjoyed some nice bellinis (real peach puree!) along with our meal.Throughout the meal, we had excellent and attentive service.PARTING THOUGHT: Don't miss the bread. \u00c2\u00a0They may add some corn meal to the dough, which gives it a lovely fragrance. \u00c2\u00a0It was served warm and crusty with nice balsamic and olive oil.","553":"I love this section of Duxton Hill because it reminds me of Europe, what with the cobble-stoned road and lush trees lining each side of it. The one thing that makes it unmistakably Singaporean are the beautifully restored shophouses. It's definitely a great retreat from the increasingly busy Tanjong Pagar stretch, and there is a good selection of restaurants here.Latteria is a fairly new addition and took over Jackson's Plan, which means they have that great outdoor garden space, and they've done a good job in making it cosy, well-lit and generally very pretty at night. The interiors are inspired, too, and they have unique light fixtures and beautiful furniture.They serve Italian cuisine with a focus on mozarella - it appears in lots of the entrees. There's a good variety of options to choose from, and the food is not bad at all. Worth a shot, and definitely try to get a table in their beautiful al fresco dining area!","554":"Firstly, I'm not a cheese fan so wasn't really impressed with the food. However, I can relate to why many people love these place. Menu is not overwhelming but that's good because you know they are focused on what they are passionate about.Overall dinning experience was pleasant. I loved the simple ambiance and friendly service. Meal was heavy (thanks to the mozzarellas) and felt well served. Wouldn't mind coming back again but definitely not on a weekly basis......","555":"We had a fantastic meal with great service on a lovely Wednesday evening, and all because the first place we went didn't have a table until 10:30! Linsel was our waiter and he was kind and gracious. We ordered the burratini with pumpkin appetizer, lamb shank, special tagliatelle with pork cheek, and tiramisu. All were delicious. We sat outside and the setting was lovely. Probably our favorite meal during our two week stay in Singapore.","556":"We affectionately call this place FoMo (short for Faux Mozza). Like the famous Mozza at Marina Bay Sands, this place features a mozeralla bar with tons of cheese selections. But unilke Mozza, the prices are very very reasonable, and the portions are huge and meant to be shared.We really like the burrata and other cheese features. Sometimes their condiments aren't very classic pairings, but the quality of the cheese and the amount more than make up for it. The mains are also good, the hanger steak is awesome.I'm docking one point for the pastas. They taste like they're out of the box, and not the classic Italian taste -- overflavored, oversalted, and not fresh pasta. But they give you a huge amount.","557":"I set the bar pretty high for Italian restaurants so you can take this with a grain of salt, but I thought this place was pretty unremarkable. I'll start with what I liked about it. The manager (owner?) was was friendly and engaging, greeting us at the table and taking our orders. One of the dishes we ordered was gnocchi in a truffle sauce. The sauce was very good: \u00c2\u00a0flavorful but not heavy. And the serving sizes were satisfying. Now the bad. 1) Service was friendly (I always appreciate that), but terrible. There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, so it took a long time to get served, we had to ask for things multiple times because he kept forgetting, and some things never came at all. 2) I don't often say this, but the gnocchi was too firm. Almost rubbery. 3) I ordered the squash risotto, and found it completely flavorless and a bit chalky. 4) Worst of all, we ordered two mozzarella dishes and they tasted like Philadelphia cream cheese. I realize we're a long way from Naples, but that is not the kind of quality I expected from a self-proclaimed \"Mozzarella bar\". 5) Oh, and it was crazy loud. I'm not sure why they decided that metal sheeting was a good way to decorate the ceilings, but don't come here expecting a quiet, romantic dining experience.","558":"Great alfresco dining area, very good value down to earth but high quality Italian food! For those who appreciate casual settings with a happening vibe and reasonable prices. A real gem!","559":"I have travelled all Over the world but never expected to find in Singapore the most amazing Mozzarella I have ever eaten! Do your self a favor and eat here. Fact!","560":"I went there yesterday night, four of us we sat in the terrace.I LOVED the mozzarella. We had the Burratina, Roast Pumpkin & Truffle and the Sfoglia, Prosciutto, Truffle, Rucola. These two there definitely the highlights of the evening. SPLENDID. The burratina was soft, juicy, milky, creamy... a dream. The Sfoglia... I mean how can you go wrong with the truffle and prosciutto!We all had pasta. All were great even though not as outstanding as the mozzarella.Linguine Vongole & Porcini - probably the best out of the 3, Olive oil based, vongole were great.Spaghetti Sardi, Bottarga AOP - good but not enough bottarga (grey mullet dried eggs, resembles the taiwanese oh hi ji' or the dried mullet roe. Olive oil based, could use more bottarga to my taste but it is quite strong...Linguine Crab & Mascarpone - a little too creamy for my taste but goodFor desert we had the Tiramisu - excellent and BIGWine-wise, I did not like the Chianti (but I never do) I still ended up with \u00c2\u00a0it through because I liked the Primitivo even less (strong but drops dead in your mouth) and the last one that's available by the glass was out of stock.I will definitely go again and I might just have mozzarella only!","561":"Love the food and ambience. \u00c2\u00a0Very chilled and unpretentious - great\/ non intrusive service, simple yet delicious Italian food. \u00c2\u00a0The burata will keep you going back. \u00c2\u00a0We had the seabass (whole fish and very fresh) and crab linguine (very delicious!) and dessert is on the scale of big - good to share. \u00c2\u00a0Much recommended for date nights, afternoon brunch with kids or group dinner...","562":"Love this place. It has everything you would want in the perfect restaurant. Great service, great ambience, wonderful food, tasty desserts, just perfect!!","563":"Tasty but not sure about how authentic the Italian food is. Love the seafood pasta and lava cake. Nice ambience. With some appetizers and wine, you can expect to spend about 60-75 per person on average for dinner, which will allow you to eat about 15 meals in Hawker center, but I'd say it's still worth the money.","564":"I had a sublime mac and cheese entree, served in a baked pumpkin shell for a bit of vegetable virtue. I would go back again just to eat this because, while the other vegetarian menu items sounded alright, the mac and cheese was very unique and special and something I have not seen before in Singapore. Flavor and portion-wise, \u00c2\u00a0the $25 price is justified.","565":"Good God, there's a lot of great food options down here.Had the Nyonya Laksa from East Coast Lagoon. Broth was an umami explosion with a rich shrimp base. The combination of fried crunchy something - probably pig skin - and chewy noodles was awesome.Also noticed a Ramen Nagi with no line!!! Have never seen that happen in the SF Bay Area.","566":"The food courts overseas just blast the ones in the states out of the water. Good selection of variety of foods to fill that tummy from all the walking. I had the Indonesian cuisine and it was pretty good, especially the curry chicken with white rice and choice of 2 veggies. Option of green chili and hot sauces in the front. You cant beat it for $7.80Seating is good and no need to bus your own table because the staff comes around to get your plates.","567":"What a cool Asian food court in the ION shopping center. \u00c2\u00a0I noted Asian because I didn't notice any non-Asian vendors in this specifically named section on level B4 with a antique car prop at the entrance. Many vendors were freshly cooking food for potential and actual patrons. \u00c2\u00a0Some vendors even had machines prepping food (Japanese skewers). \u00c2\u00a0As such,.it was a show just watching them prepare their food. \u00c2\u00a0We tried various soups, roasted duck, pork, and dessert dishes with most getting thumbs up from our party. \u00c2\u00a0Place is very busy during lunch and an open table can be hard to find especially if you are a large group. \u00c2\u00a0This food court puts our shopping center food courts in the US to shame. \u00c2\u00a0Wierd thing is that there is no napkins or paper towels.","568":"With so many choices I rate it so highly. In addition there was plenty of seating at the various hours I had stopped by throughout my stay. Some of the other food areas like this either didn't have enough seating or as much variety as this one. Another bonus is that they stream classical music and occasionally a little mild opera if you listened closely through the bustle of the crowds. They really have everything you could possibly want to eat in the area from salads, desserts, roasted duck, noodles, soups and just about any Asian cuisine you could imagine.","569":"We wandered in here for dinner on our 1st in Singapore. Overwhelmed and excitedly stimulated by the varied Asian food options. The dining area is like a Disneyland cafeteria. \u00c2\u00a0Petite seniors moving quickly to clear the table after you leave. We saw people who got off work with take out in nice clear plastic containers. Sadly, contributing to trash if they don't reuse. They only seem to recycle paper in Singapore and we were told not plastic. Trash is hauled off to another island. \u00c2\u00a0Please help the environment and eat in if you can. We tried 3 dishes at the Chinatown street food section. Stir-fried veggie, Singapore rice noodle, both very good. The beef fried rice tasted bland to me. The meal came with a bowl of tasty broth for each of us. Prices reasonable about $7 SD each plate.","570":"Food opera is pretty darn amazing. \u00c2\u00a0Located in the basement level of ION Orchard, there is plenty of seating even on the weekends when the malls are super crowded. \u00c2\u00a0It's so clean. \u00c2\u00a0Employees constantly walking around to clean off tables and carts also being pushed around if you want to buy additional beverages if you're already sitting at your table. \u00c2\u00a0Food Opera is your mall food court but on steroids. \u00c2\u00a0Filled with a plethora of food choices from sweet to savory. \u00c2\u00a0Juice bar, coffee, dessert, laska, hainese chicken rice, noodles...you name it they've got it. \u00c2\u00a0I think there has to be something here to satisfy ones taste buds for sure. \u00c2\u00a0Food opera I love you you're wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0If you're shopping on Orchard definitely stop by Food Opera for a meal!","571":"If you're looking for relief away from the sweltering heat that is Singapore everyday and delicious food, look no further than Food Opera. This is a food court located in the B4 level of ION Orchard Mall. The comfort from the air conditioning here comes at a cost - the food is more expensive. But, it's worth it because we do have some winners that are worth trying. The first food item was their laksa. Next to the Chinatown Complex Hawker Center, the laksa served here is my second favorite in Singapore. It's less creamy than its hawker center counterpart, but the flavor was still just as intense. Notes of coconut, shrimp, lemongrass came through wonderfully. I ate this laksa twice during my trip. One because I really wanted AC, and two I love, love, love laksa. My cholesterol levels were definitely not good coming back home from this trip. Lol. The second food item was their BBQ grilled chicken. Whoowee, this was so delicious! You can actually see them grilling the chicken wings over an open charcoal flame, and that flavor just gets absorbed into this chicken. The wings were smoky and had a wonderful char. The skin was crispy and it was still juicy in the middle. But, the wings were quite small, and one order was expensive (like $1 per wing). The third food item was their Teochew fish balls in soup. The fish was fresh, pounded into a paste, and boiled into fish balls. The quality was definitely there. Great texture and flavor. Plus they had very hot chilis in soy sauce as a condiment. Spicy as hell. We tried other food and drink items here, but they weren't good enough to be mentioned. Maybe an honorable mention would be their ayam penyet. Definitely not as tasty compared to the one at Tekka Center, but the chili sauce coating the chicken was definitely tasty. I just wished the chicken didn't taste like thick fried batter on the outside and unseasoned chicken on the inside. I still think this was one of the better food courts to come to that served good food in the comforts of a mall. Give this food court a go. At least you won't be sweating like a dog here.","572":"I first heard about this mall food court from watching the Fung Bros' YouTube video. Food Opera is located in the basement of the ION Orchard mall. The nearest MRT station to get here is MRT Orchard station which runs on the \"North South\" (RED) Line. There's plentiful of food options at Food Opera. We browsed around the food stalls before making a choice.Stalls that we tried:-Stall #5 \"Li Xin Teochew Fish Ball Noodle\": I got the fish balls with egg noodles (5.50 SGD). They offer a few variety of noodle choices and I picked egg noodles. It was pretty good and filling.-Stall #6 \"Ice Shop\": My dad and I shared the grass jelly dessert and there were a few toppings (3.30 SGD). There were red beans, tofu pudding, and mochi balls. Delicious and refreshing treat.-My dad got the chicken and rice set which included a small plate of stir-fry Chinese broccoli and soup. I don't know what stall it was from and I think his meal costs (5-7 SGD).We came during lunch time and it wasn't crowded when we arrived. The food court was getting busy when we left since office workers and tourist would dine here during lunch. So, I recommend coming here by 12:30pm.","573":"Food Opera is RIDICULOUS. Ridiculously GOOD. Head-spinning GOOD. Food Opera puts American mall food courts to SHAME. Food Opera has a bewildering number of food stalls to gawk at and drool over. Not only do they have all these wonderful food stalls, they have the little ladies pushing DIM SUM carts. I swear, I thought I died and went to Yelp heaven. Like all Yelpers, I eat to Yelp and Yelp to eat. Singapore HAS to be Yelper heaven, because delicious food is EVERYWHERE. And then Food Opera...where do I even start?Oh, I started at Lam's Signature and ordered the Abalone Noodles. It came topped with egg, pork, fishball and a skewer of abalone & scallop. You get to choose your noodles - I had no idea what to get and had the cashier choose for me. Whatever it was, it was hella tasty.Next stop was a juice bar...called Juice Bar. They make fresh juices. I ordered what the person before me ordered: the lime which nicely complemented my meal.My hubby had Hainanese chicken from Sergeant Hainanese Chicken Rice. I think he enjoyed it. I never got a chance to snap a pic of his dish.I love you, Food Opera.","574":"Amazing. So many choices. Decided to go for something cold after walking all over the place so I stopped at the Ice Shop. Ice topped with durian fruit and adzuki beans...yum! ($3.80SD$) I was told the chicken rice and prawn noodles are also amazing here so I may need to come back. Probably a bit fancier than most food stall are but this is at Ion so probably tone expected.","575":"Avoid this place if possible...except for perhaps a fruit juice or Kopi or Teh. I stumbled upon Food Opera after 10:00 pm on a Saturday - \"shop until you drop\" was an understatement for me this day. I had bags in both hands from Pull and Bear, and Lovissa, to Mango and ZARA; I was famished. Thankfully, there were still a few vendors serving patrons. I ordered the seafood Char Kway Teow from Thye Hong - Singapore Fried Prawn Noodle. This was an inexpensive meal at SGD $6.80 (about US $5.00). Unfortunately, in this case I got what I paid for. The Char Kway Teow just wasn't good. On a positive note, this is a very nice and clean food court with ample seating. I wish food courts in the US looked like this. It's a great way to take a break from all of shopping you're sure to do at ION.I knew the food wouldn't be as good as hawker food such as Lau Pau Sat or Maxwell St., but this stop was purely out of convenience. Next time, I'll just continue my stroll down Orchard or Patterson an take my chances on street food vendors. There was a pizza vendor that looked really good; the deep dish made me salivate. Worse case scenario - the McDonald's is always open!","576":"Many selection of great food. Place is clean and big but a bit tight by the seating area. Got the Mee Pork to satisfy my craving, portion is on the smaller side.","577":"I've stayed at the hotel across the street several times and made the ION Food Opera my main place for quick bites since it's so conveniently located near the Orchard MRT.I love the variety of dishes that are available-- everything from hainanese chicken and rice to laksa to hoikken prawn noodles to fresh fruit... you name it. It's definitely more upscale and cleaner than most hawker centres and each place takes credit cards and debit cards so it makes it easier for everyone if you don't carry much Singaporean currency on you.","578":"This is, for now, the best food court on Orchard Road. Some of the stalls have been famous for several generations (eg. Lam's abalone noodles, HwaHeng beef noodles, ThyeHong carrot cake), best in class (eg. Ah Chew Yong Tau Foo) or just very good (Indonesian chicken BBQ, HK roast meat). There's diversity too, you even find Korean or Bak Kut Teh. But, strangely enough, no Indian, Japanese or Vietnamese (there was a good Vi\u00c3\u00aat when the mall first opened, but it disappeared). But those who crave ph or b\u00c3\u00a1nh m\u00c3\u00ac tht can walk to Nam Nam in the basement of Wheelock Place next door. Quite clean, with lots of roaming cleaners, and a sink for guests to use.","579":"By far the best food court in Singapore! There isn't a single place that you can go wrong. Whether in the mood for spicy noodles or a fresh squeezed lime juice, there is an option for everyone. Baby friendly and very friendly staff. Highly recommend and will definitely be back next time we are in Singapore!","580":"In the busy shop infested ION the food option is the Food Opera (FO), a concoction of \"pricy cheap\" eats, but, compared to home much better quality. \u00c2\u00a0I began my food journey in Singapore here. \u00c2\u00a0FO had my head spinning like an exorcist baby in a candy store! \u00c2\u00a0All the choices and visuals (love the giraffe and horsey animal statues scattered about). \u00c2\u00a0I found myself in a choice panic. \u00c2\u00a0Should I have congee? Or Laksa? Fish ball noodle soup? \u00c2\u00a0But wait! \u00c2\u00a0Do I want something chill like Ice Kaching? \u00c2\u00a0Or roast pork? \u00c2\u00a0What's hungry man like me to do?!!!I wish I had this problem at home in the US!After thinking hard. The floating soy sauce with red pepper floating next to the cash register at 3rd Generation Laksa won my attention. \u00c2\u00a0I immediately realized my painful 15 hour flight to Singapore was worth the suffering.While I cannot say it's the best Laksa in Singapore or the best prices ($S7 for a large bowl) this type of flavor and quality is nowhere to be found where I live in California. \u00c2\u00a0I love the energy and vibe of FO. \u00c2\u00a0It's fun to watch other people walking aimlessly and unsure of what to eat or the workers or those seated and what they chose to eat.I also tried the Rojak (spelling?) salad which composed of cool vegetables, fried doughnut (bread used in congee\/jook), pineapple mixed with crushed dry nuts. \u00c2\u00a0I thought it was too sweet but it was refreshing.As an encore, I had in iced Kaching w\/Ice Cream for $S3.80 (maybe $3US?). \u00c2\u00a0It was very refreshing with the shaved iced mixed with red beans and some kind of red jelly thingy. This dessert is located at a stand in the FO called \"The ice Shop.\"Word of warning, although there is good quality here, there may be better options elsewhere at other hawker centers. \u00c2\u00a0This is just the beginning of my food journey here so I will use the FO as a barometer for other places. \u00c2\u00a0Needless to say, I ate so much here that I was able to walk and shop for about 7 hours. \u00c2\u00a0I've also had the Fishball noodle soup which is pretty decent too. \u00c2\u00a0It's at the \u00c2\u00a0Teochew Fishball Noodle Stall.","581":"Great food court with all kinds of regional Oriental foods represented (Chinese, Malaysian, Indonesian,Thai). \u00c2\u00a0Didn't see any Indian, Japanese, or Korean in this food court, but they are in others. \u00c2\u00a0Ate here twice and was not disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0Great food at bargain prices, which means huge crowd of diners. \u00c2\u00a0Lots of seating but you have to be patient to find unoccupied spaced.","582":"In our first night in Singapore, we stopped by this food court in the B4 level of the ION Orchard shopping center. Not wanting to go out very far for food once we checked into the Marriott (literally right across the street via the underpass and MRT station), we got our first meals here. Compared to the food courts in the US, this place was incredible in terms of variety and quality, so much so that you'll need 15 minutes just to walk around the area to see what you want to eat. We went with some Singapore standbys:Chicken and rice: chicken was very moist, and love the chicken flavor of the rice itselfChar kway tow: nice stir-fried taste in the noodlesHokkien mee: ok, but I wish it wasn't so watery or soupyAll in all we spent about 30 SGD (22 USD) on our first meal. While you can probably get better, cheaper food elsewhere, it is also nice to have a convenient and air-conditioned place to eat. Remember to bring your own paper towels and wet knaps.","583":"Love it from the first taste and it did not disappoint. \u00c2\u00a0The beef noodles is again my favourite. \u00c2\u00a0Tried the hokkien prawn noodle and it taste traditional. \u00c2\u00a0Prawn flavour lingers over the noodle gravy and the noodles readily absorb the richness within it. \u00c2\u00a0Prawn is not shelled at all, arghhh! Would hv been better if the flavour is richer. \u00c2\u00a0More prawns? The pork noodles was a let down. \u00c2\u00a0No texture in the noodles and I did not enjoy eating it. Well. .... too much food this time round. \u00c2\u00a0Well try again.","584":"FOOD: VERY GOOD The prawn noodles were really good! The soup was thick & packed with flavor. The prawns were really big and juicy. The meat was also tender but slightly salty! It was a really big bowl as well so very filling & hearty.PRICE: OKAY It was $5.50 for my bowl of noodles & for the amount i got its rather worth it to me because it was filled nearly to the brim! WAITING TIME: SLIGHTLY LONGThe cashier was talking away so dragged the waiting time but it was worth it for the food was really good for a food court. ATMOSPHERE: CROWDED It was peak hour during lunch so the place was pretty cramped and it took awhile to find seats.","585":"There are quite a few complaints here about steep prices. Of course they're higher than the food centers, the rent in this mall must be exorbitant! Who's going to offer cheap hawkers food in a modern megamall? Nobody. So if you want to pay a lesser price for the same thing, go travel to your closest eating centre and get it there. But for those who like the convenience in a very clean, spacious, and air-conned space, This place is hard to beat. The variety is simply amazing.","586":"I am really not a fan of Food Opera and have actually vow never to dine here unless absolutely necessary. I am torn between giving it a 1-star (which I really want) or 2-star (just because not all stalls are bad). The goodIt is really hard to think of something good here, though I guess it is pretty spacious (but gets filled up real quick) and looks clean with some art pieces scattered around. The not-so-goodGenerally very high prices for local street food. You can definitely get much better local food at lower prices in the usual food centers or coffee shops. But in the Orchard Road shopping belt, the choices are limited, unless you trek to Lucky Plaza, Cuppage Plaza, Far East Plaza or Orchard Towers and even Ming Arcade (really cheap and good nasi padang) for much more affordable local street food fares. Even though the stalls are supposedly the best, I am sure many will beg to differ. Somehow when the food is no longer cooked by the original owners, the standard is not the same. So you are paying close to $10 for something you can get for $3.50-$5 in the Orchard area or $2.50-$4 in the neighborhood area. The absolute worstOver-charging by not following the prices listed on the board. The worst offender is the stall selling nasi padang (Malay food). It has happened to me twice!When I asked about it, the staff just said \"oh the price listed is wrong, they just increased it\". This happened a few years ago. Recently I ordered from Luk Yu Teahouse (dim sum and Chinese dishes) stall. The prices listed are not also accurate as GST is not included. Now you know in Singapore, most prices include GST, or if it doesn't, it is always stated exclusive of GST. So I got a rude shock when the bill was not what I thought it would be. And this was for take-away. Although the amount is small, I just do not think it is right. After all, it is about the principle. So I guess I will go back to not dining there again, unless I really have no other options.","587":"Very busy food court in the afternoon. \u00c2\u00a0Not sure what to order so I went for the longest line with workers! \u00c2\u00a0 I'm sure there are more authentic dish out there but it's a great place to get out of the heat!","588":"Very clean and upscale feeling food court with some popular Western options like Dunkin Donuts or Auntie Anns. But that's not why you came to Singapore, I hope. Nice local food options like fish ball soup, chicken rice, fried carrot cake etc. Add to that mix Hong Kong dim sum, pizza and burgers, so there is something for everyone. Some of the vendors provide free samples, like the cream puffs place in the center. Thr biggest challenge you'll have is to pick what you want.","589":"Great selections of different kind of cuisines,can get crowded and busy during the lunch hour crowd. come early and you will surely find a seat. The trays seemed to be unsanitized. The older amahs in charge of collecting the dirty plates and trays seemed to be unfazed by this. They use the same piece of cloth to wipe down the tables and the trays.","590":"I am reviewing Food Opera as a tourist.I really think Food Opera is great if one has limited time like myself and want to experience as much of Singapore food as possible.It is so easy to get to and all tourists will end up at ION. The selections here is good as almost all the most popular hawkers are here. Set up is clean and great to come here during summer because of the air conditioning!I know it might be a little more pricey and might not be the real hawker centre experience. But for me the food here beats anything I have at home!","591":"How aptly named! It was singing in both sound and sense. We had a lovely meal. Try it for lunch since evening dining can be seriously overwhelming.","592":"It'ex expensive for the same type of food you can get in hawker centres and other types of food stalls. Most of the places I have gone to sells the same dishes for about $4 while here all the food is is $7+. The crappiest part is that the food isn't even great. It's merely passable.Unfortunately, this place is convenient, clean and nice, and has a large variety of food to select from. I got the balastier bak kut teh at first and was extremely unimpressed with it (altho one must note that i've not tried the real stuff on balastier road so i'm not comparing to that one). The meat was chewy and the flavour did not go through to the meat. I've had a different version of this that was way better. I ended up still hungry and went to another stall to get some dimsum, but it was also not impressive. The dimsum is old and overcooked from having sat in the steamer for too long. The flavour was on the side of bland.Nevertheless, overall, the place is okay. Convenience, choice and cleanliness brings it up a notch from a two star.","593":"Nice food court! Finding a seat is a pain in the arse if you come during peak meal time, but the selection is fantastic and we had an amazing plate of char siu, roast pig, roast duck, roast chicken and BBQ sausage. It was huge and satisfying with a bowl of rice. Go there hungry and you won't be disappointed.","594":"If you're looking for an accessible food court exiting Orchard station, then ION is within reach. Head for the escalator near Rubi and you'll be at the Opera in a blink. This posh-ly designed food court is full of options to suit your current craving.When I came here for the first time, I was amazed and in love with the chandelier and seating. Then with my succeeding visits, It feels cluttered. Especially with the crowd. I love their food selection here but with the layout of the place, it's really difficult to find vacant seating unless you look really close. When in a food court-a crowded one at that-it's a must for any alone person to be able to see a vacant seat so they can quickly chope it.With their food selections, it is definitely an \"A\". But with the layout, referring to convenience, it's on shaky ground.","595":"Clean, Endless Options, Overwhelming:Super convenient to the Singapore Marriott via underground tunnel. \u00c2\u00a0We chose Gyoza-Ya (B4-56 ION). \u00c2\u00a0Goyza were perfectly cooked, crispy yet soft; paired with a variety of accompaniments. \u00c2\u00a0Friendly and helpful staff with tablets for ordering; quick service. \u00c2\u00a0Favorite was the garlic fried rice that was flavorful yet simple with egg and scallions. \u00c2\u00a0Huge cup of hot green tea made the meal complete. \u00c2\u00a0Low-key meal and exciting environment make this a place I'd go again. \u00c2\u00a0Upon return I may not feel as over-whelmed as the first.","596":"This is a food court in a mall. \u00c2\u00a0Compared to the food courts in the US this is considered restaurant food. \u00c2\u00a0 I got kind of overwhelmed with the selection of food. \u00c2\u00a0I decided on hainan chicken and a milk tea place. \u00c2\u00a0 My friends got pho and skewers. All where really good, and the place was kept pretty clean. \u00c2\u00a0My only complaint was the air conditioning unit. \u00c2\u00a0It was dripping water above us, so we had to move. I wish i had more time to try everything in the food court.","597":"Right under the ION Orchard shopping center. A very clean food center with many choices. One of the best in town if you are not cultured enough to go to the street vendor type food centers. I am a fan!","598":"Food Republic chain of food courts, in my opinion, is quite a rip-off.I do agree that the bread talk group is trying their very best to make food court dining classier, but i don't agree in paying a minimum of 7 dollars for food court dining. I don't find that placing a metal giraffe art piece in the food court helps in the layout of the place, especially during the crowded lunch hourI must say that their food selection beats the other food court operators - popular hawkers are sourced.One thing I absolutely hate in this food court is that their drinks are limited to only Pepsi and Yeo's. Absolutely no Coca Cola or Pokka selections, and the drinks are overpriced.","599":"This place is pretty, the food is okay, but the extra dollars we're forking out for the slightly fancier packaging just affects the foundations of 'hawker food'. The only stall (if they are allowed to be called that) that I patronise often is the Soy Milk Vendor, which serves up a good quality tau huey zuey (soy milk), and the sugar often comes separate. Besides that, I'd recommend a train ride to Tanjong Pagar or Tiong Bahru for a more wholesome experience.","600":"A lot of food selection. Sometimes a challenge finding a seat. Good food.","601":"Food Opera is a food court strategically located at the basement of ION Orchard, housing many local favorites, such as fried carrot cake, laksa, prawn noodles, ice kachang, dim sum, etc. The theme of the food court has an interesting twist, as it attempts to combine art and local food. It is a pretty nice place to dine in, if not for the cleaners who are full of angst. They make the environment a little less comfortable to dine in. Also, the food is a little too overpriced. They don't even taste as good as they look! Try not to settle for your meal here, unless left with no other choice!","602":"Dian Xiao Er has an earlybird special during lunch for the first 10 tables between 11:30am and 12:30pm and dinner from 5:30pm to 6:30pm also for the first 10 tables. \u00c2\u00a0The discount is 15% off your bill and valid for dine-in only.My party of 3 was probably the 2nd or 3rd table to arrive on a weekday and the place was obviously basically empty. \u00c2\u00a0The space is quite open and there is plenty of space for larger groups from what I can remember. \u00c2\u00a0Service is good.The three of us shared the following:Duck roasted w\/Angelica Herb \u00c2\u00a0- duck was tender and flavor was good, but I think I prefer regular ol' Peking duck, sadly.Poached Spinach w Century & Salted Eggs - yum! \u00c2\u00a0Loved the century\/salted eggs. \u00c2\u00a0Though I'm not a huge fan of cooked spinach, the flavor was nice and the spinach was not soggy.Claypot Frog & Jumbo Prawns Bee Hoon w Chinese Wine - very, very flavorful and satisfying seafood broth.Hong Kong Style Steamed Fish Slices - yay for easy eating and no bones! \u00c2\u00a0This is your standard steamed fish with soy sauce base. \u00c2\u00a0Fish is tender and not overcooked.Dian Xiao Er is a nice place for a relaxing, tasty lunch if you work nearby and need a nice little break from your desk.","603":"First time I visited this store was about 10 years ago. I went back about 2 months ago, the food quality remains very good. I only went there by myself tonight. I am very impressed that the have a herbal duck with rice, the portion just enough for a person and then I have ordered a soup of the day - Lotus with pork bones and peanuts. Both were good. The herbal duck was very tasty, the skin is crispy and the sauce covered the meat. The soup also good, not oily and lots of ingredients inside. Service was good and efficient, price is reasonable. Overall, very enjoyable dinner, will go back again.","604":"Excellent tempura dishes with just the right amount of batter and fresh ingredients. I enjoy sitting at the counter as it completes the experience. The set lunches are good value albeit on the expensive side - this is at the Regent!Service has been uniformly excellent and attentive.","605":"Haven't been here for a long long time. Tempura is still good.Looks like the prices are lower, not cheaper. Less tempura at lower prices. Highest lunch set is $75. Just enough food.This set has prawns with prawn heads, vegetables and fish. Also comes with a bowl of rice with chopped up prawns and a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds.Still a good meal after all these years.Tempura here is lightly coated with batter so you can taste the food and not just the batter.","606":"I have never tried the full tempura course in Tenshin but I am a big fan of their special tendon donburi. It's basically donburi served with a tempura of prawn, anago, maitake mushroom (dat umami!) and prawn kakiage. I'm a fan of simple dish done well and Tenshin achieves just that.","607":"Specialises in Tempura. The batter is just right with pretty good service.","608":"I'm half chiu chow. So does this give me absolute authority or 1\/2 authority regarding this bowl of noodle absolutely not. Just merely speaking for my own taste buds. They offer 3 different sizes, but all in one option. Fishball noodles your choice of spicy or non. Each bowl is served with noodles and two fishballs. If you're looking for more fish balls you would need to order Fishball soup on the side. Same price of $3\/4\/6 sm\/med\/lrg.I love Fishball noodles and this by far one of the best bowl I've had. Fishball jiggly and spring. Awesome chew in every bite. Broth was excellent. Already miss it and if you love noodles it's a must.","609":"Ah Ter is one of my favourite stall in Singapore. This is traditional teochew fish balls and mushroom minced meat noodle at its best.I opted for a small fish ball noodle soup ($4). The broth was clear, flavourful without being overpowering. This must be what angel's tears taste like. The steaming hot broth was filled with mouthwatering handmade fish balls, fish dumplings, minced meat and fish paste slices. Chewy silver needle noodle with sweet savory hot sauce mixture is absolutely addictive! It's impossible to not fall in love with Ah Ter!","610":"Delicious minced pork noodles on a rainy day!The cook is very friendly and I noticed that he's deliberate at his cooking even though he must have done it a few thousand times! Still he's careful and focused on his work. The result, yummy dried noodles with sufficient ingredients to accompany it. A must go-to when you want good value for money yummy food.","611":"This is my favorite fishball noodle in Singapore! The Yewu Mee is so good and flavorful and delicious. The fishball is so good and you really can't get better fishball than A Ter Fishball noodles. I would highly recommend A Ter Fishball noodles to anybody","612":"I'm a huge fan of this stall! \u00c2\u00a0Especially the dry mee poh. \u00c2\u00a0The soup version is just as good. \u00c2\u00a0Lots of flavor and ingredients. \u00c2\u00a0Long lines so do go early. \u00c2\u00a0Highly recommended.","613":"I really would've liked to have given this place 5-stars; however, I left with quite the upset stomach. I'm not sure if it's because I ate too quickly or there was something funky in my serving, but I was not feeling too well afterwards. The servings are incredibly generous and fairly well priced. The atmosphere is authentic to a tee, and all of the attention is put on the food. My friend ordered the rice plate and absolutely loved it, while I got the dosa masala, which was also very good. Both come with healthy portions of various sauces (the names of which escape me). I'm not blaming the restaurant for my upset stomach because this is my second visit and I thoroughly enjoyed the food the first time round without the unfortunate side effects. The food is all vegetarian as well which is a nice change. For desert, do consider picking up a ring or two of the Orange jelly looking desert in the middle of the counter at the back of the shop.","614":"Was an alright breakfast of idli. I've had fluffier rice flour steamed wonders in Sunnyvale, CA.I was the only non-brown person in there for the morning! Can't help noticing.","615":"There are several different restaurants bearing the name Komala Vilas. The original storefront on Serangoon, another on Race Course Road, both owned by cousins descended two generations (I think) from the founder. \u00c2\u00a0 There's even a kind of fast-food chain, Komalas, which was started by another cousin, complete with a mascot that looks like a rolled up newspaper but we are given to understand it's a friendly and welcoming dosai (I've called him Mr. Dosai.) \u00c2\u00a0I've tried them all, and they're all quite good. \u00c2\u00a0But I have my biases, and I must say that the tiny little shop on Buffalo Road is the very best of them all. \u00c2\u00a0The rice meals (, thali) are simply divine. Three courses of sauces - sambar, kozhumbu, rasam - followed by curd and the sweet payasam are served piping hot and are simply delicious. \u00c2\u00a0Their vegetables -- Kooththu, poriyal, pachchadi - are always as fresh and delicious as can be. \u00c2\u00a0And unlike some places, they'll keep filling your plate up with all the rice and veggies you can eat. \u00c2\u00a0Napping is highly recommended after one of these, so plan your day carefully.Of course the tiffin - itlis, dosai, poori, chapati - are also wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0I've had them all there, but I'm quite partial to their ven (savory) pongal. \u00c2\u00a0End with coffee and you can't go wrong.Family friendly, as most such south Indian restaurants are, bring the whole clan to Komala Vilas on Buffalo Rd. \u00c2\u00a0And, as they say, yenjay!","616":"Good basic food, inexpensive and plentiful. I had a rice plate that consisted of papadum, rice, okra, green beans and paneer, squash, sambar, eggplant curry, dal, raita, yogurt, chapati, and tapioca. It was all good and only 8.50 for the meal.","617":"Really good South Indian food at very low price. The place is not so clean. Otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.","618":"Very authentic Indian restaurant - price per value is unbeatable in Singapore.","619":"Reached out to a local friend when I knew we would be heading back to Sing for another trip and he suggested we check out No 3 Crab Delicacy for chili crab. \u00c2\u00a0Since this was going to be a short trip, we planned on having a late lunch here only to realize they close in the afternoon right before dinner. \u00c2\u00a0Not exactly sure their hours but be warned to check their hours before making the trek out to this place. \u00c2\u00a0Also, they are now located on the ground floor of the Link hotel and not on Outram Road (basically around the block). \u00c2\u00a0We were the first patrons of the night and the restaurant did seem a bit dead as we were eating. \u00c2\u00a0Not sure if it was just an off night or if business just wasn't good anymore. \u00c2\u00a0I was urged to try the rajak chicken along with their chili crab. \u00c2\u00a0Wasn't sure what to expect with the rajak chicken but it was pretty tasty. \u00c2\u00a0A perfectly fried thigh of chicken was topped with a sweet\/sour\/savory sauce with cucumber and some sort of fruit on top. \u00c2\u00a0Wasn't a big fan of the sauce as the initial bite did have a strong fish sauce flavor but the more I ate, the more I ended up enjoying it. \u00c2\u00a0The crab here was also pretty good just wished the sauce had a bit more kick to it. \u00c2\u00a0You will definitely need to order man tou or some sort of noodles to truly enjoy the chili crab sauce.Overall a decent meal that it wasn't \u00c2\u00a0exactly Hawker food stall prices. \u00c2\u00a0A nice local restaurant but the wife did say the sauce for the chili crab was slightly different than from what she remembers. \u00c2\u00a0There are tons of restaurants that specialize in chili crab so not sure I'll be back any time soon.","620":"All crab lovers... you will love this place.It is not cheap however, and can easily come up to $50-$60 per person. Get the crab bee hoon. No finger bowls but they have paper napkins.Sometimes I wonder how honest they are about the weight of the crabs. I wish I could bring a weight scale and weight the crabs myself. Seems like a couple of famous people have visited this place too.","621":"It's been ages since I visited No. 3 Crab Delicacy Seafood Restaurant so I was thrilled to be able to return for a fix last evening. As we were planning to visit another restaurant after this, we only ordered 2 dishes - both of which are my favourite ones here. We started the meal with a large plate of Drunken Cockles (S$20 \/ US$14.67). The juicy raw \u00c2\u00a0cockles had been cured in soy sauce, Chinese wine, garlic and topped with some fresh chili padi (Thai chili). The copious amount of minced garlic imparted a lovely flavour to the dish but doesn't make for a good dish to indulge in if you're on a first date. Another signature dish here is the Curry Crab in Claypot. Even though it's been a long time since I ate here, the rich, creamy curry gravy was as good as I remembered. The flavourful gravy was a perfect complement to the smooth strands of boiled Beehoon (rice vermicelli). The medium-sized Sri Lankan Crab was succulent and so big, it was almost spilling out of the claypot! The Crab dish set us back by S$ 75.40 (US$ 55.28) before 7% GST & 10% service charge. The beehoon is priced at $5 (US$ 3.67) per plate, which though pricey is worth a splurge to be able to fully appreciate the flavourful curry gravy. If you stop by here and have a decent tolerance for spice, do order the Drunken Cockles and Sri Lankan Crab Curry.","622":"I went to Singapore because I wanted to eat hainan chicken rice and CHILI CRAB!!This restaurant wasn't too far from the hotel so we walked here.Ordered chili crab, bun tou, fried crispy baby squid, sambal slipper lobster, veggies and clams.My favorite dish was the crispy baby squid. \u00c2\u00a0Omgosh it was so good I wanted to eat the whole plate by myself. \u00c2\u00a0I am not a fan of clams but I like the clams from this place.The other dishes (including chili crab) were not that good.3 stars!!","623":"It is was my first visit to Singapore and was told about their famous Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0I was very impressed with 3- Crab Delicacy's menu and food preparation. Their Chili Crab is excellent. \u00c2\u00a0It is located along Tiong Bahru where there are many attractive restaurants next to it. The female owner had mentioned that they had just moved to Tiong Bahru a month ago. \u00c2\u00a0The cost for the Chili Crab runs around $48 but was worth every cent.","624":"I have been here 4-6 times in last 3 years. \u00c2\u00a0Each time a friend from overseas comes to visit and wants to try the famous Singaporean chili crab, I take them here. \u00c2\u00a0Why? \u00c2\u00a0This place has the best chili crab in entire Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0No Signboard? \u00c2\u00a0Jumbo? \u00c2\u00a0Seriously?I have been to Jumbo three times and No Signboard twice and they can't stack up against this place and their buns...mmm...and crab meat fried rice...and to make things even better, a lot cheaper than those over-priced two: No Signboard and Jumbo. And since they do use live crabs, the meat doesn't stick to the shell (I heard this somewhere whether it's true or not) and crabs are big!Anyway, I love this place and I will continue to come here each time I have guests visiting","625":"Come here for MASSIVE crabs from Sri Lanka..... Personally I prefer them as they are much easier to consume; usually crab is a 90% work and 10% actually eating for me. Sauces were excellent; we had the chili and butter variety. For both the sauces were savory and tasty with crab or simply on rice. Plenty of other nice dishes as well; I liked everything they put in front of me!Great for groups.... Plenty of large round tables.Simple d\u00c3\u00a9cor, fine service.Good value, we paid about $45\/person for 2 HUGE crabs, plenty of entrees and drinks. \u00c2\u00a0Probably ordered too much as we had leftovers.....Really enjoyed the meal here, so far my favorite crab in Singapore! Would definitely come back.","626":"Forget those tourist traps like Lau Pa Sat or Newton Circus - this is THE place to go for huge crabs. I'm saying like the size of your face huge. Hidden away on a side street by Outram, it's easy to miss this restaurant among the various other zhi char stores nearby, so do come prepared with directions in hand. Open all the way from 11.30am to 11.30pm, many old regulars living in the area drop by for late night indulgences in their signature crab dishes, and I've seen many order crab to go as well. Their top selling dish is obviously the chilli crab, but if you're tired of the usual like me, do try their Butter Crab. It's served drenched in a thick creamy butter sauce, and lightly seasoned with crushed garlic for a plate of steaming fresh delicious seafood. The sauce is also lighter than the spicy chilli or heavy black pepper taste, so it's easier to allow the natural freshness of the crab to be picked up by your palette. This means you can actually appreciate the crab meat and not just the sauces. Their fried Man Tou (buns) are no joke either, dig in while they're hot to enjoy the crispy brown surface and steaming white insides. Dipping it in any of the sauces from the crab dishes just makes them a hundred times better! Price can range from about $30 to $50 per person if a large group for 4 - 6 are sharing 2 crabs, which is definitely more than enough!","627":"Not very good crab (tried black pepper and chili). Not a great price. Very weird ambiance (or lack thereof).","628":"Couldn't wait to go back after first visits in 2013....still the same delicious ginormous crabs prepared to order with various sauces and spiced to your specifications. Great with the little buns and the spinach side dish. A little bit off the beaten path for tourists so you will be among mainly locals. Plan on about $50 per person....worth it!","629":"Went to this place because it was recommended by a website. \u00c2\u00a0Big mistake. \u00c2\u00a0There were lots of pieces of shell in the chili and the food was not worth the cost. \u00c2\u00a0At the end of the meal, we were charged 50 cents for each napkin that we used and for \"peanuts\" that we did not order. \u00c2\u00a0This restaurant seems to be a rip off.","630":"We are crab eater and instantly knew the crab was not fresh. \u00c2\u00a0I wanted to buy my parents a good dinner, but my mom was disappointed that I spent the money.","631":"There were a variety of dishes to choose from! The restaurant was clean and the staff was attentive. Make sure to designate enough time so you can enjoy all the different entrees, appetizers, desserts, and drinks. We went during breakfast and although there is a lot of seating available it got really busy around 9ish so I recommend going as soon as the place opens in the morning to avoid the rush. My favorite was the noodle bar and the juice bar! They also have a special seafood buffet during sunday brunch that looked spectacular! Must try next time I am there.","632":"Located at the Conrad Centennial Singapore, Oscar's is an all day restaurant which serves as the full breakfast buffet option as an alternative to the lighter executive lounge breakfast offerings for Hilton elite members. There are plenty of Asian and western options, including stations for breads, cereal, cooked to order eggs, meats, fruits, pancakes, waffles, pastries, yogurt, gluten free items, and fresh juices. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly, offering juice and caffeinated drinks. None of the breakfast options jumped out as great to me, but did the job of filling your stomach. I found all the juice options unpalatable including the weird tasting orange juice and specialty juices at the juice station (no juices need that much ginger in them). The restaurant is very popular for breakfast and there always seems to be a line to get seated, but the hosts do a terrific job of keeping the line moving to get patrons seated. Given the weird tasting juices and unremarkable food, it's an average breakfast option convenient to those at the hotel or nearby in the Suntec City area.","633":"The last buffet planned on my calendar before I head back to Atlanta. Why Oscar's? Tbh it was not my idea though a restaurant at Conrad should not disappoint me. After all, Conrad is usually my usual choice when it comes to hotel accommodation when I travel.One can make a dining reservation via phone or email. I did the latter and the confirmation email was very prompt. I like that. AMBIENCE 5\/5The dining area was huge and bright. The chairs were comfy. I like how the lunch buffet was spread \u00c2\u00a0out and the signboards on each section. It was very busy when we stepped in 5 minutes after 12.SERVICE 4\/5Staffs were very prompt in removing used plates. They were overall nice and friendly. However, our water was not refilled even once. I expected more from a hotel like Conrad. I have stayed and dined in many of their hotels, services were always 5\/5 so the service at Conrad Singapore really needs to improve on that. Now comes to food...FOOD 4\/5I have no problem in returning here for their buffet lunch. All the food we had tasted were great and fresh. The selection was extensive and of high quality. For $59+++ per person, it is a steal. However, there are a couple of things I noticed:1) some food items were kind of cold (referring to hot food items). They all should have warmers. 2) maybe it is due to space constraint, the laksa noodle station was located outside of the restaurant. I did not bother to go out and then have to push in the glass door to reenter. The restaurant should try to find a space for the laksa station inside. Besides, it was cruel to have the chef manning the station outside. It was so hot and humid :(Today's lunch was a far cry from the buffet lunch I had at Triple 3 @Mandarin Singapore weeks ago. After my lunch here at Oscar's @Conrad Singapore, the rating for Triple 3 is really just 1 star! (see my review at Triple Three).","634":"I came to Oscar's twice for the Conrad's breakfast buffet during my stay and it was superior compared to many hotels I've stayed at. The restaurant is past the concierge and there is both indoor and patio seating.The server asks if you would like orange juice once you are seated because they don't leave it out on the buffet line. There are so many options for drinks (regular milk, stawberry milk, pineapple juice, mango juice, apple juice, drinkable yogurt, water, coffee, and tea). The buffet area is separated into several sections and the items refill quickly. There is also a chef station to cook your eggs to order. This breakfast buffet offers so much variety (rice noodles, congee, oatmeal, egg rolls, pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, rice, steamed veggies, steamed buns, dim sum, smoked salmon, cheese, fruits, cakes, cookies, and ice cream). The ice cream bar is pretty sweet because they have unique flavors such as cendol and gulamelaka. Get there early (between 7am-9am if you want to beat the crowd or don't want to end up sitting outside). Service is great (they always come and check on you and remove your plates accordingly). Honestly, this was totally worth the cost and saves time if you're in a rush (can serve as brunch).","635":"Had a great breakfast at this wonderful place, almost every daily for a day shy of three weeks. Food is exquisite and one is spoilt for choice! The chefs are artists, each cuisine tastes authentic. The menu is thoughtfully planned. I can never eat all that I want to, even if I'm just tasting all the things I do eat! Everything is so fresh and freshly prepared. Eggs to order is just scratching the surface. Fresh juice included. Fruits, nuts, cereals breads, rices, noodles, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Malay, European...Congee, Chyavanmushi, etc. etc..come for breakfast, leave having eaten brunch. No bloating, no fullness, just a blissed out tummy, reveling in food heaven!! Intuitive and attentive personalized attention to detail, they greet you by name. It takes a special team to make every guest feel valued.

Staff are wonderfully hospitable and courteous!","638":"Small dining room and comparatively small buffet, \u00c2\u00a0but with good quality food items and friendly service. \u00c2\u00a0There tends to be a line for breakfast between 730am to 900am, but it moves quickly. \u00c2\u00a0A bigger dining room would help. \u00c2\u00a0There exists a smaller buffet on the 4th floor where the hostess may try to divert you during peak time.","639":"Decor: South Beach meets Beverly Hills. It's definitely a Hilton property. Great spread but layout not as spread out. This buffet was lacking any malay or Indonesian options which was disappointing. The Japanese corner was subpar.","640":"Been coming here for years and it has remained consistent. The quality of food is 4 stars, however the minute selection sets it back. Price point does not measure up to the variety at The Line, Carousel etc. but Oscar's is a lot less chaotic.","641":"I feel that Oscar's is the kind of place that doesn't really feel like \"just 3 stars\", yet is it on the same level of any other restaurant\/eatery I've rated 4 stars? No, not really.So take this rating with a pinch of salt then. Oscar's is slightly above average as hotel buffets go.I entered Oscar's with pretty low expectations. Recent buffets fresh in my mind include Carousel, The Buffet at M Hotel, and one other one that was so mediocre I don't even remember where it was.First thing you notice as you walk around the buffet. Oscar's has oysters, and there're 3-4 types. They're also all shucked to order. There's sashimi, and those are all cut to order to. The night I went, there was Swordfish toro sashimi, and it was spectacular. The fatty, buttery goodness of the swordfish was very memorable, and I'm dying to find out if it's a regular feature on the buffet line (apparently the buffet last night was the \"earth hour buffet\").Hot stations featured a salmon in puff pastry (gave that a miss) and a very delicately cooked, perfectly medium rare Beef Wellington. The beef was moist, tender, and pink, and the mushroom gravy was very flavourful (though a bit too rich). There was a seafood pesto linguine that was surprisingly good, and very fragrant... and the juice offering of pineapple, lychee, and mint (called the earth trio, so I suspect that was a special feature) was absolutely scrumptious. Though maybe a bit less pineapple would have made the flavours more balanced.The waffles made to order were crisp, just a little bit salty so that they made a perfect accompaniment to all that ice cream, and it pretty good ice cream too. Maple walnut is always a winner.It of course, wasn't all perfect. The other desserts were fairly mediocre, the pear and ginger crumble tart was all crumble and no pear, a lot of the other cooked dishes were only fairly mediocre. The chicken in garlic crust? Horrible. Veal in mushroom sauce? Okay, but the sauce was again, a trifle too rich. Oh. The roasted baby potatoes were delicious, and the Polenta cakes well executed. So it wasn't all bad.Another thing I liked was coffee and tea being included in the buffet. Specifically, Ronnefeldt tea. It's a brand that Raffles Hotel used to use, and I genuinely like the teas they have on offer. Peppermint and Earl Grey are both excellent, and their Chamomile is also very fragrant (comes served with a pot of honey too).So, mediocre dishes aside, Oscar's definitely impressed. Service was attentive, food was definitely of a good level. This might just be my new \"go-to\" hotel buffet. Of course, it helps that I can book it via Chope (which I did for this visit actually!).","642":"Serving up one of the best international buffets around and conveniently located in the heart of Singapore, Oscar's caf\u00c3\u00a9 and terrace is the perfect place to host large groups of friends for gatherings. With a sampling of pretty much every cuisine you can imagine found here and the quality of the food being quite consistent, you definitely get your money's worth dining here. The service is also friendly and professional without being too overbearing. A good time to visit would be during birthdays as they serve a complimentary cake so this might be something of interest to take note of.","643":"As a hotel guest we have three options for breakfast but Oscars has the biggest variety. I miss my local food so I skip the toast and muffins and head straight for whatever local selections they have for the day. I'm normally not impressed when hotels try to offer local fare but I have to say their local food is pretty good. The service here is very prompt, possibly one of the best when it comes to buffet places.","644":"Really had a great experience at Meta and the restaurant really deserves the accolades it has received. I'm a huge fan of Korean food and they take it to a next level hear with the modern interpretation and use of carefully sourced ingredients. They have both lunch and dinner where the menu is a set menu. The dinner set comes as either a five course or seven course menu which includes a number of snacks to start the meal. Food: 4.5 starsService\/environment: 4.75 starsOverall: 4.5 starsI went with the five course dinner set which also included 4 snacks with the meal. Everything was really delicious. \u00c2\u00a01) Sago cracker was topped with fish roe and small bits of octopus. The first snack and nice opener to the meal.2) Mushroom tart was really interesting. The tart had thinly sliced mushroom with coffee powder over a mushroom pur\u00c3\u00a9e. Really tasty and something I never really had before.3) The beef tartare is a modern take on a classic Korean dish. \u00c2\u00a0The tartare is mixed with a raw egg yolk, bulgogi marinade and brunoise of pear. \u00c2\u00a0The tartare is topped with some sunflower seeds for some added crunch. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not the biggest fan of tartare but really enjoyed this dish. 4) Chawanmushi is topped with sea urchin and had hints of black truffle mixed in. The texture is a less firm than your typical Japanese custard. This was really delicious and decadent. One of the dishes I will remember from my meal here.5) the first main was aged hamchi crudo. The fish is topped with sea grapes, daikon and served over a sake sauce and dashi jelly. Fish had a nice texture and I enjoyed the mixture of flavors.6) The grilled abalone dish is a modern interpretation of a abalone congee dish commonly served in Jeju island. The abalone is first slow cooked for four hours before being finished on the grill. The abalone had a real nice texture and a slight Smokey flavor. The abalone sits on top a bed of barley and garlic shoots. \u00c2\u00a0I love garlic shoots and wish it was used more in cooking. 7) The quail dish is a bbq quail whose skin is stuffed with a quail sausage. I often find quail to be a bit gamey but that was not the case here. The chef's French technique is highlighted here in this take on a classic French dish. The sauce work again is spot on and the burdock jus is really luscious. 8) The Wagyu short rib is the main star of the evening and looking at the marbling of the beef I can see why. The short rib is cooked for 40 hours before being finished off on the grill. This meat is ridiculously tender and super delicious. The meat is topped off with a bone marrow jus and paired with a Korean style potato ragout. Really delicious!9) Last dish was the dessert which was really quite interesting. The dish consisted of cocoa nibs cooked with liquid nitrogen over a crumbled chocolate cake pieces and finely diced pear. The dessert is topped with candied shiitake mushrooms. Sounds odd but works and the shiitake really is from and center. Something I will really remember.","645":"Came here for my birthday dinner. First of service is excellent, one of the best if not best in the country! The food is Korean French fusion which actually elevates some of the blandness of French cuisine to really tasty levels. Had the seven course tasting menu along with a couple of French reds. Standouts for me were the oyster duck the Japanese abalone and the three amuse bouches. Highly recommended!","646":"I wanted to love Meta. Set in a charming venue, we took the 7 course menu. Some of the courses were incredible - the Pigeon, Wagyu, Beetroot Desert and Gochujang Choco stood out. The Grilled Squid was nothing special, and the Petit Fours were a little hit and miss. Based on the food alone, Meta would score a comfortable four stars. It was more imaginative than a lot of tasting menus. The service, however, wasn't incredible. We felt slightly rushed, like they were keen to churn tables. At this price point, you expect a charming Somm to pitch you wine pairings - not here. I'm glad we came, but not desperate to return - especially at $250+ SGD (incl 2x wine glasses, plus service) pp.","647":"Upon searching for Michelin starred restaurants in Singapore to grab lunch at (always a good option if cost is a deterrent because the lunch menu is often a subset of the dinner menu, but the price is much more budget friendly), Meta popped up. Chef Sun's newly minted restaurant on the edge of China Town received its first star this year, so we figured it would be easier to grab a lunch time reservation on such short notice. We lucked out. The food was stellar, the service attentive, and the vibe very hip. We were presented with three flavor-packed, immaculately executed amuse bouche. I don't even know what all the ingredients were in each bite because they were complexly constructed to amount to perfectly balanced bites in texture and flavor. \u00c2\u00a0For my three courses I ordered the prawn salad, wagyu beef and the tropical dessert. I also ordered the oyster as a supplement. The prawns were perfectly cooked. The beef was rare and cooked evenly throughout, probably via sous vide. It had mushrooms and grilled asparagus. My husband who hates those vegetables liked them, so you know it must have been done well. The dessert was mango sorbet completely submerged in a mountain of coconut whipped cream and passion fruit sauce, with a bit of coconut crumble. The oyster was topped with lemon, ginger and gochujang and was surprisingly not spicy and in fact both savory and sweet. If you're looking for a classy, delicious, truly Michelin experience, look no further. Meta is it. At only $52 SGD pp, it is practically free in Michelin dollars.","648":"Nice new addition to the Keong Saik Road scene! \u00c2\u00a0Good service. The duck two ways was amazing. The short rib too... and the wine pair (though a bit overpriced for what it was) was well balanced. Will be back!","649":"1 of the best value for money 1 michelin starred restaurants in singapore. Have been dining here since it opened. Their menu is seasonal; spring summer autumn & winter so there is always something fresh & new from chef sun & team every quarter. The food is korean fusion done well, east meets west, the amuse bouche has always given a nice surprise. They used to have an excellent uni bimbimbap & korean seafood pancake when they first opened and i wish they would bring them back. The irish oyster with chojang (korean spicy vinegar) has been around since day 1 and is not to be missed. Lunch is always good value but try to get both courses of desserts & sample their petit fours. The seven course dinner menu will certainly make sure you are full at the end of the meal if you are very hungry.","650":"I was introduced to Meta when we were there on a special occasion. Located in the colonial style shop house along Keong Saik Road where you will find bustling with people in the night, Meta is a chic restaurant that offers contemporary Asian Cuisine in a Seasonal yet inventive way.Ambiance in Meta is relatively good, no doubt that the restaurant is long and narrow, taking about 30 seats only, either at the bar counter with high stools or the usual tables. Colors used in the restaurant were simple yet soothing under the spotlights, allowing a classy feeling while dining. We had chosen over the bar counters over the seats at the side so that we can enjoy watching the chef preparing the food and enjoying our food served at the dark granite bar counter.With such a relaxing environment, it will be a waste without a sweet class of imported Raspberry beer like this.Raspberry Beer - $12Before we even start our 5 course meal, we were given snack like this, elegantly served on a black tile. \u00c2\u00a0Small Octopus (Tako) Cubes \u00c2\u00a0was cradled by the crisply and bubbly squid ink cracker with a dab of cream cheese and few reddish orange caviar. Presentation was exquisite and this snack did really paint a good start for the upcoming dishes with its different kind of texture, crispy, soft and rubbery.Another surprise to me is this, the bite size Kaya toast with truffle butter topped with Parmesan cheese. The toast was such crispy that I had mistaken it for Macarons. Pairing it along with Beef tatare and raddish. Awesome!Fall Menu5 Course Menu ($98) Nothing was more happier to have tasted those soft and thin slices of Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi. They were placed on pickled green apple and mix with yuzu vinegar and basil oil, topping up with Tosaka Nori.Sashimi of Hokkaido ScallopThe driven Chef Sun Kim had turn the sticks of Capellini into its Al Dente Texture in no time. Sitting over the counter was real interesting as I manage to see him using the bigger pasta fork, coiling the pasta up in a tower form. Spanner Crab, as well as some korean seaweed had topped the pasta. Overall, this dish was flavourable in its tasty stock!GuksuFor the additional, Since Chef Sun Kim was from Korea, we thought of ordering his national dish and had a try out. Pancake was tasty and not a bit being starchy. It was filled with calms. Pickled raddish was also provided. It is best recommended to enjoy the Korea Delicacy by dipping onto the special sauce or pouring it over.Seafood Korean Pancake - $25While most of us will expect the pancake to be oily, the Chef had actually taken additional steps reduce the greasiness.Well flavoured and lightly sweetened in its sauce, the Smoked Quail was served in its tenderness. I wasn't expecting that it was such an easy bite on a Quail than on a chicken. Together with the big piece of Portobello Mushroom, leek and raddish, it made a perfect combination.Jasmine Smoked Quail The slow cooked beef cheeks was served with potato gratin. \u00c2\u00a0The sauce and ingredients used did marry well. Beef Cheek was topped with egg plant, celeriac and watercress.Slow Cooked Beef CheekBeef CheeksGiven the choice between Beef Cheeks or the Lamb, I would prefer the latter. It complemented with the Doenjang (Bean Paste), Carrot and Parsnio.Rack of LambAnother View for Rack of LambThe last item on the menu and its really hard to bid farewell here. Pear was coated in silver with White Chocolate ice cream as pairing. What is unusual here is that you are able to taste some peppery taste in from the ice cream.Dessert - Silver PearlWhite Chocolate Ice Cream with PepperWe called for the bill after the last dish on the menu and was told that was not the end yet. What could it be we thought. It was a nitrogen surprised that came serving in a jar with pebbles. We were told to place the leaf side of the Rock on our tongue to get the full experience. The nitrogen steams then comes up of our mouth while we chew and talked. Wow!The RockI simply love the way how service were rendered throughout my dining even at the counter bar. Emptied plates were consistently cleared with friendly services even from the chef. I recommend this place for those who want to experience a different dining or on a special date. Since its menu is seasonal and definitely I will be very interested to check out its next menu and surprises.","651":"Incredible refined taste, love the fusion style fish with tasty soupy sauce having a Japanese twist. Oysters are a must have, fresh in flavourful dip. Several small appetisers came along on top of the course of menu, which was a pleasant surprise. Very good value lunch set for Michelin star standards at $50+.","652":"I literally gasped in horror soon after I was seated at the counter and witnessed the chef use the same spoon to taste what he was preparing as he did to mix food he was preparing for a customer. I was in such shock that I sat there for a while to be certain of what I saw. There was a metal canister on the counter in which the chef had a few utensils he was using to prepare and plate food. He grabbed a spoon to mix a sauce and then used the same spoon to taste it, and put the spoon back into the same container. A few minutes later, he grabbed the spoon and did the same.I explained to the waiter what I saw. He said the container was filled with water as if that made it ok. The waiter then said it was very acceptable for a chef to taste food while preparing it, which I completely agreed with, but only if done with a clean spoon each time. I'm sure there are worse practices in restaurants that I have not witnessed as they are behind the scenes. But I would expect much better from a Michelin starred restaurant at this price point. This was simply unacceptable and unsanitary.","653":"I had a hard time trying getting my head around the Contemporary Asian label on Meta, a new stylish restaurant that has opened along the vibrant Keong Saik Road. The background of Chef Sun Kim gave an inkling to the cuisine direction- this good looker hails from a family of South Korean restaurateurs and is also the alumnus of Tetsuya Sydney and Waku Ghin Singapore. I reckoned it would be Asian inspired dishes and flavors with modern techniques and presentation but all that mattered when we embarked on the dinner was 'what's next'. At present, the restaurant offers a choice of three set dinner menus, namely five ($88) and eight-course ($128) Tasting Menus and a five-course Vegetarian Menu ($80). Here we have the eight-course Winter menu.The current appetizer is the Oyster with Pomelo, a plump Irish oyster seasoned with tangy lemon and ginger dressing, and finished with a sprinkle of pomelo flesh for bursts of sweetness. The Amaebi (Japanese sweet shrimp) dish was served with a dashi jelly, trout roe, slivers of pickled beetroot stems and carrot, as well as a smokey charred prawn head. The prawn head was the highlight of the dish though and everything else was what you'd expect of a sashimi dish. As much as the prawn head is super umami, i really do not recommend swallowing the whole thing unless you're ok with shards. Another highlight was the Wagyu Tartare with Egg Jelly and Korean Pear Kimchi. One bite and you know you're having an elegant deconstructed bulgogi bimbimbap with a more refreshing pear kimchi (Sun's homemade kimchi dressing) instead of the regular acidic and tart pickled vegetables. The egg jelly helped to gel the elements together and a topping of puffed rice added crunch to it. \u00c2\u00a0Scallops are undoubtedly one of my favorite shellfish and these plump Hokkaido ones were paired with a slightly sweeter Korean miso, squid ink cracker and topped with compressed and shaved bottarga for more flavors of the sea. Someone give me more of the cauliflower pur\u00c3\u00a9e please! Though the separate ingredients were executed well, I felt that on the whole they didn't really come together as a dish and thus it was forgettable. Our favorite dish was certainly the comforting John Dory\/Sea Bass with Clams, Fregola and Basil which sees the pan-fried fillet of white fish (that crunchy skin side) presented atop a trio of clams in a clear clam broth (gosh that sweet brine) and finished with drops of basil oil. Slow Cooked Tasmanian Grass-Fed Beef Short Rib with Parsnip was given the Asian touch with pickled oyster mushrooms, charred spring onions and parsnip puree. The beef is cooked sous vide for over 30 hours at 62\u00c2\u00b0C to break down the tendons and as such, it was kind of gelatinous. I prefer my meat with more grain actually and that is still possible with this technique. Flavor wise, it was on point. Vegetarians can look forward to Meta's dedicated vegetarian menu which features a take on the popular street snack, the Korean Pancake with Seasonal Vegetables, and (purple) Potato Gnocchi with Sweet Corn and Parsnip.For desserts, Pastry Chef Tammy Mah wowed us with her novel and innovative desserts. The classic cheese cake was given a twist with her Citrus Cheesecake with Blood Orange Bon Bon. A golden citrus gel encases the citrus cheese mousse and 2 dark chocolate hemisphere that held a blood orange liquid center. The creaminess melted away to reveal the light bitter crunch, which cracked to contrast the intense and fragrant blood orange jam. The White Chocolate Wasabi Cream with Sesame Sponge and Yoghurt sounded scarier than it tasted. You would hardly notice the wasabi if you didn't know it beforehand. It provided some \u00c2\u00a0tingliness after each mouth, which was enhanced by the crackly pops. A fun 'petit four' was The Rock, a smoking espresso meringue made on the spot using nitrogen. Smokin hot.A list of cocktail concoctions are available at Meta but I wouldn't say it's their strong suit (that or I really dislike overly sweet drinks).","654":"Can't believe I waited so long to try this but I'm glad I did. One of the best restaurant I've tried for the past few months. Went there for lunch and were impressed with their food. Had a four-course summer lunch menu - beetroot salad, seabass, smoked quail and summer berries. Quail was better than the seabass, I think. We spent an average $70\/pax but worth it. Would I return? Yes.","655":"Enjoyed my le petite chef session yesterday.. the service is awesome and the host was exceptional..Once a lifetime experience .. worth every cent","656":"So glad we ventured into the Hyatt to try Mezza9 for dinner. Despite spotty service the food was fantastic. The ambiance is very chill and perfect for an intimate date night. Reservations are recommended, but they were able to seat us promptly without. Great menu consisting of a variety of dishes from sustainable seafood, steaks, salads, soups, slow food simmered and roasted, as well as thai specialties including noodles and fried rice. There's something for everyone here. The wok fried lobster with crispy noodles, mushroom, spring onions, ginger, and egg gravy was absolutely sultry and divine. One of the best things we ate in Sing. My Aussie angus filet was perfect. Tender and dry aged 28 days served medium rare. Steaks are al la carte, so get a side with it. Apps were also amazing. Wild mushroom and kale soup was outstanding. The caesar salad was equally satisfying. After dinner, meander to the back of the restaurant to the martini bar for an after dinner drink to round out your dining experience.","657":"The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Grand Hyatt hotel. We had a group business dinner in the wine room, which is an experience in itself. You are sitting next to all of the first growth Bordeaux (Margaux, Latour, Lafite, Mouton Rothschild), lots of second growth, also DRC, Gaja and more - truly creates a special mood for the wine lovers. We had dinner family style - excellent crab cakes, chicken wings, a couple of salads, followed by steak, pan-fried chicken and salmon with French fries, Brussels sprouts and a few other side dishes. Dessert included a number of different sorbet, ice creams and more.Excellent service, both dinner, and wine.I definitely recommend the restaurant, but probably having an expense account would be a significant plus.","658":"Review for soft launch of Beyond Burger:Day 1:How was the plant based Beyond burger? Yes, it was good for the novelty. I love food trucks and love the vibe here, but for $10, seems like they only cooked the patty and bun.... As a meat lover, this was overall ok. I was very surprised by how half the burger felt warm and the other cold. The patty, when eaten alone, didn't have much taste. The sauce, however, went well with the patty. Texture and color was also not close enough to beef. It had ok chewiness but not what I wanted in a beef patty, not dense enough? Color was very very red as well. Also, the veggies were not cooked so the onions were too raw for me. the veggies made the patty cold too quickly. And the cheese was mild in flavor and kept breaking into small pieces. Melted cheese in a burger please!!!! Day 2:Get the classic! The Asian don't need to bother. The sauce was a dry paste so it didn't really cover the patty. Didn't taste wasabi or siracha mayo. The patty still has a funky aftertaste, definitely did not fool me to think it was meat. The slaw had not much taste, should be pickled for more flavor. The burger was much smaller than the classic. Sorry my dear friends who I've misled to try the Asian. For those who try tomorrow, go for the classic! At least the cold veggies problem is solved. Overall the beyond burger patty had good chewiness but was very dry. You need a good vehicle of melted cheese and lots of flavorful sauce to enhance the experience. Personally, it doesn't satisfy my meat craving, nor was it better than veggie patties I get from Trader Joe's or the classic Indonesian seitan. P.S. the burger shrank from day 1. I can eat 1.5 of them or even 2. Went with my friends for dinner round 2 cos it was just not satisfying. And everyone was so desperate for a drink, why? There's not supposed to be any MSG in the patty!!! \u00c2\u00a0Food truck ends 8pm on 18 Aug. beyond burgers will be going for $25 from Monday at the Mezza9. #futureofprotein #futureoffood #grandhyattsg #mezza9 #plantbasedburger #alternativeprotein #drklingeats #istillprefermeat #mockmeat2.0 #wheredoesyourfoodcomefrom #grandhyattsg #mezza9sg","659":"The main advantage of this place, which has a vibrant atmosphere, is if people in your party have different culinary preferences, they would probably find what they want here. Otherwise, the food is not as good as what you would find at the equivalent specialist restaurant - whether it is grill, sushi, Thai, Chinese, etc. Service keeps deteriorating; at our last visit, it was downright horrific: One waiter spilled hot water and did not clean the table until requested to do so; another waiter dropped a whole bowl of boiling soup and only provided ice cubes for our guest to cool herself when asked; drinks (iced tea, Diet Coke) came after 20 minutes, a glass of wine never came (in spite of a volunteered promise that it would be free)!! The table was left uncleaned for a long time. At the premium price charged, customers deserve better.","660":"The main advantage of this place, which has a vibrant atmosphere, is if people in your party have different culinary preferences, they would probably find what they want here.

(It's specific to the card type I think, you should check before heading there.) For a fairly reasonable price, you can indulge in a 3 course meal at lunch with coffee\/tea thrown in at the end!The bread they served was pretty good - possibly a ciabatta, with a roasted capsicum\/pepper dip. I had the sashimi salad, market roasted fish, and tart of the day. The sashimi salad was alright - it was a little too salty from the amount of soy sauce they dumped on it but was otherwise very generous with the raw fish. The market roasted fish was beautifully cooked but was extremely tiny! Just one slice of fish (I had snapper when I was there) with a couple of vegetables. I originally intended to just have 2 courses but it was so small, I was forced to order dessert. The day I was at Mezza9, their tart of the day was pear. While the ice cream served with it was dismal (strange vanilla flavor, creamy but eh), the tart was actually pretty good. The pastry was nice and crumbly, and it wasn't too sweet overall.I'd go back for their 1 for 1 deal, but otherwise don't really see the point of spending all that money here.","662":"Strawberry cheesecake ($58\/kg) - 5 starsThis is my perfect cheesecake. Not too creamy, it has a bite to it that has the perfect amount of firmness. It's also not so rich that you feel sick eating it, but solid enough that I wouldn't have more than a slice.Blackforest cake ($58\/kg) - 5 starsAnother perennial favourite in my family. I've been recommended places like Stuttgart Blackforest Boutique S-Caf\u00c3\u00a9 but have found most blackforest cakes filled with way too much whipped cream (worse still when it's cheap greasy whipped cream). This one is just divine.","663":"The champagne brunch on Sundays is fabulous! Definitely book in advance - every table was full. It was $125\/person with tax & service charge, which sounds crazy but it is worth every penny. This includes unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne, which they top up every time you take a couple sips. You could also have bloody marys, mojitos, red or white wine. I'm usually not a fan of buffets as the food doesn't tend to be the best quality, but this one is different - top-notch food that was constantly refreshed. While vegetarians will have less selection than meat eaters, there is definitely more than ample food for everyone's tastes. The buffets included a raw bar of crab claws, oysters, even caviar. The cheese table was exceptional - high quality cheese with accompaniments like quince or honey fresh from the honeycomb. There was a Japanese section with many types of sushi & sashimi (including vegetarian). There was a Chinese\/Malay section with dim sum buns, meat on a stick, and many different seafood stir frys. The roast section had many options including wagyu beef sliders. The roasted vegetable sides were also plentiful. You could have eggs made to order. Plus there was a salad bar. And the dessert table went on for days!We sat for 3 hours enjoying countless glasses of champagne and leisurely working our way through all the stations. It was definitely a treat! (And you wont need to eat for the rest of the day)","664":"I took the long hike to meet friends here having started off at the Martini Bar for happy hour drinks first. The food was delicious and much needed to soak up the preceding wine and cocktails. I was surprised at how expensive the oysters were, but this is Singapore after all. Food was faultless and on cue. The salmon and greens were cooked to perfection. I loved the open-planned kitchen and of course, the Penfolds wine display! I think I tried some wine too, though this was nudging me closer to my threshold for the night. Dessert was gorgeous and I left well and truly filled and sated.","665":"The Mezza9 restaurant is a top choice in Singapore. It's not a buffet m restaurant, but they still deliver variety like no other restaurant I know. I love the fact that you have Thai, Chinese, Japanese, grill, seafood++ all at the same restaurant!I believe they have 6 or 7 kitchens. Food recommendations:-lobster bisque -pork skewers-crab cake++","666":"It's three stars for the food which ranged from stale table bread to fantastic lamb chop. \u00c2\u00a0Presentation was excellent but the flavor hits and misses make it a bit of lottery dining here, depending on what you order. Service was a lot like the food. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately our table was served by a generally absent waiter who saw it fit to educate us on the different types of coffee (eg what is a latte!) we can add to our dinner, which the other server had wrongly told us was included in our dinner set. \u00c2\u00a0All in, \u00c2\u00a0I was reminded why this is not a go to place for me.","667":"I went here for a Sunday brunch and it was quite crowded, many foreigners and many large groups. This is a great place for many types of diners and the restaurant is so large you can easily enjoy a quiet intimate corner for two, a private dining room for a large family, a big round table for a couple of families or any other type of diner.A real drawback, and perhaps it was just for this brunch, but they seem to have squeezed tables into every possible space and even places they shouldn't have, so you were often having to wait to walk through narrow walkways or trying not to bump seated guests while getting around someone getting food. I even saw a table setup at the hostess stand in the front.A big selling point for us was their family friendly atmosphere and they did not disappoint in this area. They have taken one of the above mentioned private dining rooms and turned it into a kids \"camp\" staffed with at least three \"Counselors\" who do a great job interacting with toddlers to teens. This is a free service that allows the adults to relax, talk, enjoy their meals and try many of the different selections. And there are many different types of food to choose from, I've been told that the 9 in their name refers to the nine different kitchens. There is Sushi, Yakitori, general asian, western, seafood, dessert and others I probably missed. Because of their show kitchen concept this isn't a buffet where the food questionably comes out in chafing dishes prepared in the back; this is food being prepared right in front of you and then often being refreshed into the serving dishes as you are taking. The food preparation doesn't get much fresher, especially for a buffet.I think almost everyone should be able to find something to eat, although I didn't see an Indian section or dedicated vegetarian food; and there wasn't a traditional western breakfast items at this brunch, egg station etc...None of us took part in the champagne part of the brunch, but there were bottles popping everywhere and I saw many other drinks, wine, beer and cocktails going by; and they gave us free flow of coffee and soft drinks as well. Often you ask at a buffet for a beer or a soda and you're told it isn't included, it looks like they will serve you any drink you ask for, and your bill will only reflect alcohol or not.Speaking of the bill it is very expensive to dine here, over $135 without alcohol. This wouldn't be a regular weekend activity but for a group with kids this is a great place to get together for a special occasion.","668":"Service was slow.Staff inattentive.Flavor nonexistent.Mains underwhelming.Visited Mezza9 for a weekend brunch recently. Came in with a big appetite ready to eat, left the restaurant bloated and discontent. What they lack in flavor they try to make up for in quantity. Staff seemed as deaf as posts unless they were talking amongst themselves. Took them 10 minutes just to give us the bill. Needless to say, we can just do away with prisons because eating here would be punishment enough, no matter how heinous the crime.In summary, a truly dismal dining experience that I 10\/10 would NOT recommend.But hey, at least there were no cockroaches.","669":"The only addition I would make to my previous review is to add that the service here from every member of staff is simply wonderful. It is arguably the best service in Singapore.","670":"Have been lucky enough to have dinner here on a few occasions although in all cases it has been related to work. As mentioned in previous reviews, many kinds of food are cooked almost Hawker style, well very upmarket Hawker maybe. We usually take a separate room at the back where the wine is stored. Some of the more expensive varieties are eye wateringly expensive. Anyway, on to the food. Here the story is all good, great selection from around the world. The sushi is particularly good. \u00c2\u00a0Yakatori, garlic bread, soft shell crab all met with a thumbs up. On the main courses, most pick the steaks although seafood is also popular. Again almost without exception it's great, the only black mark being the last time I was there. A colleague and I split a Wagyu ribeye between. For me it was ridiculously thin, maybe 13mm thick. I expect my ribeye's to be much thicker. The flavor was OK but definitely not worth the price. Service is usually superb and the most recent visit was no exception. Order anything except the Wagyu ribeye.","671":"You can be certain that the team at Mezza9 takes their desserts seriously when you discover an exquisite menu devoted wholeheartedly to desserts. Since September last year, this menu featuring five desserts and a cheese platter, has been introduced and adds on to the existing cakes\/pastries at the Mezza9 shop. What's better way to indulge in their DESSERT PLATTER ($32++) that offers a taste of everything after a satisfying Italian dinner at Pete's Place! Does this look like a hot piping Souffle? In fact, this is a frozen Grand Marnier Souffle \u00c2\u00a0that is no less potent than the bottle of liquor itself. Every spoonful oozed plenty of boozy goodness that I constantly reminded myself to handle this with extra care to minimize spillage. Much has been raved about the astoundingly creamy home-made ice cream and this mixed pool is no exception. The smooth, rich Papua New Guinea vanilla bean and Manjaro chocolate ice cream sat in contrast with the eye-poppingly tart Passionfruit sherbet and zesty raspberry sherbet, creating quite an exciting taste experience that would appease gelato and sherbet fans at the same time. There is a bonus that is not as showy as the curvy nut tuile perched at the top--bitter cacao nibs inside the intense chocolate gelato. Mezza 9 Deconstructed Pavlova ($16++ for ala carte) The cloud-like crispy baked meringues were taken down a notch on sweetness with the sourish kick from the sherbet and berries. Dessert flower pots are no longer any novelty but the Flower Pot ($16++ for ala carte) here is probably one of the better ones in town. It is not spammed with mousse or any cheese cake but a superbly executed caramel sea salt ice cream that enrobed the palates with toasty notes of burnt sugar. To be more precise, the caramel flavour was perfect, something that very few can mastered well (most are either overdone or underdone). Besides the flower pot, the Grand Cru Chocolate Mousse ($16++ ala carte) is my another favourite in this platter. After all the bright flavours, this chocolate jar proved to be a pleasantly bitter sanctuary that soothes the taste buds. I emptied the entire shooter of dark chocolate sauce and sank myself in the blissful chocolate bed.  A divine finish for the divine desserts","672":"Limited-time promotion menu always sound like an attractive deal and this month's specials features unique Thai Street Food prepared by resident Thai Chef Sittichok Panchum. \u00c2\u00a0The best way to try everything is of course, to go for the Tasting Platter ($45). Nonetheless, each component is available at ala carte and suitable for those who do not take certain kind of meat\/seafood.The meal began with a complimentary bread with the perfect S-shape curve. \u00c2\u00a0Served with a tomato relish instead of butter, it has such a fluffy interior that one can take an afternoon nap on it. These dishes certainly looked like what you remembered of Thai cuisine, but with a whimsical twist. An example would be the Moo Yang-a dish of char grilled pork belly served on satay sticks on a bed of slightly undercooked Thai jasmine rice. While the pork juices and the honey herb marinade drooled onto the grains and made the dish a little oily, I put our reservations aside and dig in deep. The dish was so flavourful that I would be happy with just a bowl of that same fragrant rice and pork belly.But there are other interesting offerings such as Sei Kua, an indigenous fusion of Thai curries and western sausages. Instead of meat, glutinous rice takes the driver's seat in the sausage casing. It is drenched with a dry thick red curry with pork that was competently sweet. \u00c2\u00a0The Baby Octopus was slightly chewy and rubbery, but its chilli sauces are unapologetically strong. The tongue starts burning from the chilli padi the more I chew into it but luckily, there were some cabbage slices to provide temporary heat relief. \u00c2\u00a0Meanwhile, there is also familiar classics like the traditional crispy thai fishcake. This is safe for those who are not adapted to chilli, as it has been masked by a transparent sweet thai dressing with sprinkles of peanuts. But nothing could beat the large and succulent spencer gulf prawns that have been lightly breaded and deep fried. The coconut could not be detected but it was so fresh that we had no problems demolishing them.Don't forget to spoon the speckles of garlic, green and red chilli padi on the prawn before putting everything into the mouth. These potent spices warm the belly in seconds. Just like the prawns which were Sustainable Seafood Movement, the Fish of the Day (price subjected to vary) features any fish that are caught on that day. We had the Drum fish, which has a moist and not-too-flaky texture. Dusted with black specks of olives and tomatoes, the al-dente penne pasta are a comfortable match to the fish. By then, we were pretty stuffed but marched off bravely to conquer the dessert platter. We were usually loyal fans of milky chocolate ice cream rather than sour apricot or raspberry sherbet. But it is the red and yellow granite balls that added sparkle to the rich caramel molten chocolate cake. The icy sensation melts into tart juices that brings everything alive, including the banana crepe with that is super crispy but rather hollow on the inside. \u00c2\u00a0Meanwhile, though the sourishness of the baked figs on puff pastry made one's face pucker unknowingly, it was nice balance to the sweet vanilla Creme custard sauce. \u00c2\u00a0Whether it's main courses or desserts, Mezze9 delivers. And even though it is a 5-star restaurant, its set lunches are reasonably priced at $29 for 2 course and $39 for 3 course from Monday-Saturday. What's even more attractive for me is the flexibility to choose starter-main\/main-dessert.  With that in mind, I have plenty of solid good reasons to come back again.","673":"So I made a new friend on Korean Air flight to Singapore.Apparently he was loaded, owning three factories around the world and wanted to treat me and my boyfriend for something special and invited us to this restaurant as he was staying at the hotel.I don't even remember the names of all the food we had but they were nothing like I had eaten before. Soooooo goooood! Foods from every corner of the world, it felt like. The presentation and also the taste. Singaporeans are quite good at making the food looking good. The place was looking fabulous and classy.I tried my first durian here.","674":"one of my favorite restaurants around. impeccable service along with great food.i love how consistent they are with e service. been here many times and without fail, im always greeted with a smile when i walk in. e attentiveness throughout e whole meal with e wait staff or manager coming around asking how's e food, makes you feel you matter.1. complimentary bread + diplove how e bread is served warm and homemade dip is yummy and makes you wanting for more.2. yu sheng (during festive \"lunar new year\" only)one of e nicer yu sheng i had so far. its served with salmon and kingfisher fish. you can opt for more condiments with extra cost. having e wait staff saying e good wishes for e yusheng in english seems kind of odd but have to give it to them for effort.3. boston lobster eefuu noodle \/ crispy noodlemy fav dish when im here but seems to be better last time. e one i had that day was kinda bland. this is good for 2-3 to share4. soon hock crispy fishso good you can eat it on its own. fried to perfection. wish i had this at home so i can chew up e whole plate together with e bones. omnomnom factor 10\/105. fried nian gao with coconut sherbetthey have this every year during lunar new year! this time i feel it was fried with too much egg but still good nonetheless. \u00c2\u00a0e nian gao and coconut sherbet goes v well together.easter egg for y'all who is reading this review. e deli have e best double chocolate chip cookie i ever had. thumbs up.","675":"Very consistent bar, food, desserts. Basically that sums it up.I've been visiting Mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt for a few years already but just recently I though again what good concept they have and how a good kitchen and quality management can make all the difference.Service is usually pretty good as well and I never had an issue getting a table here.What I like in particular is that you can order all different varieties of food and not just one particular cuisine. Sometimes you just want to mix and mingle your dinner options...Good spot!","676":"Been here on two occasions - but let's start with the food. Normally, the gauge of a good restaurant is how dedicated they are to the number of items on their menu - the fewer, the more concentrated their efforts are to perfecting them - but prepare to spend a good 10 minutes deciding on what you want - they cover all the meats - steak, whole chickens, all kinds of fish, pork, seafood, on the grill, raw, stewed, steamed, fried, blanched, in all forms, shapes, sizes, Asian, Western, or an amalgamation of all the above! Went for the Irish Organic Salmon, fennel, lemon confit 200g ($38) with a side of saut\u00c3\u00a9ed spinach with garlic (+$9), and MAN did it pack a punch! The salmon was cooked perfectly to my liking - just slightly orange on the outside and rare and succelent on the inside, so it wouldn't flake to the touch of a fork, and the spinach was gut-wrenchingly beautifully done - so tasty, that a gourmet Popeye would have his eyes popping out just at the smell of it.The selection of wines were also very seductive - from all regions, the obscure ones, the famous ones, the celebrity ones (that can go above $500 a bottle!), Argentinian, Chilean, imported from Bordeau... if you're looking to please someone who's extremely fickle at menus (and you're not sure if a certain place will be the right fit), Mezza9 has all the right things (giving you all the right reasons!) to come here. Did I mention that the restaurant is humungous and the furniture and furnishings, perfect? This is too much for me. Too perfect. :-)","677":"I completely do not get the previous reviews of this restaurant. Conveniently located in the Hyatt hotel, this restaurant, while elegant in decor, does nothing much to dissuade me from my prejudice against hotel restaurants. I sat at the chef's bar, which certainly has its own unique level of ambiance. However, the service was very inattentive, nothing close to the reception one should receive when paying these kinds of prices for food in Singapore. I'm fully willing to concede that this lack of service was primarily due to me sitting at the chef's bar and being by myself, but that doesn't entice me to ever return. In terms of the food, I had the grilled fish market selection of the day, which was a tuna steak. Nothing to write home about - not bad, but not anywhere close to the best I've had. This is served a la carte style, so I also ordered the Chinese broccoli to accompany. Again, decent but not great. The best part of the meal was the glass of Pinot. Excellent choice there.","678":"Absolutely the best place to go for Martini in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0They have a huge range of martini on their menu and other drinks too. Their Happy Hours is from 6-9pm, Mondays to Saturdays. \u00c2\u00a0It's always packed so you'll have to go early to get a seat. \u00c2\u00a0Otherwise you'll have to stand around. \u00c2\u00a0Very busy service staff and very friendly and helpful. \u00c2\u00a0I've tried their classic, chocolate and lychee martini. \u00c2\u00a0All great!","679":"I don't usually eat at hotel restaurants while on vacation however Mezza9 became my go-to spot. \u00c2\u00a0The service is punctual and there were a ton of staff. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately there was a bit of a language barrier at times. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant encompasses a huge open space with open kitchens which creates an interesting energetic atmosphere.The menu is mostly a selection of Chinese, Japanese and Thai favorites with a smattering of western items. \u00c2\u00a0I gravitated toward the Thai menu after hearing one of the chefs is Thai and had probably one of the best beef salads and tom yam kungs I have had anywhere. \u00c2\u00a0Amazingly fresh and flavorful with unmistakeably high quality ingredients.The only downside to Mezza9 is I left Singapore broke.A safe choice if you are in the mood for spending a relaxing night at the hotel, but obviously not the most exciting restaurant in a great city known for an amazing food scene.","680":"Mezza 9 is the restaurant in the mezzanine of the Hyatt Hotel. It's a beautiful open kitchen concept with chefs cooking right in front of you. There is Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine, served mostly family style. The service here is very good and the food is great as well. My favorite thing here though, would have to be their dessert. Try the dessert sampler for two (which is really more like for 4?) which is a platter of about six different types of desserts. Make sure to leave room for this! The restaurant also has a small shop that sells truffles, some pastries and cakes and kitchen and home wear. Check out the attached Martini Bar which serves some of the best martinis in Singapore.","681":"Sunday brunch at $138 per person, if you elect not to consume unlimited alcohol, or $168 if you do, provided a fabulous spread, but it's not worth the price. The decor is older, the atmosphere is hotel restaurant and the tables are so close together you find yourself tripping over people both seated and dishing at the serving stations. The food is fresh and cooked pretty much before your very eyes, the various open kitchens provide you with a show of sorts and the children's area is staffed and perfect in allowing parents the ability to enjoy their meal. I started with the raw bar and ate my way through oysters on the half shell and steamed shrimp. I did need a small bath after shelling the shrimp. Sushi was next and, while it was good, it wasn't particularly fresh or imaginative. The \"Western\" beef was rare and delicious while the lamb was cold and filled with fat. The mashed potatoes were excellent along with the green beans. No carrot cake (my absolute favorite) and the pecan tart was okay, but nothing more. I also enjoyed some delicious cheeses. It was a nice experience, but not one I'd sign up for very often. With four more of these \"hotel Sunday brunch\" places in Singapore, I'll need to shop around for a better experience.","682":"I won't repeat what others have said about the unique nature of this place. If you have not been here before, you should!Dinner prices can however be a bit steep. Lunch sets are however pretty good value, so I'll be back more often for that!As for the food, the pics speak for themselves!","683":"Had dinner here last night. We liked the atmosphere. They have (at least in the wkd) 2 seatings. One at 6pm to 8:30pm and one starting 8:30pm. We had a la carte yakitori, Who actually don't come on a stick, not sure why but they where all good. Overall the quality of the food was good. We thought it was quite expensive. Still 4stara we had a great evening","684":"Review of the new outlet at Dempsey. Hard to find, as it is tucked behind the Min Jian @ Dempsey restaurant, but by no means is Binsho a bin for the food show at Min Jiang! Compared to the original at Tiong Bahru, this branch has more cooked dishes. We had the uni shabu shabu - extremely yummy! The yakitori dishes are delish, more 'refined' than at other superior yakitori places. Great choices of Japanese whiskey and sake. Cocktails are also unusual, although the soursop margarita is a bit too sweet. Attentive, personal service. The downsides? It is pricey - unless you stick to the lunch sets, you would end up paying $130 a head. day we visited, the aircon was not working well so it was kind of uncomfortable!","685":"Review of the new outlet at Dempsey.

The menus are hung on the wall in the form of chalkboards. Besides the a-la carte items, there are 3 options for yakitori sets, all priced between $60-$120. Some of the pieces of the tori zukushi set were delicious - the assorted appetizer, chicken liver, tsukune with egg yolk, and soft bone karaage stands out. However the rest of the food in the set were bland and underwhelming. But to me personally the star of the night was the garlic pork (a-la carte). The meat was well seasoned, crispy on the outside and the garlic complimented the pork really well. We also ordered grilled squid from the a-la carte menu, but it was very chewy. While I think my meal at Bincho was overall satisfying, I found the price to be too steep for the amount and quality of food we were getting. It was more like a been-there-done-that experience, and I don't think I'll be coming back for their food. However they do have a pretty impressive list of Japanese sake and I'll probably return for that. 3.5 stars.","687":"This is among the easiest reviews I've had to give 5 stars to. Bincho is an incredible find and excellent experience from the moment you find the place to walk in its back door all the way until signing the check and heading out. The food and cocktails both are extremely great.My girlfriend and I made a Chope reservation to check this place out on a weekday night. We heard about Bincho through the shoutout from Singapore Airlines in their in flight magazine for SG50 and knew we needed to check out this hidden yakitori spot. You find a very nondescript corner of a building with a sign that says to go in through the back of the building where you walk in to what looks like a small tunnel. Since we were having dinner, we walked past the lounge\/bar area and sat at the counter, bracing ourselves for some solid yakitori.We went ahead with the Bincho yakitori tasting menu which included:1) An appetizer platter (chicken liver pate with baguette, octopus tentacle with some veggies, and some prawn dish), 2) Assorted Sashimi (salmon, tuna and snapper)3) Soup that you drink then eat its ingredients from the pot (included some fish, a prawn and chicken), 4) Chicken yakitori platter (neck, wing, breast and thigh), 5) Choice of lamb, fish or waygu beef skewered, 6) Japanese tomato 7) Tsukune Don - Chicken patty with rice and egg 8) Seasonal fruits which is japanese peach and grape. We shared one of those tastings then ordered 3 items off their a la carte - kinki fish, veggie platter and these yams convered with pork (looks like mini hot dogs) called Red Monnyaku Kurrabuta Roll. THIS KURRABUTA ROLL WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST DISHES I'VE TASTED HERE IN SINGAPORE. Insanely good, we devoured these in record time. Highly recommend you order that one and the veggies too. Kinki fish was great although it has many bones to pick through.Only thing I wish for is that they use the yakitori sticks for all of the meats they serve. That's usually my favorite thing about any yakitori place, even the Michelin starred ones around the world. For the cocktails, we ordered the Yuzu, Sake, Gin one which was light, refreshing and really nice. The one that really hits the spot is their Mangosteen Cinnamon cocktail which also has vodka. It tastes like a spiked apple cider drink, extremely easy to drink.Service is impeccable, ambiance is very New York\/underground Tokyo feel and the food is excellent. I would highly recommend coming here on a date or to impress someone. I for sure will be coming back again and and again.","688":"I cannot praise this place high enough, deciding to walk and take the back streets too our destination I had started to loose faith we were heading anywhere, and when we followed the small sign out the back down an alley I was dubious...Thankfully you open the door on the coolest sake bar in town and are able to grab a drink of one if their more unique cocktails or select from the bar menu.Choosing to be seated at the counter we were able to watch chef carefully and lovingly plate each dish Nd he was equally interested in our reactions to his delicious dishes.Our waitress was knowledgeable and together we agreed in a compromise of a share omake and a few special dishes from the regular menu which ended up being a little too much food but never got to the point if welling pained.Our drinks were constantly topped up and the staff matched sake perfectly to our meals, perhaps too much so since I did slightly over indulge.While prices were consistent or cheaper than Australia I imagine this could be somewhat more expensive then people realise though on my opinion it represents true value offering such care from the staff and craftsmanship from the chef.","689":"Food here is pretty tasty. It is at par with izakaya food in Japan--however, price wise, it's whack. $18 for one tsukune is ludicrous. I just don't get it. I've patronized this place twice, but doubt I will be back again.","690":"Having lived in Tokyo for several years and eaten all kinds of delicious Japanese cuisine, I am always skeptical of trying it abroad but, Bincho did not disappoint. Their Tsukune and Yakitori is delicious, the ambiance is cool and the presentation is unique. The bar is also diverse with many Japanese microbrews, sake and even an all-you-can-drink beer deal on Sundays. I guess the one difference between Tokyo and Bincho is the price. Be prepared to pay $50-100 dollars to get full, but this is expected as a good Yakitori restaurant is rather rare in Singapore and this place rocks!","691":"Wow this place is so cool! I felt like a spy coming here!Imagine walking through a plain coffee shop, past uncles having their kopi-o and smoking cigarettes at the entrance, and reaching confidently for the hidden door at the back before entering a secret lair full of cool people having Japanese food...Except that we weren't sufficiently IN THE KNOW, so we walked past this place maybe 3 times while looking puzzedly at our phones (\"Google Maps says we're HERE but WHERE IS IT?!?!\") to the amusement of said uncles, and peered into the coffeeshop to see a very normal-looking place, and finally walked to the back alley to open a nondescript metal door which led us to a dark lair of high tables and chairs and a bar filled with alcohol bottles with kanji on them.Clue: Use Google Maps. Then enter the coffee shop with the green door. And push the green door INSIDE the coffee shopAnyway. We were here for the lunch set which was a really great deal. Sets start at $25 before tax and go up to $40+, but you get a drink, a starter (of 2 chicken drumsticks), another starter (of chicken skin salad which was oh-so-yummy), your main and then dessert (mochi or ice cream).They recommended the chicken dishes (it's a yakitori restaurant afterall) but because we were greedy, we had the ikura negitoro (salmon roll, chopped tuna belly with chives) and yakitori sets to share. Portions were reasonable (actually I was already filling up quite a bit before the main came but there's always more room for good food...) and the service was really attentive.Ikura negitoro - ingredients were fresh and good, though it could be a bit underwhelming if just for one. Afterall, there's not much texture in a negitoro don (besides soft and mushy) I'm so glad we decided to share this instead of me having it all to myself.Yakitori - the slices of chicken were moist and tender, I loved the grilled skin as well. And it looks damn good on photos in case you want to make your friends jelly. (HI IM IN THIS COOL PLACE WITH AWESOME FOOD AND YOU'RE NOT, is what I sent to my boyfriend in Brunei)The restaurant is divided into 2 areas, 1 dark and claustrophobic (and you're all sitting at 1 side of the table, facing the bar, but not AT the bar, because there's an alley between you and the bar counter) and 1 bright and airy with a nice view of the chefs grilling the yakitori. You know which one to choose.(Btw I now know where the cool entrance is and I will be using it for my next visit)","692":"Exciting and surprising Japanese yakitori. This is not an everyday dining experience but for a special occasion. We went on New Year's Day and had the 10 course tasting menu. A brilliant sequence of grilled meat especially chicken plus wonderfully fresh sashimi, wagyu, soup and dessert. We sat at the counter which enabled us to watch the chefs at work. Truly memorable.","693":"I went for Sunday lunch and got here 30 minutes before they opened the waiter let me hangout at a table using their wifi until they were ready to serve. The food was great! I got the ramen which came as a multi-course meal. Excellent service and great food.","694":"Back in singapore. So I've tried Bincho again.Once again, the food was delicious and interesting. \u00c2\u00a0I tried pufferfish skin as well as tuna eye. Things I never get to try.The sashimi was delicious and the yakatori flavoursome.Each to e I come to singapore, this is where I will come.","695":"Great, fantastic, flavoursome, delicious, awesome - YUMMY!Feeling like some Japanese, I took to the internet to find somewhere.I wanted something different. From where I was staying, this was a twenty minute walk, so i called to book.Walking to where it was, I saw a sign, Bincho entrance around back. \u00c2\u00a0So off I went. Hubby wasn't too sure. There was a metal door with Bincho written on it. We had found it. Ultimately you can enter through the front, but the back entrance is cool.We were seated at the bench overlooking the kitchen\/ preparation area. The menu is made up of 3 omakasie(bad spelling) menus or an a la carte option. They allowed us to share and omakasie and top up from the menu. I still over ordered, but it all sounded so nice.The sashimi was fresh. The pork (tontoro aburi) was delicious. I've never had grill live clam and it wasn't as chewy as I thought it would be. Pleasantly surprised! Grill beef tongue with garlic butter is a must. The chicken 4 ways was delicious particularly with an array of salt, mustard and wasabi paired with it. We ate a lot more than this (far too much) but it was all so nice. The chef was delightful and wanted to know our thoughts on the meal. Whenever I think of singapore, this meal is what comes to mind.","696":"Wow never have I disagreed with Yelp more than on this one. Bincho looks wonderful. It's set up in an old Tiong Bahru coffee shop, has been retrofitted with many bells & whistles and yet manages to keep the romantic old school vibe while still providing a comfortable modern dining experience. That is a big achievement. Unfortunately that is where the achievements end.My dining partner and I went for their two omakase-style sets (Bincho & Fuji) that were semi-delineated on their chalkboard menu while leaving some room for the chef to make decisions. We were really quite disappointed with both the quality of the food and the quality of the service.Firstly, on the food. I get that Japanese food is supposed to be simple. But that doesn't mean it's supposed to be average. The beauty of being a master Japanese chef is that you can use the natural flavours of your ingredients in a simple execution to deliver deliciousness. This did not happen here. There were too many courses for me to call out individually but the food was uninspired, often bland and not even remotely appearing like value for money.Those two sets and a beer with the ++ we are accustomed to ended up at $250+ for two. Not the most expensive meal in Singapore but certainly not the cheapest. But where is the value? We received several (I mean like 4) sets of yakitori pieces that I have seen better executed for much less money at Ippudo Tao. Dessert consisted of a single strawberry and a slice of rockmelon. The chawanmushi was plain egg with a single scrap of meat. I could go on.This was capped off by service that lacked any kind of finesse. Staff were obviously inexperienced at service for this price point. English language was poor, explanations on dishes were unavailable and etiquette was lacking (case-in-point, if you're a waitress, don't stand around in the dining room on your phone looking bored).The donburi course was presented as consisting of \"chicken thigh\". Upon closer inspection, there was clearly no chicken. When I highlighted this to my server, he first suggested I was wrong. When I challenged him to show me the chicken and pointed out that I could see fish cake, mushroom and egg, the response was \"of course it's a mix lahhh\". I politely suggested he should check with his chef. Upon returning he informed me that it was a completely different dish to what he introduced when he served it. With no chicken and no apology. In a related aside, where is the finesse in a rice bowl with supermarket fish-cake, egg and basic enoki mushrooms?Not good enough Bincho. Why should I spend $250 at your restaurant for bad food and bad service when I can go to Ikyu around the corner and have an infinitely superior meal? Answer - I won't again.","697":"This review is for the bar only as I haven't eaten there yet. \u00c2\u00a0Since I moved into the area last year I have heard so much about the place (I have even visited Hua Bee (the old noodle store front) in the day and used Bincho's bathrooms). but never actually visited until last saturday when we were looking for a place for post dinner drinks, Bincho comes to mind. \u00c2\u00a0I have to say it's a pretty cool experience. \u00c2\u00a0So my 3 stars is only coz my experience there is so limited - definitely need to return and try out its other offerings. \u00c2\u00a0First, you need to walk in through the inconspicuous backdoor facing the carpark (not the usual store front side). \u00c2\u00a0The door looks like the usual restaurant backdoor. \u00c2\u00a0Think you can only get in through the front but I think getting in through the back is more fun. \u00c2\u00a0Then once you step in, the space reminds me of one of those WWII bunkers in Berlin or we could have been in a space ship. \u00c2\u00a0The vibe is intimate and lounge-y, good selection of drinks and cocktail. \u00c2\u00a0I tried the Bincho Banks which is a whisky based cocktail, a bit on the sweet side for my liking. \u00c2\u00a0Seem to have a good selection of japanese desserts as well but didn't get to try this time. \u00c2\u00a0The only pity is that it closes at 12 mid night and last order is 11:30 pm on a saturday, but i get it, this is a residential neighborhood but if they open later I can definitely see myself just hanging out there some more. \u00c2\u00a0And yes, I would also recommend trying Hua Bee in the day, it's an institution. \u00c2\u00a0Bincho sadly is part of the gentrification of tiong bahru, even though I find it pretty cool, and you can see from its clientele every group i saw walking out of the dining area has at least one expat. And in case you are wondering about the mee pok man poster in the bar area, it was filmed in Hua Bee and is Eric Khoo's debut feature, so one more reason to visit.","698":"I had their beef tongue don. \u00c2\u00a0The tongue came in thick slices instead of the typical thin cut you get at yakitori places. Being a lot thicker, they should really really season it more. \u00c2\u00a0It was cooked well. \u00c2\u00a0A little on the chewy side but still pretty good because tongues aren't easy to grill. I love the side dishes. \u00c2\u00a0They were pretty and tasty! The chicken wings were amazing! Overall a pleasant experience. Yes I would go back! Took away a star because it was too expensive for the portion.","699":"My friend and I happened to be staying across the street from this hawker stall, and a quick search showed me what great reviews this place had!We got the meal for 2, which was a very reasonably priced 21.90 SGD.Lucky for me, my friend wasn't really hungry, because it was sooooooo good that I ate way more than my share. It came with a shrimp appetizer, basil pork, and your choice of Tom yum soup or green curry. Warning: it was very spicy!","700":"A hidden Thai cuisine stall inside one of the many coffee shops along Balestier. Blinking neon lights on the signboard. But the large menu of photos looked promising so we ordered ourselves a pad thai, a minced pork omelette (okay, nothing to fault) and a coconut milk chicken (non-spicy and has a tang to it, but too little chicken and mushrooms). Please allow me to rave about the pad thai. Having tried pad thai on my numerous trips to Bangkok for leisure, I've tried my fair share of the stir fried rice noodle dish. The version here has fried egg, a generous serving of bean sprouts, crushed peanuts on the side, and is super delicious when a lime is squeezed over it. The taste was spot on.I wasn't hungry at all when we ordered it, but I devoured every bit of the wonderful pad thai. Please try it. I hope to be back again.","701":"I was stumbling around looking for a food center near my hotel and all I could see where expensive touristy restaurants with American or overpriced Singaporean food. I stop for awhile to watch the fountain and asked a security guard where I might find a food court. He pointed down... I was standing in top of it! I discovered some amazing paper dosa masala amongst other things. Wow that thing was huge and totally inexpensive. If you are staying in the Pan Pacific this food court is in perfect proximity.","702":"I wish we had food courts like this in the States, but unfortunately all our food courts contain crappy American chains and very basic lunch food. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not sure what to compare the prices to since another reviewer commented on the expensiveness of Food Republic, but I found it to be very reasonable and quite cheap. \u00c2\u00a0The tables are also clean and the decor is modern and new-looking.I tried a couple stalls while I worked at Millenia Tower this week -1. Thunder Tea Rice - it was good, but not amazing. \u00c2\u00a0I wouldn't voluntarily choose to have this as lunch, I don't think, but it's worth at least one try. \u00c2\u00a0Definitely something I haven't had before and the \"tea\" is.... interesting. \u00c2\u00a0Make sure you get all the toppings and go for brown rice!2. Fish ball noodle soup at Gu Zao Mian - YUM. \u00c2\u00a0Exactly what I wanted \u00c2\u00a0They have 5 or so noodle types for you to choose from and you can't really go wrong with any of them. \u00c2\u00a0The fish cake and fish balls were flavorful and went well with the soy sauce\/chili (not sure of official name). \u00c2\u00a0I'd totally eat this all the time if I worked here.Nice clean area with plenty of choices for food.","703":"2.5 stars.I came here for breakfast with my wife since we were in Suntec and few things were open yet. \u00c2\u00a0We had some noodles and duck rice. Pretty average, but a bit on the more expensive side for hawker food in Singapore, but passable. Won't be coming to Suntec for Food Repubic, but I might eat here if I'm here for some other reason.","704":"Of all the chain Hawkers\/food courts, Food Republic is my favorite. Although not my favorite food republic (Ion Orchard location is my fav because of Indonesian BBQ hehe), this is place packs a punch as evidenced by the scores of people who choose this location as their go to lunch place during the work week. In my view, the Zhong Hua Curry Rice and Guan Chee HK Roasted Rice are the best. The curry chicken rice in particular has a lot of flavor and does not overpower you with the curry. Believe me I had enough curry I could handle after my trip to India and was hesitant to try the curry rice at first. However, after a detox session of two weeks, I gave the curry rice place a try and have not been disappointed. If you're Singaporean and choose your hawker stall based on the longest line, then the curry rice is your best bet.I'm not much for yong tau foo\/mini wok, but my Malaysian colleague who has a discerning taste says the ytf is pretty good. Overall, this is best food court available between marina square, Millenia walk and Suntec!","705":"Avearge quality food at very expensive price. \u00c2\u00a0Space is too small for a small group lunch.Most of customers are moving to the upstair kopitiam with better food and price options.","706":"I met my husband for lunch at Suntec as we had some business to attend to there in the afternoon. We walked around for a long time trying to figure out where to eat, eventually everything looks the same. I am still not adventurous enough to try things that I do not know what they are. I know, eventually I need to get out of my box! My husband and I ate at the Japanese food stall. I had chicken teriyaki for $5.80 SGD. That's a \u00c2\u00a0heck of a deal if you ask me! It had chicken, rice and miso soup. The chicken was part white meat (which I love) and part dark (I do not love that). It still had some skin on it which I had to remove, but once again, this is local fair, I am the one that needs to get used to it! After we ate our reasonably priced lunch, we stopped at a fresh juice stand. I had a \"purist\" which included carrot, green apple and ginger. It was $3 and wonderful! My husband had a mango juice which was rather bland. It was a reasonably priced lunch and a great Singapore experience.","707":"I found the dishes here pretty spicy! Had the chili and lime sea bass which the whole party enjoyed, just the right amount of zest and spice. Mango salad had crispy shrimp bits in there, yum! Otherwise, service was prompt, ambience was nice and enjoyable. Would recommend!","708":"Authentic Thai food set in a cool, comfortable surroundings. Like the Art Deco on the walls, lots of Thai influence. Dishes took a while to arrive, I guess it was peak dinner time. Nonetheless it appeared and we tucked in. Mmm... The flavors of Thailand can be tasted in the dishes. Some dishes were spicy. You can tell the waiter not to make it that spicy. But there's Thai deserts to cool you down too.Cost for 5 dishes is $120.00 without desert order. A bit pricy.","709":"Nice ambience, good food! They have a very wide selection in the menu and some unusual dishes as well. The heat factor was much lesser than most typical Thai restaurants, my wife didn't like that at all but my son enjoyed this place more than most of the other Thai places we go to.We had fish cakes, red curry, minced pork with basil leaves, grilled chicken with Pandan rice, iced lemongrass all of this was pretty good, some of the dishes were served with pickled vegetables which added a nice crunch! Service was pretty decent and the food came surprisingly quickly..","710":"I've been to Marutama Ramen in Vancouver, BC, and was VERY pleasantly surprised to find one here in Singapore!!! \u00c2\u00a0The ramen offered here is different than most other Japanese ramen spots - it's not salt, soyu, miso, or pork based broth. \u00c2\u00a0It's a chicken based broth, a cloudy chicken based broth. \u00c2\u00a0That alone might off-putting to some people, but they should really give it a try! \u00c2\u00a0We ordered the regular and spicy ramen. \u00c2\u00a0As I've done in Vancouver, I tasted the broth first, then added the table side accompaniments. \u00c2\u00a0Those garnishes include garlic chips, togarashi, and sesame seeds. \u00c2\u00a0The ramen is just as I remembered, glad to know Marutama Ramen is consistent across oceans. \u00c2\u00a0The noodles were cooked perfectly, the chicken broth had the right amount of salty flavor, the cha-shu pork also added more depth to the broth. \u00c2\u00a0We added an egg to our ramen order, it was a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, and once broken added more creaminess to the broth! \u00c2\u00a0Seriously, the perfect bowl on a rainy day in Singapore!!!","711":"Different from your typical ramen shop as they use chicken broth. Very generous with the noodles and ingredients, much more filling than other places. Seaweed used is also a little special (kinda kelpy). Overall, a nice light change from the usually overly salted ramen variations.","712":"Great ramen. Small space and expect a queue especially during lunch times. This restaurant has been here for years. Go for the Marutama Special, around $19 (before GST).","713":"Tried the Zenbu Ramen. Well balanced Ramen I would say. The amount of seaweed\/spring onions with semi fatty pork is perfect for one which craving for fatty meat but in the meanwhile got it covered with vege. Chicken broth is good. Recommend the spicy version for this ramen.","714":"I had dinner at Marutama tonight after several years. I ordered the regular ramen with pork. The noodles were soft, which was to my liking, but may be considered overdone for those who like theirs al dente. The broth was also a tad too salty for my liking, though I did finish most of it. There was a generous serving of spring onions, which I thought was disproportionate to the broth and noddles. Garlic, sesame and chilli powder were provided. \u00c2\u00a0This are 3-4 types of ramen available, with spicy or non-spicy chicken broth options. Aside from these, they also offer some gyozas and 1-2 rice options. There is a queue during peak hours.","715":"Located in town along the popular Killiney Road, you will find this Japanese ramen diner tucked in a corner.They serve quite a nice ramen with the right springiness accompanied by a hot soulful broth.We ordered a bowl each of:Karashi Ramen (spicy) $12Chicken soup based ramen was full flavored yet portioned just nice. This must be a popular order.Zenbu Ramen (all toppings) $18This was a Full Bowl of everything including a lot of ramen. If you are hungry, this boy is it.","716":"Had the special ramen with all toppings. Amazing pork that just melts in your mouth. Egg has a slight sour taste to it.. Wife refused to eat it though.. Good quality for the money. Recommended if you need a quick ramen fix","717":"Tried this today with a mild sore throat. The fact that they use chicken base soup helped soothe my throat. The pork dish that everyone said to try was very good. we also tried the guise and egg, both delicious. I would recommend if you're looking to try chicken based soup ramen. Yummy","718":"The queues at Marutama stretches excessively on certain nights and after my experience, I just can't figure out why.Admittedly, Marutama is immensely generous with the toppings on the Ramen provided for the Liang Court Food Trail with 3 slices of Char Siu, 2 pieces of Pork Belly Kakuni, a Tamago (Boiled Flavoured Egg) and plenty of Negi (Spring Onions) and Seaweed. However, the star of the night, the ramen noodles and soup itself, was a disappointment and having tried favourites like Santouka and Nantsuttei, I feel that Marutama is just not up to par. The soup, being chicken-based, lacks the thick flavourful consistency that pork-based soups provide and doesn't pack a punch. The noodles were stringy and felt sadly like the noodles I get from instant ramen that can be purchased at Medi-ya Supermarket.Still, one thing I did enjoy, immensely, was the boiled Tamago, which is the best I have had at a local ramen place. With solid egg whites browned from soaking overnight in flavoured vinegar and a molten yolk inside, Marutama definitely puts alot of effort into a dish many cannot master and this was the star of the evening. Other toppings like Char Siu and Negi were average while the Kakuni reminded me too much of Chinese braised pork belly.For the full review and more pictures, visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u00e2\u0080\u00a6","719":"Now you can find chicken rice balls in Singapore as well. I thought they only had that in Malacca...these chicken rice balls had to be rolled by hand when the rice is hot. The moulding of the rice balls changes the texture of the chicken rice, where it has a slight mashy texture.Another special feature of this chicken rice is that the chicken is drizzled with dark soy sauce instead of the usual light soy sauce gravy, and is accompanied with braised egg on the side","720":"Another place in Singapore to get a great Hainan rice that's tasty and fragrant. Well, this 1 is in the shape of balls like in Malacca. Accompanied by braised pork and\/or steamed chicken with tofu soy based soup on the side. Finding your way around can get a bit confusing with all the road constructions on the area and the scaffolding surrounding the shop itself.","721":"I like kway chap and there don't seem to be many of those around. This is a good one and the food is always fresh. There's often a queue. It seems to move ok. The usual suspects are all good here, intestines, the kway and soup, chilli and they also have quite nice duck. Pricing is ok especially if you don't order duck. I ordered a 2 person set and we had trouble finishing (but we also had prawn noodles on the side haha)","722":"Heading to Zion Riverside Food Centre, we decided to give the usual Char Kway Teow Stall a miss and go for something different. Reading the Signboard twice to confirm what I had misread during my first glimpse as I had associated the name with Boon Tiong Kee, the famous chicken rice restaurant. There is a few Kway Chap stall but being the typical Singaporean, we joined the stall with the queue as compare to the other which had none.A good wait for about 20 minutes in the queue before we got our set of Kway Chap for 2 pax at $10. Portion of the set looks appetizing with big bowls of Kway in brown soup and ingredients being stacked up nicely with 2 kinds of chilli provided. Portion was worth $10 indeed.Kway Chap Set for 2 - $10No pork belly and no skin in the platter and in fact the interesting find in the platter was pork trotter meat which was so tender and served in smashed form among the savoury sweet braised sauce. Braised eggs, tender duck meat, intestines and Tau Gua was provided. I would say that I'm rather impress by the stack of food which was neatly placed in a sequence besides having a well prepared portion of innards without leaving any trace of smell.I love the Kway for its soup has a slight taste of the herbs and not salty. Portion is definitely not for baby's stomach :).It will be good to drop by again and have a taste of its competing stall right on the left side.","723":"Pretty big menu. My recommendations : Xiao Long Bao. Comes in 5s or 8s. The skin is thin, with steaming broth inside. I would rate these pretty high against other XLB shops. Plus point: they have finely cut ginger shreds with a decent tasting vinegar. (Most hawker\/ eatery that sells XLB don't put in the effort in cutting the ginger into thin slices and vinegar tastes really sharp)Guo tie are good too. Served upside-down style with a crispy layer with all the pieces embedded in it. Guo tie are pork and shrimps, so it's sweeter tasting vs the XLBs. I've tried various la miens. Noodle texture is springy and freshly made.","724":"This chinese restaurant serves xiaolongbao (xlb), guo tie (pan fried dumpling) and handmade noodles amongst other chinese dishes. \u00c2\u00a0If you are interested in trying out their dishes other than their noodles, they also dish out some pretty delicious dishes too. I love their fish maw soup. Fortunately for me, this restaurant is located within stone throw from my office so whenever my colleagues and I are craving for xlb or zha jing mian, this is the place we go. The xlb is pretty good \u00c2\u00a0here. The skin is not too thick with a flavorful broth in each of the bun. Although my personal preference is their guo tie. I love how the panfried it with a thin cripsy surrounding the guo tie and each dumpling is generously filled with meat and chives. The zhajing noodle here is great too. The sauce is just right with the minced meat, handmade noodles and cucumber.The food here is good but don't expect exceptional service.","725":"Really enjoyed my dim sum brunch!I had high expectations based on the Michelin star and it more or less met expectations. \u00c2\u00a0Good execution, great flavors, good service.I got the BBQ pork buns, pork & shrimp siew mai, shrimp rice rolls, spicy pork dumplings.The BBQ pork buns were the best I've had. \u00c2\u00a0Really good bun and well marinated, high quality pork filling. \u00c2\u00a0Spicy pork dumplings were also well executed. \u00c2\u00a0Great sauce.","726":"What's good about this place is it's open until 3 o'clock in the morning, a good place to go to grab some dimsums if you're craving it during unconventional time. I have been to Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong (North Point branch) and their menu is more extensive than this branch in Singapore and I honestly believe their food is better compared to this place. Be sure to get their baked char siew pork buns though, they are to die for!","727":"Food was Delicious. Service was excellent. Extra bowls was delivered without as needing to ask for.The famous baked BBQ buns are a must there They were also voted best restaurant in Asia this year.","728":"finally, a tim ho wan that i'll write a review about ah!:)yes, yes, everyone knows they have a michelin star!yes, yes, everyone knows how cheap they are!yes, yes, i've been to their hong kong outlet in sham shui po and fought the horrendous hordes and emerged victorious ah!but this outlet is opened 24\/7!!!what?!yes, you can eat your favourite BBQ baked bun, no it is not a polo bun, here at any time, any day!your chances of scoring a seat, without a fight or a long ass queue, is that much higher here!and thus far, i did not have to queue at all lah.and this outlet serves a special breakfast and supper menu outside of their regular meal hours.granted during those ungodly hours, to some, there is no table service!no big deal, just order from their simplified set menus during those periods and collect your choice at the kitchen counter when your number is up lah.parking here is also easy at the new aperia mall.what?!yes, aperia mall, yet to be fully occupied and a work in progress.so once again, no crowd, best bah!isn't it amazing how there are now more tim ho wans in SG than in HK!?and soon, you can even enjoy their big 4 heavenly kings down under lah, wunderbar!","729":"After the Monday to Friday grind, there's nothing like a good food adventure to kick start the weekend right! \u00c2\u00a0El Queso Grande was interviewing a candidate for a job, so I had the morning free to run wild and so I ran all the way to Tim Ho Wan at Aperia Mall near Lavender MRT to check out the famed heavenly dim sum.There were a few larger groups waiting for tables, but as a solo diner, I scooted in right away with my little clipboard for ordering. \u00c2\u00a0The placements have pictures of all the items, which makes ordering super convenient. \u00c2\u00a0The one downside of dining solo is having to rein in the ordering...I settled on two of the four heavenly kings, the pork buns and the carrot cake and one wildcard: the spring rolls filled with egg whites. \u00c2\u00a0The buns were adorably round and with well balanced sweet and savory flavor. \u00c2\u00a0The carrot cake was good, sinfully gooey inside with crisp corners. \u00c2\u00a0I would have liked even more crispiness on the top and bottom, but I have no limit to the amount of crispiness I can handle. \u00c2\u00a0The spring rolls were delicious too with tiny baby shrimps stuffed inside with the egg whites.Service was snappy though you could tell the staff were bracing for the weekend rush when waits can top an hour (or so I hear).The space is airy and bright with street views and only a five minute walk from the MRT.PARTING THOUGHT: they should install a THW live line cam, so you can plan when to go!","730":"This HK Michellin star awardee is sprouting up all over the island. Personally, i find their food ok but not as fantastic as what many make it out to be. This outlet is good as the queues aren't that crazy. Food taste authentic and true to the taste of their HK flagship store which i tasted. I was really dissapointed at their congee, tasted really bland. I would say that the food in general is a good bang for the buck but the French should try a couple more Dim Sum joints and they will realuse that they will be dishing stars to many other Dim Sum places.","731":"Frankly speaking, I don't see what's all the hype about this place. The food is extremely normal, nothing that screams WOW!!!! As you can see, there's not much photo of food as THERE'S NOTHING NICE that deserve a space in my photo. I will say it's just an overpriced hype food that will be going out of fashion soon.I have given this place, different branches, a few chances. I will say, it's really nothing fantastic. Save the calories for other more deserving food.I will give this place zero star for the food. The saving grace is the service. The serving staff comes with additional bowls and soup without us asking for it. So this 1 star is for the excellent service staffs that they have.","732":"Overhyped. Overpriced. UnderwhelmedDISCLAIMER: we got there at 2am so the supper menu was available (which is not as extensive as their regular menu) but it made such an impact, this is the first and last time ill ever visit a tim ho wan.Also, they asked us for our last order at 230am, so not quite sure if they 24 hrs everyday. Pl call ahead to check. We had the fish porridge, beef brisket noodles, har gow, chicken feet, veggie of the day (poached lettuce) and shrimp\/pork wrapped in beancurd skinOf all the dishes, we liked the veggies the best!!!Har kow prawns were big\/fresh but skin was chewy.Beancurd skin was also chewy. The beef brisket was very tender but tasteless, as was its Soup. The porridge was average and the chicken feet is braised, so if youre expecting the usual chicken feet dim sum dish (which we were), youll be disappointedAll in all, it cost us close to $50.You are better off heading to swee choon for your late night dim sum fix. We only ended up at tim ho wan cause it was a tues and swee choon was closed","733":"Came for lunch on a Sunday and the restaurant was the only one doing brisk business in this place. No surprise as its mainly a office building so parking was a breeze. There was a queue at THW but moved rather quickly. We ordered a whole bunch of their dim sum including their promotion specials - fried dry Hor Fun with chicken and prawns. What we had and verdict - Glutinous rice in lotus leaf - very good Har gow - $6 for 4 is quite expensive and on par with Chinese restaurants in hotels. That said, it was competently done with thin skin and crunchy shrimp filling. Siew Mai - same feedback as the Har Gow. Malay cake - fluffy soft and not too sweet. Wu Kok with Chili crab filling - interesting. Not badSpinach and shrimp dumpling - loved this with its chewy transparent skinShrimp Cheong fun - decentCheong fun with sesame sauce - won't order this again as its quite boring and the sesame sauce was on the stingyHot tea is chargeable but refillable.","734":"In the mall right next to the office building, the dimsums were ok. We were hungry, so ate it all up but nothing spectacular for all the hype about it.The funny: The waitress was stern - we were joking that we better get our order right or else she was going to ask us to report to detention!","735":"If you're willing to wait 30 min or more for a brunch\/dim sum on Sunday and I recommend this place. \u00c2\u00a0Braised bun Bbq pork , chicken feet, are good, quite filling for Sunday morning. \u00c2\u00a0Not too pricey( $50 sing) for two with 7 different type of food. \u00c2\u00a0I forgot what I ate due to food coma...","736":"If this is HK fare then I think the Brits must have done the dimsum pre 1997.I have never tried this famous place in HK but I have given this place 2 or 3 chances to blow me away. Its a popular spot indeed with q's building up. This branch is 24H and seems to be filled most hours of the night. I tried it once at 9 pm and another time at 1 am. My experience was similar.Tasteless beef noodle ( where I had to pour my entire portion of sauce and chilli) to get a modicum of taste. \u00c2\u00a0Limp cheong fan. \u00c2\u00a0Hey giving up my ketofgenic diet for a limp cheong fan is a big deal to me. Soya sauce for the CCF was also rather thin.A very forgettable ordeal. Charsiu pau which was warm and toasty helped assuage a bit of the hunger.","737":"I thought the food was very average considering how much people talk about them. Service is, ehrm, Singaporean. \u00c2\u00a0Definitely not your culinary experience to talk about. Wouldn't recommend.","738":"Wait too long for quality of food.Michelin starred? are you kidding me?Not any better than other regular dimsum places.Feels more like cafeteria dimsum.just not up to par to justify all the hype....","739":"Char siew Char Siew. But not worth the queue. Service is prompt. Porridge is a tiny bowl. Just mostly the Char Siew. My Fav!","740":"This is a fast food dim sum place. I preferred a real Cha Lo. Limited dim sum selection. Nothing outstanding.","741":"For all the awards they received we had expected better and were disappointed. We had the porridge, chicken feet, chive dumping , shrimp roll, baked char siew pau, dessert -chrysanthemum jello . The items were either too sweet or too salty. Majority of the items were in the $6 per dish. Don't mind paying if food was good.","742":"Good Lebanese food, and we easily got vegetarian options and choices. There was a belly dance performance and the dancer catered to both the al fresco and indoor diners :) Ok service. Sitting outside got a little crowded though, but I suppose that's the case with any al fresco dining in these neighbourhoods!","743":"Came with some friends for the Singapore Hummus Festival. Nice ambience and the food was great. Tried the new flavours for the hummus dip and loved it. It has always been my go to place for some Middle Eastern food.","744":"Excellent food - hummus and falafel was fantastic. Great ambience too. Totally picked this at random, and loved it.","745":"Staff were alright but considering it was iftah that is understandable. While the mixed cold meze player was rather small, the items were very tasty. Also had the mixed grill and the moussaka (chicken) which was good. The amount of pill bread were small but fresh and well madeAlthough they didn't have Lebanese garlic foam, the food was good. Probably the best middle eastern I have had in singapore. Also the price point was good. I will definitely go back. Thank you to the staff and the chefsGreat job","746":"Yeah, so probably ranks as a really disappointing local food experience (first in Singapore) and what makes it worse was that this place was recommended by a part-time local (she lives 6 months here and 6 months in India). Maybe I should have protested more strongly, but I once took the recommendation of a local to try a Chinese in Cologne (my first thought for that had been, really? Noodles when I can have bratwurst?) but I ended up going there and it was hands down best Modern Chinese \u00c2\u00a0food that I had eaten in Europe. So it was with similar frame of mind that I approached here but this restaurant frankly failed in my mind to deliver for the most part. And it's not like I am basing this on just one dish. I was in a party of 6 diners and we ate home style so folks shared the food they ordered and we also ordered an entree, so my feeling of disappoint is based on 7 dishes, of which only 2.5 I thought were good, but not good enough for me to go back for a return experience. So my thoughts on the dishes:1) Mezze Platter: hummus needed a more robust taste, but good quality olive oil. Thought it was interesting that there were two kinds of baba ganoush - one with smoked eggplant and one with yogurt. I liked yogurt one more, but majority of folks preferred the smoked one. The cheese was too salty for me in the rolls, but I liked the crispness of the falafel.2) Mixed Grill - mixed experience!! Lamb Kebab sucked - super tough and lacked any spices. Chicken was decent. Lamb chop was burned (c'mon really? why would you even send this out to a diner?)3) Spicy Calamari - urgh! Horrid sticky after taste. The calamari also tasted super slimy - not sure how fresh they were.4) Chicken Shishtiush - liked this one, flavorful and juicy. If ever going back, would get this.5) Vegetarian Moussaka - liked this as well, actually maybe my favorite dish of the night, but that might be because it was drizziling in oil!!I am going to stop here.. just writing about how bad the food was is depressing me. My verdict - AVOID!","747":"Just a couple of appetizers, all good, indoor and outdoor dining. Not too expensive.","748":"I love shawarmas. \u00c2\u00a0But unfortunately, finding a decent version in Singapore has been very challenging. \u00c2\u00a0Beruit Grill comes very close though with a Chicken Shawarma roll plate that also includes fries and pickled veggies. \u00c2\u00a0I love the fact that they use tahini with the roll - none of the garlic crap or chili sauce that places like Shiraz would use. \u00c2\u00a0If anything, I found the tahini to be too watery and a bit underwhelming in flavor. \u00c2\u00a0But still this is a huge improvement. \u00c2\u00a0I am definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu, but for now, I am happy that I found a decent shawarma in Singapore!","749":"Found this restaurant walking through the neighborhood near the Sultan Mosque, and chose it because on a 95 degree day, there were a number of people sitting outside and even more indoors having lunch at 2pm. \u00c2\u00a0We were seated promptly, but afterwards received indifferent, inconsistent service. \u00c2\u00a0While they were quick to take our order, the beers took forever to arrive, and getting water was a struggle. \u00c2\u00a0They weren't particularly friendly at any point and received absolutely no gratitude for having patronized the establishment.From the food standpoint, we were pleased with our selections, which included a hummus with lamb, tabbouleh, and a mixed grill. \u00c2\u00a0Carlsberg draft beers accompanied the meal, and were very refreshing on such a hot day, once they arrived.I will agree with other reviewers that the prices are on the higher side, but overall it wasn't exorbitant. \u00c2\u00a0It's a place worth eating at if you're in the area, but not worth making a special trip by any stretch of the imagination.","750":"Was wondering if the last time was a fluke (and we only thought it was amazing because we were super hungry and thirsty), but nope! The food, drinks and service were amazing, again.We sat upstairs in the air conditioned bar, and had the Beirut mezze platter appetizer. \u00c2\u00a0The food tasted fresh and delicious, and all of the dips on the appetizer were so tasty!I had the moussaka chicken this time and it was perfect! \u00c2\u00a0This will be my go-to spot in Singapore for Lebanese food!","751":"Tucked on a street near Arab street, Beirut is a gem of a place. \u00c2\u00a0The food is excellent and so is the service! The quick version:Lemon mint fresh drink - super refreshing and delicious!Appetizer mezze platter - dips and pita were all so very good (even passing muster with the self-proclaimed hummus snobs in the group) (quick tip: if there are four of you sharing the platter, get extra pita bread because you'll need it! The server suggested it, thankfully, when he took our order.)Chicken shawarma - delicious! The sauce was unbelievably good and the wrap was well constructed. The ingredients tasted fresh (crisp veggies), and despite it being quite saucy, the wrap wasn't soggy or overdone. Perfect! Others in the group had eggplant dishes (moussaka) and lamb chops that they really enjoyed! Food, service, and ambiance were all perfect; will definitely be coming back to enjoy when I get a craving for Lebanese food!","752":"After a weekend trip our bus dropped us off near the Kampong Glam Neighborhood in Singapore and we headed to Beirut Grill for dinner. \u00c2\u00a0My friends and I started with the mezze platter which honestly could have been a meal in itself and it was soo good. \u00c2\u00a0I loved the falafel and all the dips were great, since there were 4 of us we got extra pita via the servers recommendation which was a good call. \u00c2\u00a0I got the eggplant moussaka, yum it was fabulous. \u00c2\u00a0Everyone I was with couldn't stop raving about how much they loved there dishes. \u00c2\u00a0The services was great and upstairs they have a bar which I know is hard to find in the section of town.","753":"One of the good middleastern \u00c2\u00a0restaurant in singapore the mezza plater and the lamb shop is must to try","754":"The sample platter was amazing. and the lamb chops were delicious too. We enjoyed everything from this place.","755":"In a small enclave labelled Arab Street, \u00c2\u00a0you'd be spoilt for choice if you are craving some Mediterranean \/ Middle Eastern fare, \u00c2\u00a0and if you chance upon this cosy entity called Beirut Grill, \u00c2\u00a0you will not go home disappointed. I am a regular here, \u00c2\u00a0for a good reason. \u00c2\u00a0Their staff is attentive, \u00c2\u00a0friendly amd tend to you the moment you arrive at their doorstep, \u00c2\u00a0which is a good sign in my books. \u00c2\u00a0Having been to Dubai twice, \u00c2\u00a0there were a few dishes for which the barometer had been set and Beirut Grill came quite close to meeting that level of authenticity. Their labneh (cream cheese yoghurt dip) is legitimately fantastic. Soft, \u00c2\u00a0creamy and flavourful, \u00c2\u00a0it comes quite close to what I was served in Dubai. Have it with pita bread or Mexican flat bread, \u00c2\u00a0it goes well with either. The hummus (chickpea) dip is equally good. Additionally for starters, \u00c2\u00a0their felafel is a must-try. Not too oily, \u00c2\u00a0crunchy on the outside and soft inside, \u00c2\u00a0I was left wanting more. \u00c2\u00a0Served with sesame paste dip it is a great way to start of any meal at Beirut Grill.Their halumi cheese on the other hand, \u00c2\u00a0was too salty and that overpowered any other flavour your taste buds would have picked up, \u00c2\u00a0and seems a tad bit too oily when compared to the other halumi dishes I've tried across Singapore. I am guilty of ordering repeat dishes because I love them so much, \u00c2\u00a0but do give their mixed grill platter a try. Served with 3 different types of grilled meat, \u00c2\u00a0the tenderness and flavour of the various entries will satisfy your palate for sure. The shish taouk ( skewered grilled chicken) \u00c2\u00a0served with lebanese rice is also a worthy option when choosing your mains. The good thing about the restaurant is that they have mastered the art of serving meat that is easy to cut, \u00c2\u00a0chew and swallow - \u00c2\u00a0tender and flavourful. They have a fantastic selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks as well. Go for the arabic teas in a variety of flavors. \u00c2\u00a0I am not a tea-drinker but friends tell me that it's pretty good here. Also who can forget - \u00c2\u00a0sheesha! It would almost be a crime for a place like this with ample outdoor seating to not serve sheesha. Go for their 'Paan' menthol flavoured sheesha, \u00c2\u00a0in this humid country its refreshing and cools you down instantly. All in all, \u00c2\u00a0a great place for dinner, \u00c2\u00a0lunch even, \u00c2\u00a0or simply for a hangout session with friends. :)","756":"Grilled meats and smooth creamy dips are made for each other.Here, you can start off with tangy, perfectly seasoned hummus and round it off with salty, flavorful lamb chops (delicious and I don't love lamb!) \u00c2\u00a0Along the way, you will be relishing the savory Lebanese spices generously heaped on each dish.The food:Get at least one dip here. \u00c2\u00a0We tried the hummus and it was wonderfully creamy and smooth. \u00c2\u00a0The special red pepper dip was great and packed quite a kick too. I don't usually eat eggplant, but was impressed by two different eggplant preparations in the sampler platter - one was a more fresh preparation and the other a standard baba ghanoush. \u00c2\u00a0The falafel has a great crunch though I wish it were a bit more moist inside.The grilled meats here are everything they should be - cooked perfectly and seasoned well. \u00c2\u00a0I loved the chicken shawarma, kofte kebab, lamb chops, and steak shish kebab. I've enjoyed every single piece of meat here.This is my go to restaurant around Arab Street and for good reason. \u00c2\u00a0It is easy to get a table here and service, while not warm, is efficient. I'll be back for more tasty Middle Eastern food!","757":"Nice decor, reasonable food, but just exorbitantly overpriced... $14 SGD for a small tabouleh - seriously... \u00c2\u00a0:-PWould have come back if the food was amazing, but for average to OK food, the prices were ridiculous...","758":"Fantastic food, outstanding service. We have been here a lot and every time it has been great. Price is \u00c2\u00a0dry good and the atmosphere is amazing. Live band nearby and dancers that show up. Highly recommend.","759":"Yay! Middle-Eastern food. Again, wanted some non-Singaporean food and my mom claimed she hadn't had hummus before (or if she did, she didn't know that it was called that). So I dragged my parents over to Bussorah Street and parked right outside Beirut Grill and ended up going in.Beirut mezze platter! ($22) Gd selection of hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal (I think? there were two eggplant dips, one had other veges mixed into it - so it sounds like that was the baba ghanoush and the other was the moutabal), cheese sticks (sambousek) and falafel (nice crisp! but odd in that there was some extra spice in it that I haven't tasted of before).Pita bread was awesome, warm and puffy. Only complaint is that 2 pcs wasn't enough for the entire platter, server offered us another basket, which we accepted (and paid $4 for another two more pieces, oh well....)Beirut Mixed Grill Platter ($29) - chicken was done very well! so were the lamb chops. beef tikka kebab was okay, a bit dry. and lamb kebab kofta was quite a lot gamier in taste than the lamb chops. I'm not a big fan of the gamey taste so that wasn't so good for me. And there was BBQ sauce on the platter, which struck me as somewhat American, I've certainly never seen it on any Middle Eastern place I've been to in the US but that may be just my experience. It added some flavour to the rice\/meat though, definitely! Oh, oriental Arabic rice was interesting - cardamom or some spice! Those two platters were pretty filling for my parents and I. Nice ambiance\/decor!","760":"popped in for a casual dinner and i was very pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was. service is sub par, but that doesn't surprise me given the area. hummus with lamb - rich and creamy! i loved the minced lamb. if you ask for hot sauce, they'll you a trio of sauces, one being a harissa chili oil. we added that in and felt the additional heat made it perfect. they only give you one piece of pita and will charge you when they ask if you want more - just an fyi. spicy sausage - great heat, the sausage reminded me a lot of chorizo. the sausages were sauteed with baby mushrooms and onion which added a nice richness to the dishlamb cooked in olive oil - i'm not sure what the name of our main was, but this was how it was described. the meat portion was a little whimpy, but the flavor of the meat and i enjoyed the slight crispiness of the rice it was served withoverall, a very satisfying dining experience!","761":"Had some drinks and finger food at Maison, and hopped on over here for some Middle-Eastern food. I loved the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of this place - very detailed and traditional with a modern twist. I loved their tables - as they had a really nice tablecloth under the glass - and it was really something else. The menu was detailed and done beautifully. The staff were pleasant and friendly. What I Loved: The food was yummmmmy! We ordered the Beirut Spring Chicken ($18) - which came with vegetables and salad. It was very fresh and the chicken was VERY tasty. The meat just fell off the bones and the marinade was just woah. Loved it. It was also enough to share for 2. My date ordered the a Lime Freeze Mock-tail drink - which was crushed with ice - it was very, very, very refreshing. I had a traditional Lebanese coffee - and that was amazing too. When I asked them what time they closed, they were like 1-2am, or even 4am on weekends. Wow! Prices weren't bad too - 1 main, plus 2 drinks, about $30-ish. Pretty okay - considering the ambiance and all.Pretty comprehensive menu. Explore!What I Didn't Love: Absolutely nothing!","762":"Delicious!Appetizers - 5 stars.Their beef tikka was amazing. Skip the lamb, too salty, had to send it back.Finished it off with baklava, not too sweet, rich flavour.Overall an amazing, flavourful experience. We will be back to Beirut, the Grill that is...","763":"I must confess I am not a fan of narrow restaurants with little natural light. We ate here for dinner on a friends recommendation. I was looking forward to some Lebanese appetisers, salads and grilled meats....after so much rice, noodles and stir fry the last few days. Maybe a bottle of red wine, nothing fancy, to complement it nicely. Upon entering and being seated....Observation #1: There were no middle eastern wait staff on duty.Observation #2: There were no chefs cooking in the brick oven kitchen who looked of Middle Eastern origin either.We ordered Tabouleh, hummus, Baba Ganoush, Kibbeh, a grilled chicken dish and Shish Kebab. With the exception of the chicken dish which had absolutely no hint of cumin, cinnamon, paprika,......nothing !....the other dishes were passable.The highlight was the continuos offer of some pita bread as extras. None were served with the dishes. I enquired how one is supposed to eat grilled meats or hummus without pita bread....'\"You want pita bread mister ?\". Mercy.Then of course there is the mystery red wine poured away from the table and brought to you to drink. Thankfully it was drinkable. I have no idea what I paid for.Don't eat here. It is not worth the time or money. Pick one of the other restaurants further up Bussorah street, towards the mosque, where many diners were seen that night sitting under the warm moonlight having a wonderful meal. Baskets of pita bread on tables in abundance !","764":"Slow service, mediocre food, tourist prices. Not sure why I would ever go back, if not for those yummy lime mint mocktails.","765":"We went for dinner with friends on a Tuesday night (July 21st 2015) and despite it being a weekday night when the restaurant was not busy at all the service to be quite lacking. A number of food items we ordered mezze platter and Foul were average, portion size of dishes small and meat kebab platter and Vegetarian Moussaka were quite poor.What is appalling is that we brought poor quality of Moussaka to the attention of our waitress and \u00c2\u00a0restaurant manager and asked it to be taken back. They gladly took it back with no apologies and didn't even remove the dish from our bill. We are never going back to this place - plenty other places in Arab Street to try.","766":"Beirut Grill was a date night choice over our usual favorite Alaturka, also off Arab St. We liked the ambience, decor, and friendly staff. We were a little disappointed in the food, specifically the temperature of both entrees, and the quality of the chicken shwarma. My lamb moussaka was delicious, but came out tepid, and the shwarma was also served a little cool, and the accompanying 6 French fries were a bit underwhelming. We greatly enjoyed a post dinner visit to the bar Magic Carpet upstairs, and the belly dancing was a fun touch during the meal. This place was not a must skip, just wasn't a must try.","767":"Still not as good as Urban Bites for Middle Eastern food but, by Singapore standards, it's really not bad. The hummus is decent, as is the baba ghanouj (which I have never seen in the Middle East itself, incidentally... I have no idea where this dish is actually from). I also recommend the shish taouk as a main. I've never tried the shisha and the service is typically foreign and understaffed but it's not a bad option if you're in the area.","768":"Timbre+ as a concept is pretty cool. \u00c2\u00a0An artful amalgamation of East and West. \u00c2\u00a0Take a bunch of western-style food trucks serving pizza, American, and French and park them in an airy hawkers center amidst more familiar offerings like a sarabat stall, fishball mee and an aunty hawking fresh fruit juice and cut fruit and you might just have a recipe for something pretty special.Timbre + has a lot going for it, and I do hope that the \"hawkers\" and the management team that had the cajones to put it all together live long and prosper! \u00c2\u00a0I really do! \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0I'm truly happy that someone has the steel tripe to gamble against conventional wisdom and plant a venture like Timbre+ in the middle of what used to be Ayer Rajah Industrial Park. \u00c2\u00a0The result is, of course, something quite different. \u00c2\u00a0The feel of the place is not quite urban hip because this isn't Orchard or even the river district, but take a closer look and you find an edgy cool and slightly grungy concept of a location. \u00c2\u00a0Sit down with a craft beer from the abundantly provisioned Bottle Shop and a consider your surroundings with a more studied eye and you begin to understand that the haphazardness is a facade. Timbre + is a considered, thoughtfully laid out, and well put together concept. \u00c2\u00a0Take for example the height of the ceiling and the prodigious number of Big Ass Fans that are lazily whirring overhead to keep the entire interior of this, essentially al fresco space airy, breezy and cool without being uninvitingly cave-like. To me, this demonstrates one very important thing. \u00c2\u00a0The powers that be of this place had the good sense to get the basics right without being totally overwhelmed by their enthusiasm for a fancy concept. \u00c2\u00a0 This happens all too often in Singapore where you have a totally awesome concept that falls flat on execution because nobody bothered to sit down and sweat the details, things like the ambient temperature, how tables are going to be bussed, and how a capacity crowd could be seated comfortably. \u00c2\u00a0Kudos, Timbre + bosses!!Put simply, I WANT Timbre + to succeed because success suggests the following:1. \u00c2\u00a0That more of Singapore will be explored for dining and entertainment. \u00c2\u00a0You don't have to be downtown to be a success.2. \u00c2\u00a0Singaporeans are a discerning enough crowd to know a good thing when they see it and are not deterred by unconventional locations.3. \u00c2\u00a0Unconventional locations = lower rents = more investment in quality. \u00c2\u00a0If we could only get enough Singaporeans behind this concept, we could all enjoy better quality, more consistency and fewer chain concepts.4. \u00c2\u00a0The Singapore palate would have the space and the opportunity to mature, become more sophisticated and more discerning. \u00c2\u00a0Ultimately, this is a good thing. \u00c2\u00a0More variety, fresher preparations, higher quality ingredients and less reliance on bulk and mass-production is a good and healthy thing.","769":"Good news\/bad news. The good news is, I had the most incredible wings from a booth called Two Wings. I mean fabulous. \u00c2\u00a0Perfectly cooked and seasoned. More good news. They had a beer place called the Bottle Shop with beers from all over the world. A bit pricey, but a great selection. The bad news is from a booth called Urban Smokehouse. Terrible. The ribs were cold and tasteless, the sausages were dry, and the pork belly was just meh. We were really disappointed. They had a local band playing tonight. Really good. Go for the music, wings, and beer, but stay away from Urban. Cheers all.","770":"I came here on a Friday night and as a result got to enjoy the live music with our dinner, which was really fun! The cover band was pretty good, and combined with the aesthetic of the building as a whole (the walls were made of painted shipping containers which I thought was really cool) it was a fun, relaxed vibe that's very different from a lot of other places in Singapore. It was kind of similar to a Hawker center in that there were different food stalls to choose from, but the options were more diverse. We sampled quite a few dishes, with my favorite being the most delicious calamari I've ever had - it was so buttery and fried to perfection. It's such a great place to go with a bunch of friends to grab a drink and relax, and I would love to go back if I am in the area again.","771":"Cool concept - east meet west; teh tarik or G&T; food court by day with live music at night; metal straws at some stalls; stalls decorated as containers or trucks; $1 back when you return your tray, etc. Unfortunately, because of the remote location, it's not yet a destination, so there are periods during the day when the place is kind of dead.","772":"No no no no! That's the first emotion which comes to mind when thinking about Timbre+. This place has so much potential but unfortunately fails to deliver.When I came here first, I had high hopes, the place has a cool vibe and looks fun. Also, they have a live band which is always a nice touch, even when the band is soso, because, let's be honest, you're here for the food, aren't you?Uhm... let's just say that once you try the food you start wishing you came for the band. I tried Food Anatomy which serves small dishes in blocks, difficult to describe but very instagramable so I am sure you can find some pics online. It was all about the looks though, we did not finish our dishes and decided to go to the Star Vista to get other food.However, since I liked the atmosphere I decided to give the place another try a few months later. Since I am a big fan of a good Kaisen Don I tried out Teppei Daidokoro. Again... fail: it does not compare to the other branches of Teppei, the fish was slightly warmish (for raw fish?) and had only salmon with the tiniest sprinkle of ikura. My friend had a po-boy from Big Bern's American Grill and mentioned that Louisiana should ban these people for insulting their signature dish!I would describe this place as a hipster hawker centre gone wrong but according the website it is a gastropark - to each their own I guess, but not for me.","773":"Idiotic hipster hawker centre.The food here is what you'd find at your random, average hawker stall, except at jacked-up prices.The most annoying bit is the $1 deposit to force you to return your tray. I'm sure that(1) Every diner is happy to pay 5\u00c2\u00a2 for the service of having their trays returned by some auntie.(2) Plenty of seventy-something year-old aunties (who are currently forced to collect cardboard for a living) are happy to be paid 5\u00c2\u00a2 for each returned tray. (The above is, in effect, what traditionally has always happened at all eating establishments in Singapore, be it at hawker centres, food courts, or your high-class French restaurant. The 5\u00c2\u00a2 -- or whatever it may be -- cost is simply implicit in the cost of your food order.)Instead, the timbre+ management decided that to save themselves some money, they'd(1) Place the inconvenience and burden of returning trays on each diner. And:(2) Save money by paying the one-time installation cost of the coin-return mechanism thing (maybe at most a few K), instead of paying some auntie $800 a month to do the job.This money-making scheme can then also be couched under the guise of the stupid and misguided progressive \"returning your tray\" is somehow morally good notion. The hipster fools who love such hipster hawker centres are probably also the same fools who fall sway to such \"progressive\" notions. KNN timbre+ and these hipsters.","774":"New Timbre concept in Singapore, and yay I've always been a Timbre fan since 2010!TImbre has been known for \"Home for Singapore Musicians\" when they first started out. We decided to visit timbre+ for TGIF with zero expectation. My group of friends, 4 of us, arrived at 9pm. We noticed that the space is huge with ample of seats available to host large groups of people. It was fully packed with people at that time, music level is high with the band (Supersonic) on Friday night and a pretty warm location despite huge fans spinning on top of our heads.Within minutes, we were able to find ourselves seated in a comfortable position enjoying the music brought to us by local band. Particularly I love the female lead singer from Supersonic, whose energy level was really high with her singing and dancing on stage. Towards the end of their 2nd set of the night, the male lead singer came down the stage and engaged the audiences with friendly handshake and singing together with the audiences. I thought it was really perfect performances for the night!We split up and got ourselves some food for sharing. We ordered food from Chit Chaat Chai, Teppei Daidokoro, Kush and Two Wings. There are too many stalls to explore and try within one night, so I'm sure this entices multiple visits to this place! We had a papdi chaat from Chit Chaat Chai, a popular indian snack\/street food in India - a dish mixed with yogurt, mini papadum, some mint and indian spices. A mixed platter of yakitori from Teppei Daidokoro, salted egg yolk fries, luncheon fries and skewers from Kush, and salted egg yolk wings from Two Wings. Good thing that the salted egg yolk from fries are separated in a bowl from the fries, we did not get sick over 2 dishes of salted egg yolk in one night. The food selection is really great with so many options to choose from! The only dish I dislike for the night are the skewers from Kush, should just stick to Teppei next time.Now, Timbre is known for their beer and pizza. Beer selection was a total disappointment from this space, and the purchase takes a very long time. There is no sight of Timbre pizza too. There are fridges stocked up with craft beer only, and Archipelago draft on tap. I was hoping to get a tower of beer for all my friends for sharing, but nope, no tower available. I guess there is something they could do about to the payment of beer purchase for sure. There is only 1 counter for payment. Well, but I'm pretty cool with everything, because there's so much other positive stuff over this beer counter.We spent less than $40 per pax for the entire night with good food and entertainment. It's quite worth it with a bunch of friends to chill out. Cab home is problem. We can barely find any cab on the road, so we walked over to the main street and waited a while before we can get home. It's also a great space for family too! I saw really small babies in the arms of mummies, and they are not crying babies!On the other hand, we spotted normal hawker stalls on our way out, like fish soup, fruit juice, handmade noodle stalls etc. We also notice the graffiti sprayed outside the container, all done by local talents. \u00c2\u00a0It's an exciting space with a lot of local flavour, which I give it 5 stars! However, in Singapore, you probably still need some cooling space... or awesome cold beers. I'll be back for more, and I'm so glad and proud that Timbre came up with such awesome space!","775":"Yelpers have described this as an upscale hawker centre and I couldn't agree more. I had the opportunity to visit timbre+ on a weekday after work. At first I was surprised to see that many of the stalls nearer of the street were closed, many of them being local food. As you draw deeper into the warehouse like place, you'll see the stage for the live band and more food options. On a Wed night, about half of the stalls were often, most of which were non-traditional options (ie: French, Indian Kati rolls, Spanish tapas). I ordered a French Onion Soup from the French stall and a Chicken Kati Roll from the Indian stall. My friend tried the Japanese rice bowl and Salted egg fries from Kuchi. \u00c2\u00a0Sadly I was underwhelmed by all 4 items we had on our shared table. There was a live band who sung Bohemian Rhapsody during our dinner. The fans created a surprisingly well ventilated and casual \u00c2\u00a0atmosphere, but the food was unimpressive and not cheap. It was fun to check it out to see what the hype was about, but I don't see myself coming back very often, given how mediocre the food was.","776":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday. It's like a squeaky clean hawker centre with both regular hawker fare and more upmarket stuff. I had the wanton mee with tomato noodles, pretty good for only $4. There's a $1 deposit which you get back when you return your tray, nice to see some productivity improvement there...Ventilation could be better but overall it's a nice addition to the Blk 71 startup cluster.","777":"What a disappointment! I really wanted to love this place, but I just couldn't...We went at 3:30pm on a Wednesday (because that's when we were hungry). I got the impression many places probably closed around 3pm - over half the stalls were shut. \u00c2\u00a0Visually, it makes a great impression - there's great street art on the outside, and the combo of stalls and food trucks and art is really cute on the inside. I didn't have any problems with the heat - there was plenty of wind from the million fans they have,The tray return was a highlight, unfortunately, which shouldn't be the case when you're going for food. There are signs everywhere that let you know how it works, so if you insist on wasting your money here, head to the tray return and claim your SG$1 back when you're finished.Food here ranges from \"a bit pricey for a hawker centre\" to \"WTF?! We're not at a restaurant!\" We wound up spending $26 on Indian food that was served mostly *cold*. Not just room temperature, but actually cold. (Shocking, considering how hot it is here - I'm not sure how they managed that.) \u00c2\u00a0The set meals were a ridiculously large portion of rice with some small scoops of cold vegetables. The butter chicken was a small dish with about 3 pieces of chicken in it, barely room temp. \u00c2\u00a0The yellow dahl was the best thing we had - it was a nice consistency and good mixture of spices. The masala chai was also good - \u00c2\u00a0everything else was mediocre and there wasn't much of it... \u00c2\u00a0we wound up throwing away half of it as who wants to eat cold potatoes on a mountain of rice?The bottle shop looks adorable, but SG$15 for a pear cider and a bottle of water just seemed insane. \u00c2\u00a0There's free wifi but you have to register with your phone number and a bunch of other info in order to use it so we didn't bother.All in all, we spent SG$42 on what amounted to mostly rice and a little bit of cold food plus a nice cup of tea... I certainly won't come again. \u00c2\u00a0Go to a proper hawker centre for good food at reasonable prices, or go to a proper restaurant for better food and and the same amount of money.","778":"The place used to house a hawker centre which offered the cheapest priced food in area with fresh fruit juice priced from $1 and rice with 3 sides from $2.50 onwards. I was so sad that the hawker centre was taken away. In its place, now taken over by atas hawker centre called Timbre+, with prices more than double. The place quite hot and humid. So the number one to do when one plan to eat here is to look for a table in front of the huge fans.Do take note that most stalls charge $1 for tray which would be refunded when the tray is returned. So remember do not give the tray to the cleaning uncle when he comes by.The Garcons stall offers french food. Order is taken through the self service machine. Only cash, NETS and NETS flashpay is accepted here. Remember in the number on the pagar which can found next to the machine.BANGERS AND MASH ($16.30).Spanish Chorizo (pork), German Bratwurst (Pork), Chicken Cheese Sasusge (Chicken) served with mashed potato, double mustard and petit saladThe sausages were quite huge. One of the sausages had a taste which was similar to otah.The well known Two Wings also has a stall here. Remember to show that you have a Pokeman Go account, where you will get a lucky dip which could be a discount or a free drink. Chicken Wings ($8.60\/ 6 pieces)Topped with chilli crab sauce. Not as eggy as the dish found in most zhi char stalls. The version here was more tangy sweet.Food Anatomy is a stall which offered food such as Nasi Lemak, Salted Egg Prawn on Charcoal Bun in cube forms. We selected 3 items on the display shelves which cost $10.80.Cold SobaThe sauce was in a kind of gel form on top of the soba. The sauce was not bad, but a bit too little and let down by the bland and slightly uncooked soba.Pork LasagneColorful looking with black, green and pink pasta sheets. It was quite moist and tasty.Yuzu Cream with Matcha GenoiseThe yuzu cream was light and refreshing, but melt easily, which helped to keep the matcha cake below moist. Could not really taste the matcha flavour below.","779":"This is my 1st time here. The builded up look interesting with the large shipping containers around & high ceilings. The food there are of a sort of local & speciality style. A bit different from our hawker stores.There's a alcohol store, but they serve only boutique beers in bottle (mostly S$11 & above) and Archipelago beer in draught $13.I came here to try the food & I ordered the Wagyu beef rendang with rice, sambal kang kong & onsen egg...S$14.80 + S$1 (tray charge $1, which you can get back when you return the tray)Why 4 stars.....well it gets very warm when the weather is hot even thought there's fan around including the evening time too . If not the warm air around, I would have given it 5 stars.","780":"Damian D'Silva is back, and his mini-restaurant within Timbre+ will make his fans (like me) happy. Lucky me that I work upstairs! His classics like nasi lemak are still delicious. $8 for a nasi lemak, you say? But there's a whole fish in there! Sharing Damian's place is the cute little coffee kiosk, Blue Collar Collaborative. Friendly baristas. Dusk by Slake offers some well-priced and delicious meat roasts. Order by the grams. Douglas' fishball noodles are above average. \u00c2\u00a0Not every day you see a 20 something year old Singaporean making his own fish balls. Clams ban mian is comforting especially on a rainy day. Add extra roasted chilli! The bottle shop is well stocked. American modern craft beer heavy with some Japanese (Baird beer, delish) and uk\/aussie beers (which I mostly hate). Some ciders.","781":"Meh. Cool place. Nice vibe. But the food truck and restaurant spin-offs are such a rip-off. Especially Gar\u00c3\u00a7ons. Among others don't order the miso cod with foie gras. Expensive and such a joke in terms of portion (tiny piece) and composition. I asked the Chef where the radish shown in the photo was and he said \"oh this is just for illustration purposes. We don't have that radish.\" Er. Isn't that a problem? I uploaded a photo.","782":"This is an over glorified hawker centre. It's too bad they didn't do air conditioning. It's really, really hot.Many of the stalls are just okay. There's a good variety but I suspect more effort goes into the decor than the food.Stalls:D's Joint - excellent local heritage food by my favourite chefPortico - paella was a disappointment. Dry and flavourlessGar\u00c3\u00a7ons - reasonably priced French food","783":"was at their opening night and the place is the new happening for west-siders.For those who are not aware, this area is the 'Silicon Valley' for startsups.My old incubation agency was located there and wah lao, now I'm gone, such a haps place happened!I was the only one dining while my partner stole my food.Was ravished and went for the no-queue Chit Chaat Chai, had fish bryani and it was MAAADD awesome. Fragnant and well-cooked, definitely a must-order.There's quite a variety of foodstalls here, and in numerous media outlets, they have been featured. i would like to point out that a few hawker stalls from the previous food centre has stayed, but did not checked out the price hike(if any).Some of my friends were worried that the place looked stuffy but well-assured it was well-ventilated.This is an exciting period whereby relevant start-ups could possibly collaborate with Timbre+.* They have an interesting system whereby you get a dollar back when you return your tray.","784":"Timbre+ is a cool concept where the place operates as an affordable hawker centre during the day and transforms into a great chill out spot with live music at night. I went for dinner as I heard that it is super crowded and hot during the day. There is no air conditioning but I felt comfortable with just fans at night. It is within walking distance from one north mrt station. The front part is made up of hawker stalls which are mostly closed at night. Once you walk in, you are greeted by colorful food trucks and a vibrant scene. The live music started at 8 plus and was impressive. Food wise I had duck confit from Gar\u00c3\u00a7ons. The meat was tender and the serving was value for money. One friend had a bak kut Teh set which included drinks and was a good deal. Another friend had sashimi which was only so-so. We also shared fries with salted egg sauce which was addictive. We didn't try alcohol but there seemed to be a decent selection. Another cool thing is how the tray return area has a censor and returns you one dollar for each tray. Overall, I would highly recommend Timbre+ as an enjoyable place to hang out with friends without burning a hole in the wallet.","785":"Food is expensive and doesnt taste fantastic. Place is always crowded with poor ventilation. I dun personally recommend this place to hangout long.","786":"When board game cafes slowly boarded up, in came Play Nation! Play Nation is the perfect place for hours of good clean fun with friends and family. It is Singapore's largest gaming cafe combining console games and board games. With a collection of over 200 board games and more than 100 Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 games, there is something suitable to inject fun and laughter in family and group gatherings! On top of gaming, they also serve main courses as well as sides to go with your non stop gaming fun!Check out their private rooms, which mind you are not sound proof and you need to have 8 pax to book an entire private room. I visited on a weekend at 730pm. We were charged $14.90++ for 2 hours of gaming with free flow drinks and popcorn which were popped fresh and refilled constantly!I really really loved their popcorn, I think I grabbed 3 bowls of this from the tray warmer that keeps the popcorn fresh!1. Chicken Cutlet $10.90++ \/ $8.90++ (with purchase of a game package)The chicken cutlet tasted like every other fried chicken cutlet you've had at any hawker center. The chicken cutlet portion was pretty huge and I must say, Play Nation was also pretty generous with the fries.2. Cheese Fries $4.90++This is my second time ordering cheese fries and if you have 4 pax playing console games, you get to pick a free side priced $4.90++ and below, and I usually go for this! The cheese is usually hot and the flavour of the cheese is pretty strong. The french fries don't turn soggy at all and they're not too heavily salted either.3. Pancakes $12.90++ \/ $10.90++ (with purchase of a game package)The pancakes didn't taste that great, but their side dishes were more forgiving. If you were craving pancakes, you could most probably spend a couple of dollars more for pretty pancakes next door.The scrambled eggs were done right. They were fluffy and not too salty. The chicken sausages though, were over fried and all of them got stuck together.4. Chicken Chop $10.90++ \/ $8.90++ (with purchase of a game package)The chicken cutlet tasted pretty normal too, just like their chicken cutlet. I'm guessing they're all commercially sourced. But if you do not like coleslaw, you can ask to get it swapped for more fries instead.We got to Play Nation at 730pm, ordered and were done with our meals by 830pm. The staff were very attentive and tried to help in any way possible. They have some of the most cheerful staff I've ever seen. 830pm, we started playing console games till 1030pm after which, we were told to leave or top-up for additional hours of console gaming.Overall : 1) Quick service 2) Wallet-friendly meals 3) Do not expect too much for their food.","787":"Was a part of January's CYME event and came here to check this place out - board games and foods.Located in walkable distance to Dhoby Ghaut, it is definitely a place to try out when you are in the area. Probably passed by this street umpteen times but never noticed till it was a part of CYME. Came here at around 7pm and it was not crowded. People start trickling in towards 8pm to play the games that they offered.There are two floors to this cafe and it was quite easy to find where the stairs to the second floor is at. The interior design was simple but quite artsy I would say especially with characters that we have seen around and some of their own characters to represent the cafe. It was pretty neat interior design where it was a combination of simple yet there are some artistic works displayed on the walls, on the menu and on the display cases which is used to store baked goods (there are lego characters to brighten up a dull case).On one end of the 2nd floor there is a book case with many games and they were divided accordingly to the themes (small labelings on the book cases) and color coded so that you can return the board games accordingly. Pretty well-organized concept. But some of the games I have never heard of so the four of us went for Scrabble instead. Food wise, tried the crabmeat mentaiko pasta. Am in the pasta mood these few days. It was quite ok especially coming from a cafe concept dining. But the crabmeat was cold. Not sure why. The sauce was in a mix of roes and countable small scraps of seaweeds. The pasta was soft and easy to bite. For the price, if you do the boardgames package, it will be -$2 off your dish and comes with a free flow of ice lemon tea or ice peach tea. The peach tea tasted more like passionfruit tea and it came in a bigger glass so most people wouldn't really care for the refills unless you are extremely thirsty.There is only one server serving the food dishes and doing the orders so sometimes it takes awhile before you can ask him to get more food or the bills. And due to the lack of manpower, I had to get the utensils on my own.On the website, it stated there is console games provided at this cafe too. No wonder there are Super Mario Bros and Sonic the hedgehog labels on the table. Overall, it is a nice place to chill at and play some board games with friends or colleagues :)","788":"I will admit that I only came to this board game caf\u00c3\u00a9 for their free wifi, so unfortunately there will be no commentary on the board games or video games. But this venue definitely sounds like a good fit for a CMYE... anyone down? :)It appears that the caf\u00c3\u00a9 takes up two floors of this shop house, and when I visited on a weekday in the late afternoon, only the second floor seemed open. There is a decent menu with things like fish and chips, chicken nuggets, and onion rings, along with drinks like coffee and beer. I settled for a beer, got the wifi password off the menu, and proceeded to work away. The staff played some pop and R&B hits from the early 2000s as background music, presumably to not make it feel so awkward. I appreciated the gesture, as it was a nice throwback! They offer a lot of value for money packages that are for 2-3 hours that include food, so definitely check it out if you're interested in some good, clean fun. Well... it's not squeaky clean fun, considering you can have alcohol on the premises, but still, it's a cool alternative to the same ol' bar and club scene!","789":"Play Nation is a fun and comfy spot to get together with a group of friends and have fun over one of the many board games they have available!There's plenty of comfortable chairs and tables all around and they're easily configurable to fit your group. Dropped by for the CMYE and shared some food and laughs over a game of Scrabble. One thing that stuck out to me as really unique was the music they were playing. The playlist was all very indie, folksy music, much of it from the early to late 90s and early 2000s. I thought it was quite random but enjoyed the trip down nostalgia road.Where Play Nation has a great ambiance and concept around board games, they've some room for improvement in the service and food department. It took me over 20 minutes to place an order as staff was nowhere to be found! I was in the process of calling them to place an order from within their own venue when a server walked by!Some time passed after placing my order and while walking back to my table from a trip to the washroom, the server stops me to say that the dish I ordered is still frozen and suggested I order something else. A good amount of time passed from when I ordered to when I was notified of this!!! I was hungry so I hastily ordered a chicken cutlet dish with fries and cole slaw. Everything was deep fried (that seems to be their specialty) so nothing outstanding about the food.I'd come back to hang out with friends and board game fun but eat elsewhere first.Note: They're planning on moving down the street from their current location.","790":"The perfect place to bond with your friends or partner! There is Xbox and Wii To choose from both consoles are really good. I prefer wii over the Xbox as its more family fun type of games. Recommending Super smash Bros which is awesome fighting using all Nintendo characters. There is also Xbox dance central and Kinect sports which are so fun dancing together. Rock band are good too. Great place","791":"Figuring out an activity for an entire group can be a real headache - drinks, movie, supper or what have you. Play Nation was a choice made one of those random nights after everybody got fed up trying to convince the whole group why their decision was the best one. We found ourselves huddled in this small shop space, going through their shelves of board-games, unable to decide (again) what to play.Board games cafes are an ingenious idea - to me at least. Finally, there is a place where you can get to play all the board games you want without having to purchase any. I played the usual rounds of monopoly, boggle and finally a friend insisted on trying out settlers of catan. That was fun, really fun. It is a game where you try to win dominance over the area and strategise to block off your opponents. Okay, that didn't sound quite thrilling but if you have a competitive streak, you will love it. Heck, you will love any board game.This place also offers private rooms where you can have you own hair metal party playing rock band or look like fools while playing wii. Finger food and drinks are available to tide you through wins and losses.","792":"Nice, comfort food. I had a quick lunch here today, pleasantly surprised to discover the chinatown point branch, after having eaten at sunshine plaza a few times.I had the liu sha bao, which was warm, gooey, sweet and salty at the same time. Only point for improvement is the bun itself; it was not as soft and fine as the best buns should be. On the side, I had fried prawn rolls. Crispy, with a dipping sauce that cuts the oiliness and brings out the umami.Service was fast and efficient. No fancy ambience, just focus on the food.","793":"Wasn't expecting much, so I was quite pleasantly surprised by this place. The liu sha bao was just about average, but some of the other dim sum was really good, like the carrot cake in XO sauce and the chili oil dumplings. Service is pretty fast but not too friendly. Prices quite reasonable, like $10-$15 per pax. Overall, would recommend if in the area.","794":"For great tuna experience, trust the tuna wholesaler of Maguro-Donya Miura-Misaki-Kou! \u00c2\u00a0Really a charming and delicious little find inside the commercialized wonderland of Suntec City Mall. We called in advance and made a reservation at their sushi bar, which sits maybe 10. \u00c2\u00a0They do have a regular dining room to sit as well. \u00c2\u00a0The space is small, but welcoming and the staff was happy to have us. \u00c2\u00a0I don't think mid-week a reservation is necessary, but if you want to sit at the bar, it might be, because space is limited. \u00c2\u00a0Maguro-Donya Miura-Misaki-Kou is a tuna wholesaler first and then kind of a sushi and dining experience second (noted in the Michelin Guide book, just so you know). \u00c2\u00a0With that, tuna is the speciality all around on the menu in various forms and preparations. \u00c2\u00a0If you are looking for an extensive list of sushi choice outside tuna, \u00c2\u00a0this is not the spot for you. \u00c2\u00a0If you are looking for some exceptional tuna, you will not be disappointed. Their menu is extensive, full of all things tuna and what you see is what you get...there were no additional specials or fish items for the day. \u00c2\u00a0Three things of note that makes this restaurant special...tuna quality, reasonable prices and portion size of fish being cut for sashimi and sushi preparations. \u00c2\u00a0The tuna quality is exceptional! \u00c2\u00a0Maguro-Donya Miura-Misaki-Kou is serving up all parts of the tuna. \u00c2\u00a0Having ordered the toro, we were floored with the cut and the quality for such a reasonable price. \u00c2\u00a0We had maybe six sizably cut pieces for like $55SGD. \u00c2\u00a0We also ordered some salmon, tofu (not really great and would skip tofu the next time & stick to tuna & other fish) and a rainbow roll. \u00c2\u00a0The rainbow roll was the largest rainbow roll I have ever consumed in my entire sushi eating life. \u00c2\u00a0The fish on top of it was absolutely fresh and a great portion, but the sushi rice in the roll itself was moist, tasty and really excellent as well. \u00c2\u00a0The largest rainbow roll of your life will set you back $20SGD. \u00c2\u00a0Quite honestly, note that all portions of all items are large. \u00c2\u00a0This is a touch unexpected, but sitting right there at the sushi bar and seeing all that they were cutting and making, we saw the giant presentations leaving the sushi chefs prep areas. \u00c2\u00a0We find ourselves in the Suntec City Mall with some regularity and with that, I think we have found our new favorite spot.","795":"This place had such great sushi!! Although, it is a lot pricier than the sushi you could get in the states. I expected singapore to be expensive so it did not surprise me. I was willing to spend my money here because I was on vacation in Singapore from America. I am also a sushi addict, so I really did not mind spending some $$$ on the sushi st this place! If I were to come back to Singapore, I would visit this place at least once.","796":"Great sushi at a great price if you go for lunch. A la carte prices are expensive though. Don't be adventurous like my wife and try the cooked bluefin. It tastes like it looks (see photos)","797":"This sushi joint is tucked away on the 3rd floor of Suntec Mall as one of the restaurants in \"Eat at Seven\", a group of Japanese restaurants clustered together.Sushi is all about the sourcing. \u00c2\u00a0Where the sushi is obtained from, and who the chef buys his fish from. \u00c2\u00a0MaguroDonya is connected to a famous chain in Japan that is known for its tuna, so we're especially lucky to have it here in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The best quality of tuna is selected by a Japanese chef, and flown into Singapore for our enjoyment. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant specializes in tuna (magur.) so don't expect a variety of fish. Instead, focus on the different cuts of high-quality tuna. This restaurant is for those who want high quality sushi, rather than a buffet of poor quality fish.Of course it's not cheap, but it does beat flying to Japan. \u00c2\u00a0$50 for 5 types of tuna, about 2 pieces each type.The cuts of a fish were a little cold when we got them (and presented on ice), but 30 seconds on the plate, and they warmed up to the perfect temperature.","798":"I love the Xiao Long Bao here and in fact I would say that theirs are much better than the other chains in the city like Paradise Dynasty and Din Tai Fung. In my opinion what sets their Xiao Long Bao apart is the soup filling, which has a better, tastier flavour.Another of my favourites here is the fried pancake with scallion, you simply can't go wrong with that. Great for sharing.And of course, their noodles are awesome. I love the Dan Dan Mian here, and their portions are immense. The first time I came I thought I could polish of one bowl of that plus share the fried pancake with scallion and some Xiao Long Bao, but how wrong I was!And price-wise, two people can comfortably eat for around 30 bucks, so I would say they charge reasonably well. Quite a value-for-money restaurant.But at this particular restaurant is in Orchard, be prepared to queue for around half an hour before you get a seat. Still, a worthwhile wait nonetheless.","799":"Their dumpling soup was delicious!! Fast service. Convenient location. I was here on business and will likely not be returning, but will refer this restaurant to my colleagues visiting Singapore.","800":"The food is ok, but much less good than either Si Chuan Du Hua or Din Tai Fung. Prices are almost as high as the former, and significantly higher than the latter. Service is kind of slow and not pro-active. It is located in the bottom shopping basement, st the same level as the food court and Crystal Jade Kitchen. So, why come here?","801":"When I'm craving for chinese style La Mian, Crystal Jade is the go-to place for me.I will usually have my usual of Suan La Mian but today, I noticed that there is a choice of 8 different types of La Mian to choose from. I opted for the Dragon Whisker La Mian \"Long Xu Mian\" which is thinner then the usual La Mian. Somehow the portion seemed more perhaps due to the thinness of the noodle.We also ordered Xiao Long Bao which was perfect as usual - easy to pick one up without breaking the skin. You get the usual Crystal Jade standard in every bowl of La Mian and your money's worth. What's not to love about a bowl of La Mian under S$10?","802":"I used to like the xiao long bao here but no longer. Somehow it tasted a bit different compared to previously. Luckily the la mian is still good. I like 3 of their la mian and tend to order these. Scallion and \u00c2\u00a0shallot oil la mian - very plain but yet so tasty with the scallion shallot oil. Excellent to have this with other dishes. Dan dan mian - love the slightly spicy and sesame peanut sauce. Zha Jiang mian - perennial favorite with minced meat sauce. The above noodles are definitely much better than Din Tai Fung's version. The spicy and sour dumplings are good but have a thicker skin when compared to Imperial Treasure's version. The si ji dou (four seasons bean) is a favorite with the crunchy beans and salty olives.","803":"Good food overall, but 4 stars because their dumplings (for which they're named) aren't that great. Everything else we ordered (like the noodles with minced pork) was much better.","804":"After reading all the good reviews for this place and wanting more of xiao long bao, we decided to give Crystal Jade a try. This looks to be a big chain with many different restaurants to cater to various appetites. Their Xiao Long Bao restaurant looks to be the smallest of the lot.Service was good and efficient and menu choices are plenty that will appease even the pickiest of eaters.we ordered the following - Steamed soupy Xiao Long Bao - definitely very simple and very flavorful! The soup was perfect and we did not need any soy sauce etc to enhance th etaste.Steamed BBQ Pork Bun Tian Jin style - great choice if you like pork bun - the meat mix was tasty and cooked just right.La Mian \u00c2\u00a0soup with minced pork and vegetable wanton - another excellent offering on the menu. the wantons were super delicious and so was the clear soup! My wife loved it the most.La Mian soup with braised beef belly - The beef was braised to perfection - something I would have expected of a fine dining restaurant! The soup too was full of flavor and worked well with the beef sauce. (I got the soup on the side - dry option)Good food at very reasonable prices and definitely one of the best Xiao Long Bao choices in Singapore - not much variety of xiao long bao but still very good!","805":"Must try their spicy beef noodle soup with handmade noodles, you won't regret it! Another favorite is the xiao long baos. I prefer the colored\/ flavored ones. I usually get a mini soup and xiao long bao - a perfect meal, trust me! Oh, and don't forget to ask for chili paste on the side; it goes well with the spicy beef noodle soup.","806":"My wife and I were staying nearby and tried Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao twice during our visit. \u00c2\u00a0Everything was very good but we particularly enjoyed the Xiao Long Bao. \u00c2\u00a0We have had these in the USA but they are hard to find. We also liked the garlic white cabbage and the beef and mushrooms. \u00c2\u00a0I am trying to recreate these at home knowing the XLB is far beyond my capabilities. \u00c2\u00a0All in all a very nice dining experience.","807":"Average... With decent food. Good for a regular meal with the family or colleagues. Nothing special to shout about. Location helps as after few hours of shopping you just want to sit and enjoy a simple hot meal. Service staff are very attentive and courteous. Pricing midrange.","808":"Level 4 at Takashimaya is where all most of the restaurants are at. Among many of the restaurants there, Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao is one that I visit more often. First, their service is good. There was once when I went there to have dinner on my own. Even though I was alone, it did not feel awkward and the waitress and waiter gave me ample attention even though it was just one customer. I also like the mix of patrons there. It gives a very lively and vibrant atmosphere to the restaurant (that said, the restaurant is not quiet most of the time). Last but not least, the food! The food is tasty, consistent over the past few times that I've been there. There are many kinds of la mian available; they come in different shapes and sizes. Trust me, any one will taste good! So don't be too fussed about the choice. Just enjoy!","809":"Supposedly, this restaurant is one of Singapore's top five places to eat dimsum and Xiao Long Bao's. It was pretty decent and the place is clean, spacious, and the staff attentive. I still favor Din tai fung over Crystal Jade, but it's still worth a visit when you're in Takashimaya shopping!","810":"Besides Din Tai Fung, Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao is another restaurant to go for fantastic La Mian and Xiao Long Bao as its name suggests. With the typical Chinese restaurant setting and comfortable seats, I was excited to start ordering after hearing good reviews about the place. The menu had so many variations of la mian itself and it took some time before I decided on one to order - Suan La La Mian (Sour and Spicy Noodles). I was shocked to see it arrive in a gigantic bowl. The noodles were springy and cooked just right, while the sauce had a great consistency and was filled with ingredients like tofu, black fungus and chicken meat. The sauce was also a perfect blend of sour and spicy and was therefore, appetizing. The service was great; the staff were really attentive and immediately attended to our needs and requests. They were also friendly and polite.","811":"The xiao long bao here is pretty good. In fact, I like it much better than DTF. The skin has a much smoother texture and the soup filling is more tasty. Could be my personal taste. Also I tried the fried pancake with scallion. A little pricey for chinese prata if you ask me, but decent dish overall.","812":"Wow. This has been around forever (ok, maybe 15+ years); one of the originals, this place is reliable, good chinese food and reasonably-priced","813":"I don't think this place needs any introduction. Its Singapore's favourite. I just want to share that i like the xiao long bao, roast duck and lamian here.","814":"To start off this review - I am not a fan of steak. To change my mind, my friend said \"once you tried Luke's, you will be a fan\". And indeed he was right. Luke's Luke's Luke's, what can I say. Everything I fancy in a nice restaurant - modern decor, yet having abit of old chic feel with its booths and lights. \u00c2\u00a0Almost thought I was in a scene from Mad Men and I can just bump into Don Draper having an old fashion neat in the corner. Service was impeccable and our waitress was knowledgeable and offered valuable opinions. We ordered their fresh oysters for the day, and the 400g naked prime rib (medium rare) with half lobsters tail, hash brown for sides and 2 glasses of wine. Was about to order a dessert when the restaurant surprised us with a really sinful and delectable double chocolate birthday cake (it was my birthday). I could probably give it a miss for the oysters but my oh my ... The prime rib and the sweet garlic that serve ... Just typing about it right now makes me wish I'm there for dinner again. The steak was so good on its own , you wouldn't even need the mustard. Perfectly caramelised on the surface and tender and moist inside. The lobster tail was sweet, light and having a tinge of lemony taste. Gosh, and don't get me started on their hash brown. So sinful but decadent with that herb cheese stuffed with it. If it wasn't so expensive though, you would find me here maybe weekly. Well done Lukes !","815":"My 200th review! Boy, I've been on Yelp for a while now!I was taken here for a dinner on a Saturday night and being there reminded me of being in a chop house in the States. The waitstaff here are dressed as they would be in the US, and the place itself is clean-looking, small, and bright. It gets quite busy and crowded here on a Saturday night so be sure to make a booking. There weren't many empty tables in sight. They proclaim on their menu that all their seafood is procured from sustainable sources, so if that is a concern to you, eat re-assuredly here!We started with a tuna tartare (4\/5), and portions run big here, so I am glad my companion suggested we share the prime rib-eye with garlic. The garlic is actually a whole head of garlic oven-roasted. This would probably be the only grouse I have with this meal, with that being that the garlic could have been cut in half and roasted with oil to a darkened goodness to elevate it further.I think the real star of the meal were the sides. I cannot forget the hash brown! The hash brown is a giant plate-sized of very crispy and finely-julienned potato, with some herb cheese stuffed within. This is a winner! I think they should have a breakfast menu and sell this as a rosti. The other sides were equally good, with the bacon, which is actually a slab of pork with maple and a slightly heavy-handed touch of liquid smoke, and crunchy green apple salad on top. Somehow in my head, after my first bite I assigned this dish to an Angmoh \"char siew\" of sorts, so I got a bit confused every time my companion asked if I wanted some bacon. We also got the creamed spinach (3.5\/5)In true 'Murican fashion, we washed it all down with cocktails. I was glad that their Moscow Mules are served in copper mugs here, because it doesn't seem all that common in Singapore for some reason. Dessert! Banana and coconut pie with avocado ice cream, and some really nice crumble on top. Just the right amount of sweet, not overbearing, and very nicely warmed. Oh I do like this place! I would I like this place because of how it makes me feel, also perhaps maybe I do miss America. P.S. I love the musik here. And the service.","816":"Luke and Naked Finn are my two most favorite angmo restaurants this year. I have heard about Luke for ages but have just never made it there till recently. If you are like me, just go there now now now!Restaurant is not big so it does get booked up fast. I could be wrong, but I think if you are not a big group, you can do a walkin and sit at the bar.Yes, they are famous for their oysters as the name indicate, but apart from that, they do have a good menu. Good quality food done properly, none of the fancy sauces and foams. Between 4 of us, we shared:- tuna tatare (love. One of the better ones I've had in Sg. Perfectly seasoned with lots of flavors)- crab cakes (so full of the sweetest chunky crab meat. None of those crap fake crab cakes)- kurobuta pork chop (yummy and succulent)- prime ribeye (my least favorite but still a good piece of meat and a very large slice!)Special mention: OLD STYLE HASHBROWN. Whatever you do, order it. This is like nothing that you've ever tried. A perfect side dish, more like a rosti than a hashbrown. Crispy on the outside, and they filled it with Boursin cheese and spring onion. Pure genius and perfectly done.All the portions are really large. And when they heard that we are sharing, they actually served the dishes with 4 proper portions. No judgement for sharing dishes here. So we were all perfectly stuffed even though we did not order one main course each.Service was also great by Singapore standard. Our server heard that we are celebrating a birthday and they served up an awesome dessert that is full of candied ginger flavor. So so good. While it is not a cheap meal, we felt that it was well worth the money. Looking forward to returning for brunch as they serve up a brunch menu that has lobster roll....and yes, please also throw in the hashbrown.","817":"Went here tonight for the first time. We tried quite a bit during our first experience at this restaurant and I can honestly say it was all good! The Tuna tartare is an excellent starter, so flavorful and well presented. The ciabatta bread that it came with was lightly buttered and toasted just perfectly (not overly crispy). When we realized that the restaurant had some boston roots, we had to order the clam chowder to see how they stacked up; it was wicked good dude. I won't forget the taste, it had some strong black peppercorn, which was perfect with the creaminess of the soup. My wife had the Rib eye \"naked\" and I had the scallops. I specifically ordered the scallops knowing that I'd probably end up eating a lot of my wife's steak. The scallops were presented well, dressed with some large capers, and the sauce was very delicious as well (if I'm not mistaken it may have been butter based?). They offered a side of coleslaw, which I didn't end of finishing, because if found the dressing to be a bit in the strong side. The steak was choice. Loved the seasoning they threw on it, really offered a ton of flavor to the outer side. They also offered 3 fancy mustards, \u00c2\u00a0(though I feel that the steak itself required nothing additional), it was a nice complement. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and the kale salad as sides thinking that the portions would have been smaller. I won't write about those yet because we were so full that we ended up doggie bagging them. Overall great place, great atmosphere, prices are most definitely appropriate for the quality of the food. Enjoyed it very much and look forward to going again!","818":"This place is great on nearly every level. \u00c2\u00a0The food and service were both outstanding. \u00c2\u00a0We sat at one of the three small tables by the front door and it felt like having dinner in the lobby. (My view was facing a plain white tile wall and a fire hose reel. With all of the commotion behind me, I felt like my chair was in the way) The prices say fine dining, but the overall ambiance does not. \u00c2\u00a0Because of this, I would say that the food (and dining experience) is waaay overpriced. Our table for 2 was almost too small for everything to fit. \u00c2\u00a0It was like an ice cream shop table and chairs. \u00c2\u00a0On the other hand, the mammoth bar runs almost the length of dining room and takes up too much of the small shop house space. \u00c2\u00a0The bar could be downsized by half. \u00c2\u00a0 What they really need is a larger space.For dinner, I had the tuna tartar and the \"Luau\" ribeye. \u00c2\u00a0My companion had a selection of a half dozen oysters and the prime rib au poivre (+foie gras). \u00c2\u00a0The shared sides were the hashbrowns (with boursin cheese) and creamed spinach. \u00c2\u00a0The tuna, the ribeye and the hashbrowns were amazing. \u00c2\u00a0The prime rib had a (very peppery) peppercorn crust\/sauce. \u00c2\u00a0The foie gras was nothing special. \u00c2\u00a0The tuna chunks were served on a layer of avocado chunks (tossed in a vinaigrette) and accompanied by grilled buttered bread. \u00c2\u00a0Really memorable. \u00c2\u00a0It could have been a meal by itself. \u00c2\u00a0The luau flavours on the huge ribeye were a caramelized pineapple glaze(?) and I wish the flavours had been less burnt tasting. The tender meat was cooked perfectly. \u00c2\u00a0The crispy hashbrowns were delicious. \u00c2\u00a0The oysters and spinach were just what they should have been, though we wouldn't order either on a second visit.With 1\/2 dozen oysters, tuna tartar, ribeye, prime rib (+foie gras), 2 sides, 3 martinis, a glass of red wine and 2 coffees, the total was $478 for 2 of us. \u00c2\u00a0As good as the food was, I still can't bridge the gap between the high prices and the crappy small table too close to the front door. \u00c2\u00a0A little overpriced for my book, but we look forward to returning for another special occasion. \u00c2\u00a0Maybe with a larger group, we'll be treated to a grown up table further from the front door.","819":"Oh Luke's... Sigh! \u00c2\u00a0Where to begin? \u00c2\u00a0Best burger in Singapore, for sure!!And must order the bacon on the side, topped with green apple juliennes... YUMZ!The lobster and corn chowder is another must.Thanks, Luke!!","820":"The moment you step into this joint, you feel as if you're in a 1920s swing bar (without the swinging and live music. There is hardly enough room for that.). Nonetheless a cool east-coast joint filled with swanky jazz music. The food is overpriced for the portion sizes and location of the restaurant.The food 1. Lobster sliders - Ok. Loved the mini toasted buns (tasted like fried mini man tous @Jumbo) but they were way to small even for me (a 5'2, 110lbs, petite, Asian lady). The lobster bits were ok. 2. Jumbo shrimp cocktail - \u00c2\u00a0BAD. The waitress marveled at their house made sauce which was pretty awful. I can't quite put a finger to it. It felt like someone went crazy in the kitchen and mixed all types of flavors together - sweet, salty, sour etc... Sometimes less is more. 3. Clam chowder - Love! Thick & rich with generous sized clams in them. 4. Jumbo lump crab cakes - Love! Filled with real crab meat not those cheap mixed stuff some restaurants give you. 5. Tenderloin pepper crust $69, grilled foie gas +25 lobster tail +25 \u00c2\u00a0- Sadly, Overcooked. The meat was tough and dry. However, the sauce was good. The foie gas - I passed on. The lobster tail was sweet and good but for $25, the size was measly. I could finish it in 2 bites. \u00c2\u00a06. Oysters & clams - Ok. 7. Cornbread - LOVE!!! My favorite dish actually. Simple yet amazing. This was served as an starter instead of the staple, bread. It was a small, bite size muffin shape :) Service - Ok Ambiance - Interior deco Good. Simple yet classic. Mostly expat crowd.","821":"Excellent service and food. \u00c2\u00a0 Would definitely return. \u00c2\u00a0Seafood fresh. \u00c2\u00a0Excellent steak and burgers.","822":"When Luke's first opened, I was there three nights in the same week. The food here is incredibly good. I can safely say that I've had everything on the menu by now. It's true, the food is not cheap, but it's worth it.What I love about Luke's is that it's a 5 star restaurant that's totally unpretentious. Small enough to be cozy, extremely attentive service, perfect place to impress a first date or client. Now, the food. The clam chowder and prawn cocktail are my favourite appetizers. The lobster roll is excellent too (I think that's only lunch), and the prime steak is melt in your mouth. They used to have this avocado banana coconut tart that was magical, but have sadly replaced it since. Maybe if enough people ask about it, they'll bring it back! Until then, definitely have the choc chip cookies with the stout milkshake for dessert.","823":"I wouldn't describe Luke's as a family place.Nor would I describe it as a place most people would be able to go to regularly.The food though, is almost always top notch, though there are certain things I'd give a miss because they're so much more mediocre than everything else on the menu.The lobster roll, available during lunch, is delicious. Marinated lobster meat in a buttery roll, it feels sinfully indulgent and is absolutely yummy. The burger, with bacon of course, is also very good.During dinner, I'd recommend the Lobster Pot Pie to anyone who likes lobster, or pot pies. BUT. At $99++ a pop (or pot for that matter), it's painfully expensive.And that's really my biggest dissatisfaction with Luke's. The place is prohibitively expensive! Sure the list of must-orders goes on with the clam chowder, the oysters, the clams, the shrimp cocktail, the cold lobster, the lobster sliders, the veal, the pork chops (I find that their steaks, whether at lunch or dinner, are spectacularly mediocre and not worth the money), but the prices!As someone who thinks that $450 a head at Shinji is worth it if you go every 6-9 months, and that $300 for dinner at Andre is, by comparison, a steal, it should say a lot that I think Luke's is prohibitively expensive. It's not an 8 course set menu, or a sushi omakase experience. It's an a la carte experience that can come out to more than $100 a head, depending on what you order, and while the portions aren't stingy, they aren't overwhelming.I'm regularly bewildered then, that Luke's is always so full that can't take reservations even when I'm calling a week in advance. Maybe they don't like me. Maybe they really are that busy. I don't know. All I do know is that damn some people earn a lot of money, and that the food at Luke's is undeniably delicious.And also (to me, at least) excruciatingly expensive.","824":"Great service. Value for money food. Camehere to celebrate a special occasion. When I made my reservations I informed them that this is a birthday and they said they will give a complimentary cake. Didn't have to follow up during dinner. The cake was served when we asked for the bill. I am not so blown away by the oysters. Its not bad but I was expecting something more. I would still recommend this place thou. The steak was surprisingly good. Ambiance was nice and cozy and service was great.","825":"Review is from a dinner I had last year, but it is still with me, and I just remembered I forgot to review it here! \u00c2\u00a0Very small place and kina hard to find. \u00c2\u00a0Its off of Club Street to give you an idea of where it is. \u00c2\u00a0The street is a dead end street to there is no way you can pass it. \u00c2\u00a0decor reminds me of a few seafood restaurants back in the US. \u00c2\u00a0Has that Great Gatsby style. \u00c2\u00a0Food is excellent prepared in Boston Style, fresh and clean and delicious! \u00c2\u00a0However it is expensive and rightfully so, he imports all of his seafood from the New England area. \u00c2\u00a0But if you are looking for a good Boston Clam Chowder or good US NE raw Oysters, this is the place to go. \u00c2\u00a0Defiantly a date night\/ anniversary\/birthday place. \u00c2\u00a0I will be back again...sometime in 2014.","826":"The good: \u00c2\u00a0Luke, the owner, knows his East coast style\/influenced seafood. \u00c2\u00a0Excellent lobster rolls, oysters (which are hard to find in Singapore) and sides (unsung heroes). \u00c2\u00a0I'm also a fan of their beer and wine selection, and the bartender\/server will give you interesting nuggets of info on each. \u00c2\u00a0Location and music is good; once you walk in the place you feel transported to Boston (for those of you who have been, it's like a mini Eastern Standard - one of my all-time favs). \u00c2\u00a0They also run a promo for oysters but the timing is such that because of work I can never take advantage. \u00c2\u00a0The bad: \u00c2\u00a0I get what they are trying to accomplish, but it could be more friendly to a wider array of patrons. \u00c2\u00a0What I mean is that sometimes when I go dressed casually I get looks, and sometimes I don't. \u00c2\u00a0The staff is...stiff...and there isn't a need to maintain such snobbery. \u00c2\u00a0The ugly: \u00c2\u00a0It really comes down to pricing for me. \u00c2\u00a0When I'm craving some fresh seafood, I head down. \u00c2\u00a0But it's not cheap, so I keep my cravings to a minimum. \u00c2\u00a0Tone down the fine dining schtick a bit, as well as the prices, and I'd be a regular in a second. \u00c2\u00a0That seems to be a common theme with places in Singapore: good food and atmosphere + expensive = people don't return often","827":"Steak was darn good. I prefer american-style aged steaks, so this hit the spot. Oysters were pretty rad too. Wine selection was top notch. 4* because of price to value. Dinner for 2 with wine was over $350.","828":"This place is awesome. \u00c2\u00a0 We made reservations a few days ahead of time,and when we arrived we were shown three crappy two seater tables right next to the front door. \u00c2\u00a0I was very bothered and we almost left. \u00c2\u00a0 however, we were dressed up and my wife was in heels so there was no way we were going to wander around looking for a replacement option at 830 at night....so we stayed and we were glad we did.The food was the best we had eaten in Singapore and the music was \u00c2\u00a0equally as wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0 We tried the ribeye, the lobster Mac and the asparagus. \u00c2\u00a0 All equally wonderful and perfect. service was exceptional and if I closed my eyes, I would swear I was in NYC or San Francisco....this place is an ex-pats delight....The seafood served at the other tables all looked wonderful and we can't wait to return for another experience.This place is amazing...except for those stupid two tops next to the door!","829":"Food was great, good place for a date, not for 3 dudes to hang out. I would go back in the future. Service was good and the seafood was fresh.","830":"Very decent steaks and oysters. All in all, worth returning to and very enjoyable experience. \u00c2\u00a0 Expensive. I didnt see the bill, but with wine, oysters steak, you'll be paying upwards of 150+ per person.","831":"Oysters are great - nice selection and served correctly. \u00c2\u00a0Wine list is expansive. \u00c2\u00a0Meat is high quality and prepared and served well. \u00c2\u00a0Great special event place to spend with best friends and a bottle of wine! \u00c2\u00a0Superb.","832":"Luke's was good, with a rating of 3 stars for average in it's price range. To be fair, I had a cheeseburger at a place that bills itself as an \"oyster bar and chop house,\" so I was probably not hitting their signature dish. But I'd been dying for a good cheeseburger and I was cautiously optimistic that this might finally be the place in Singapore that could deliver. With all the add ons (house-cured bacon, egg, and cheese) the price crept up to $42++, so I was hoping to be blown away. It was pretty good. My wife has more refined tastes, so I got to try the lobster pot pie and the lobster corn soup, with kale salad and creamed potatoes on the side. These dishes were all more well-suited for their wheelhouse. They were generous with the lobster, so they earned the price point. ($115 for the pie.) I'd say the winning dish was the kale. Fresh, crispy, well-tossed, and nicely seasoned. And they had some conservative but respectable draft beer (Hitachino lager).","833":"Perfect oysters, crab cakes, tartars and very friendly personnel. Even child was happy.","834":"I enjoyed my food at Bali Thai. The staff were very attentive. I ordered the Basil Leaf Chicken Wrap, Stuffed Chicken Wings, Tom Kha Soup, Thai Tea, and Pineapple Tea. My party of 6 was quickly seated and our food came out fast.","835":"There were tons of food options in the shopping area. For whatever reason, we settled on Bali Thai. It looked casual and fun. I was mildly disappointed with the food. Mediocre food. I was a visitor so I'm not positive on whether it is or not, but it had the taste of a chain restaurant.I had the chicken and fried rice dish, and it was pretty plain. The staff was nice and friendly, so it had that going for it.","836":"Mediocre food. The food is pretty much tasteless. Would not recommend. However, the decor is nice.","837":"Great restaurant. Excellent food. Very good hospitality. They have vegetarian menu to cater certain people. Also, the vegetarians who doesn't have eggs have got clearly makes items. Very handy to decide for the food. Love Red Curry and Pineapple rice. Thai ice tea is great too but bit sweet","838":"Went to this restaurant with a group of colleagues after work, while visiting in Singapore. The Thai food was excellent in every way. The pad Thai, fried fish, tapioca with mango, Tom Yum soup, etc. everything was awesome the service was great.","839":"I was craving gyoza and had been wanting to try this place for a while. The gyoza was really tasty! Thin skin, pan fried to perfection with juicy fillings. The gyoza sauce was a bit on the salty side. I also ordered the black truffle ramen. The portion was small but it came with juicy pork belly, perfectly soft boiled egg, and tons of black truffle! I was pleasantly surprised and would totally reorder this entire meal.","840":"I was craving gyoza and had been wanting to try this place for a while. The gyoza was really tasty!

Not so good: the vegetarian stuffing is really boringBad: located in the basement of the shopping center in the midst of the home appliance section, you can hardly call it \"atmospheric\"","842":"Amazing gyoza place hidden at the corner of Basement 1 of Robinsons Orchard (formerly known as The Heeren). \u00c2\u00a0One of the many things I like about this place is how quiet this place is everytime I visit. Don't get me wrong. It is not entirely quiet (as in no customer) kinda quiet but it's the certain \"zen\" that it exudes the minute I stepped in to this restaurant. First off - \u00c2\u00a0no queue. And second - price is reasonable. And third - good food. Go straight to the superstar when you order - Pork Gyoza either panfried or boil, depending what you fancy. If you want something other than pork, the Prawn gyoza is a good choice too. Besides gyoza, the waitress would recommend you an in house special called jia jia men, a noodle dish which is pretty similiar with the taiwanese version (jia xiang mien). I dont like it as i felt it lacked of taste but found myself ordering my last two recent visits. (i have no hope, i know). Upon serving you jiajia men, the waitress will tell you to mix everything in the bowl and once you're done eating half portion of the noodle, she will then add in \"hot soup\" to it and a half boiled egg into the soup. So for the price of one, you get to enjoy the dry version and then the soup version. Selling at $6.50 per portion, I thought it's a pretty good deal. If you;re still not full, the garlic fried rice and the Nikujyaga (braised beef in stock, i think) are pretty decent. I would def come back from time to time.","843":"Seriously good gyoza! Loved the menu. Great place for the guys to go out for dinner after a hard day. Prices are excellent. Dumplings are made fresh (you can watch them!). Plaza Singapura location was crowded and service was very busy. Heerens location is by far the best one. It is hidden in the basement level next to housewares. Plus it has the cheesy gyoza!","844":"Seriously good gyoza! Loved the menu. Great place for the guys to go out for dinner after a hard day. Prices are excellent.

It is hidden in the basement level next to housewares.","845":"The gyoza is one of the best I have ever eaten. I am usually not a fan of gyoza as it is usually sticky, mushy or has a thick layer of dough.I am pretty much blown away with the gyoza here. The dumpling is nicely crisped on one side. The skin is very thin so you do have to deal with chewing through to reach the filling. I had the pork gyoza so the meat was moist and very juicy. Dip it into the sauce and topped with ginger and you have a winner. There are 3 types of fillings now - pork, vegetables and prawns.I also tried the jyajya \u00c2\u00a0men. I was curious about it as there was an instruction sheet on each table on how to enjoy it to its maximum. It was basically chewy noodles with miso paste, minced meat and green onions. Add vinegar and chili oil (or chili flakes) to taste. I found that to be a bit on the bland side, maybe I did not add enough \u00c2\u00a0seasoning. Halfway through the noodles, you could add the soft boiled egg (the server would bring it over when you tell them you wish to have the egg), more miso paste and a bit of the noodle water to have a soupy eggy noodle. This was much better as the additional miso paste did give more taste to the noodle. The highlight is still the gyoza. Order a plate or three. It is that good. The pan-fried version that is.","846":"I love love love gyozas and this is THE best place in singapore for gyozasThe skin is thin, the filling fresh and tasty and the little bundles of goodness fried to perfection -- With just the right amount of crisp on one side. My two favourites are the pork and the veggie gyozas. The prawn gyoza is ok but i didnt like the crab at all. Every now and then, theyll come up with some funky flavors like curry chicken (so-so) but i know better now and stick with my usuals.Also recommended: the garlic fried fried rice, chicken karage, whitebait, chicken cartilege.Surprisingly, the mixed sashimi platter is pretty fresh and affordable at $28. Theres a special for a bucket of kirins ($25+) but sake is on the pricey side. I wasnt impressed with the salad, edamame (tasted like the frozen ones from ntuc) or the jya jya mienWould give it 5 stars if the other dishes were as good as the gyozas.","847":"This is Gyoza heaven!After reading the positive reviews on Yelp I decided to stop here during a shopping trip at Orchard so expectations were high but I am happy to report that this place did not disappoint.I must agree with precious reviewers though: stick to the Gyoza, I had the basic fried pork kind and these were super delicious! The skin was thin and crispy and the filling tasty and balanced. I also had the boiled crab gyoza and while they were really nice, I still preferred the fried pork ones but this might just be personal preference.A nice plus is their condiments: they have a range of condiments (including sliced ginger - my fave) \u00c2\u00a0on the table so you can mix your own dipping sauce (in my case: heaps and heaps of ginger with black vinegar and a dash of chili oil). Additionally I also had the clam dish (I believe it was called LaLa soup) which was very average, nothing too special to it.Would I go back? YES, I would definitely make a detour for this to fix my dumpling craving!","848":"Gyoza, usually a side dish at Izakaya or ramen-ya, becomes the leading star at Gyoza-ya. Having opened at the old Heeren since last year, it has introduced new items to meet the ever-changing consumers' tastebuds. One of my favourites picks was the all-new Crab Gyoza $7.80, an interesting and flavourful twist to the traditional meat filling. Made with fresh crab instead of frozen crab meat, each dumpling is wrapped with the exact same amount of filling, churned and measured to perfection by the machine.The other new dish is the Tonkatsu Udon ($6.80). The creamy broth tasted like Ban Mian Soup--light but no less oily than a Tonkotsu ramen. The \"udon\" belongs to the flatter Kishimen Udon that is popular in Iwate prefecture. It resembles Ban Mian, but softer in texture.Pan fried food tends to win over steamed or boiled ones because they have the extra fragrant burnt aroma. But hey, the Boiled Pork Gyozas($4.80) are not too bad either. Succulent and well-seasoned, the skin is just slightly thicker thus chewier than Xiao Long Bao. I thought the chefs were pretty clever to drizzle them in sweet miso sauce. Too much meat? There is always the Vegetable Pan Fried Gyozas($4.80), just as freshly made like their gyoza siblings.  If you like unfiltered sake, this is one of the places in Singapore that actually imports this premium brew from Japan.Gyoza-ya also prides itself as being the first to serve this Jya Jya Men($6.50) in Singapore. Not to be confused with the typical Chinese or Korean bean paste noodles, Jya Jya Men is an Iwate prefecture delicacy that ranks together with Wanko Soba and Rei Men (Cold Noodles) as Morioka's Top three Noodles.What's the difference? The noodles and the way of eating. Either Kishimen aka flat udon (same as the Tonkatsu Udon) or the usual thick udon, are topped with Minced Meat Miso & Cucumber and eaten with chilli oil and vinegar. After emptying the noodles, the staff will add a soft-boiled egg, more miso minced meat and some boiling water that was used to cooked the udon. Stir everything and you'll get this greyish broth. Doesn't taste as rich as it looks but neither is it as slurpy as ramen broth. I loved the Yaki Azuki Gyoza out of all and felt that it needn't be eaten as desserts towards the end of the meal. Sweet red bean mash encased in thin, crisp shell that reminded me of my all-time love, the Croissant Taiyaki. Never mind if there isn't any butter since they're probably healthier. Matcha, Sesame and Yuzu Ice Cream ($6 each) imported from Hokkaido are also wonderful sweet endings, though the red beans were undercooked. The biggest draw factor is the price. With the gyozas at an average $4.80 for 5 pieces and other food not exceeding $7, it's possibly one of the best deals for Japanese food in Orchard.","849":"Gyoza-ya, under the care of Akashi Group has made the headline again among foodies since its opening in 2014. I tried to make myself available but every time I'm ready, something caught up. It's kinda sad when I am away from home most of the time with very brief period each time when I return from abroad. But I know I can't find excuse not to visit this time in Jan when I schedule my unplanned return to SG. I have been eating dumplings in Australia and they were mostly made by the mainland Chinese who flock the country of late. But I wasn't expecting the same at Gyoza-Ya, simply that I have read reviews from reputable accolades and I know they are one of my trusted source. I reached the humble outlet prior the dinner crowd: the time reads 6.15pm. There's ample tables to go around for 4s but 2s were almost taken up. The wait staff was polite and obliging to give me a table near the corner of the restaurant when I turned down his offer on the small table next to the entrance, neither a bar counter seat is welcoming, I told myself. I was given a small slip of order list that spells what the restaurant offers. Quite extensive given the size of the humble eating place. The service was very prompt and attentive. My Yuzu Cha arrived quickly and order was taken attentively. I was such a glutton that I ticked so many dishes that they seems to battle for table space when they arrived. \u00c2\u00a0The soup udon was so flavorful that I can't bear to let them drained any unconsumed broth into the sink! The thick slab of char siew was equally good!! Tender and very well marinated, a good layer of lean plus fats goes so well. The JyaJya Men on the contrary didn't fare that well, perhaps the miso wasn't as robust. On average, the udon has a good chewy texture but still, I prefer the round udon to flat udon, the latter has a tougher bite. Gyoza-Ya serves only flat udon. Red king crab dumplings are a must eat. At $7.50, I got 5 plump gyoza filled with juicy minced crab meat, it's a premium dish in affordable price I must say. I like my dumplings boiled every time I had gyoza, even when I had them abroad. The pan fried pork dumplings were excellent too! Not greasy and there's a faint sweetness from the chopped cabbage mixed in the minced pork. The fried soft bone chicken chunks was crisp and addictive. I like the fried batter coating, it taste like the prized crunchy batter bits from long john silver fast food chain! Salty but a delightful way! It's a hate it or love it dish if u don't mind eating soft cartilage. What I least like was the tofu topped with minced beef, the seasoning in the beef just taste weird which I find no words in describing. I'm sorry. But the tofu has a silky texture. I'm glad to have made the trip tonight. Now, I can strike one restaurant out of my to-eat list that goes on and on whenever I leave my home base. Gyoza-Ya, indeed an inexpensive dumpling house that every foodies should at least try once. YUM!!","850":"Read good reviews of this place and decided to check things out for myself. Garlic Rice - both the versions with or without seafood are really tasty! It's a small portion but the price is not high too lah. Tori Karaage - very deep fried but a tad tasteless leh. Rather disappointing...Ramen - they only have one type of ramen. The texture of the ramen is quite QQ so not bad actually. The broth is also the thick pork-based one. My girl actually wanted a whole bowl by herself. Of course we had Gyoza too and yes yes, the Gyozas were very nice. Crispy base and soft steamed dumplings tops and flavourful fillings!! Not sure if I'll return again for a full meal but yes, the Gyozas are worth checking out at least as a snack.","851":"Definitely a fan!The noodles to be eaten two ways is absolutely brilliant! I am only torn as to how much noodles to leave behind for the soup version. Plus, I am easily influenced when dishes comes with runny egg.The gyozas are great too. I prefer the fried version to the boiled version but I like both the pork and vegetables version. The veggies are chopped just coarsely enough to retain the bite and crunch.The rest of the side dishes are all good and decent. Karage chicken perfectly seasoned, garlic fried rice is a nice dish to share, they also have seasonal karage soft bone. Yummy place.","852":"I don't know whats the fuss about this place, food is so so. Food presentation can be improve tremendously. But the place is great, good for hanging out and catching up with friends. And its near marks and spencer so you can do some shopping after.","853":"Yummy gyoza. They've got quite a few varieties of 'em, including curry chicken (!!). Our family liked the vegetable and the pork (classics), and the mentaiko (cod roe) gyoza.The other dishes aren't particularly outstanding though. The garlic fried rice was A-OK. The spicy ramen was way too hot! I'll have to try the regular pork bone broth ramen another time.This is a very affordable place - we spent about $22 per person.","854":"TL;DR - GO FOR THE PAN-FRIED PORK GYOZA AND DONT BOTHER WITH OTHER STUFF!! unless you realllllly want to, then maybe get the garlic fried rice.Ladies and gents, today is the day I learned about the existence of this amazing gyoza... while deciding what to order from deliveroo.And... OMG, Gyoza-ya, where have thou been all my life?The Yaki Buta Gyoza, aka the pan-fried pork Gyoza, is a MUST must must order. I already had high expectation from all the rave reviews on yelp, but I was not disappointed. The thinness of the gyoza skin, the perfect sear, the delicious minced pork that went so well with the vinegar sauce - just blew my mind. It's the absolute star of this restaurant. In fact, next time I wouldn't bother ordering anything else and just order multiple servings of this.It's 5 pieces per serving by the way. I think i can easy eat 20 of these by myself.However since I had to meet the $25 delivery order limit, I ordered other stuff too. Namely:Sui Buta Gyoza (boiled pork dumpling) - meh. Maybe bc it was delivered, i find that the thinness of the gyoza skin, which is what made the pan fried version so amazing, does not transfer over to the boiled version. Also not a fan of the sweet sauce that they douse all over it. I may have liked it more without the sauce.The garlic egg fried rice - this was much talked about on yelp so I gave it a try. And... I mean, it's good, but just like garlic fried rice in other japanese places.Broccoli aburi - meh. This was a weird deep fried(?) broccoli with bonito(?) flakes on top. Not really a fan.Ramen egg - i only needed another $2 to get to $25 so I threw this in. It was a good ramen egg, but it's what you should expect in other japanese places as well.","855":"Practically the best gyoza outside Japan! I loved their boiled gyoza with prawn fillings. The fried tofu with minced beef is very nice as well. I did not order other things, because from what I heard, only the gyoza is worth ordering. If you are not a big eater like me, this place is just FERFECT! It's nice for in-between lunch and dinner timing, the environment pretty quiet on weekdays, it has spacious area with cute Japanese interior. Pricing is ultra reasonable! I will be back. :DHowever, only 1 thing got me turned off, they don't refill your green tea, I mean how difficult it is to do that?!!! And it's not like their green tea is free or tastes super good or something. I just thought it's a mandatory thing to provide free refill in a Japanese restaurant. Sigh.PS: THE GYOZA SAUCE IS BOMB and there is one on every table. Loving the free-flow ginger too! Is it just me or every dumpling tastes better with bunch of ginger, soy sauce, chilli oil and sesame oil! :p","856":"The MOTHER of all Gyozas in Singapore is found in the basement of Robinsons Orchard. I know, i know... you're all thinking, how can you make a restaurant out of a side dish?!?!? Well.., if the skin is crisp and thin and the pork is tasty, then yes it can be done! I'm a simple man. I ordered three servings of the Pan-Fried Dumpling w\/ Pork. Yes, you heard me! Three Servings! One for me, myself and I. Please note that the restaurant offers a version with Prawn or Vegetable, take your pick! To round up the meal I ordered two servings of Ninniku Yaki Meshi, more aptly known as Japanese GARLIC Fried Rice. As an avid rice lover, this rice dish just hit the spot, hence the needs for the extra serving.I'm sure some of you have been in the situation where the food was so good that any form of communication between you and your significant cease to exist. Well, it happened on my first and definitely not my last visit to Gyoza-Ya. :D","857":"Consistently good across the 2 outlets on Orchard. The gyoza pan frying is down to a precise science! New small plates I'm discovering also are outstanding. Shirasu Age is a whitebait fish lightly battered. Nikujyaga is a stewed vegetable and beef small plate. Both I recommend ordering on top of everything else. And I'm happy they've stuck to a limited menu offering so what they do, they do well.","858":"Pleasantly surprised by this little establishment.\u00c2\u00a0Wonderfully fried rice where each grain is a morsel in itself. The cook gingerly chars the rice in a wok with flame.\u00c2\u00a0If ur at the bar, u can see them craft everything on the spot. The gyoza process is started with a stamp and fill machine. They're on timers when on the grill.\u00c2\u00a0End result, fat, plump, nicely pan fried dumplings. I thought they were a bit big when they arrived, but after my first bite, I happily thought otherwise.Fresh cucumber slices (morokyu) to round off the meal and hence a very happy customer!Definitely worth a visit. And happy to spread the word.","859":"We began with two small seasonal appetisers (some thin rice noodle with goma [sweet sesame] sauce) and shredded teriyaki chicken. The noodles were smooth and delicate but slightly bland even with the goma sauce. I suppose the point was to appreciate the texture of the noodles. Meanwhile the teriyaki chicken was a little too sweet and sour, and didn't really taste like teriyaki at all. Indeed it was kind of like shredded jerky.Gyoza is what this place specialises in. The gyoza were bigger than at other places and the skin was smooth and not overly-thick like at some places. However the gyoza were not sealed so the meatballs inside fell out sometimes. Also the taste of the pork inside was a little odd. The gyoza sauce here seems to be a mix of, among other things, soy sauce, vinegar, oil and sugar. This compares to vinegar at many other places.We also had 2 types of noodles: jyajya men and tonkotsu udon. Jyajya men is like the Japanese version of Chinese zhajiang mian - noodles with a black meat sauce on top. Unfortunately these noodles were rather bland - more sauce was needed, and the sauce wasn't all that fragrant in the first place. It got even worse when, as recommended, I cracked in a soft boiled egg, added some sauce and hot water - it was even more bland. The tonkotsu udon was much better, being served in a rich meat broth.We also had seafood fried rice since the portions were quite small. It wasn't bad as far as Japanese fried rice goes (I think because they fry it on a grill instead of a wok it doesn't have much wok hei [smokiness of the wok] that Chinese fried rice has), but there was hardly any seafood inside. And yes, the portion was small to.The individual dishes are cheap but they add up to more than you'd expect! With two cups of green tea it added up to $40.60.","860":"Poor service and incredibly slow. Dishes not authentic. Very greasy.","861":"My fav restaurant to get my Thai food fix! Nara Thai at ION Orchard lose way big time to this humble establishment. Lunch set at $5-6, you'd get a delicious dish at a generous portion. The atmosphere here is very busy esp during lunch time, and thus can be quite noisy. However, you must try their thai ice tea here at $1. Really nice Thai Ice Tea at a very cheap price. I come here so many times for lunch (due to close proximity from my office) and taste wise they are very consistent.My favorites are their pork basil rice + egg (S$6) & garlic pork rice (S$5). If you don't mention anything about the spicy level, by default their pork basil will come out very spicy (at least to my taste it is indeed very spicy), thus, if you don't have a high spicy-ness tolerance like me, adjust it accordingly.Service wise, the servers all are very quick to serve you - may it be tending your table or cleaning up a table for you. When it comes to pay to your bill, if you're in rush, just go up to the cashier and pay there. It'll be faster that way.","862":"Delicious Thai foods with reasonable price in the air-conditioned place plus nice staffs","863":"One of my fav places for authentic Thai food. Haven't been here for awhile but the food still good! Had the pork knuckle rice with egg and vegetables. $5! As good as the ones in Bangkok. The pork knuckle was tender and melt in the mouth. Delicious. The iced Thai milk tea is very good.","864":"Standard has dropped. Not sure if they changed chefs or due to other reasons.Pricing also seems to have increased. We probably won't be back for some time.","865":"Price point - this is a 5-star. Food wise - it is yummy if you are not expecting refined thai restaurant dishes.Walk into golden mile, I totally felt like I am in a mall in Bangkok. The shops are all selling thai food or thai produce. Being local Singaporean, I almost feel like I am the foreigner here.If you are not good with spices, be sure to ask them to tone down the fire. My first sip of their tomyum soup virtually burnt through my intestines!","866":"Never get bored with food here. In my view this is the best of the Golden Mile places to eat. Food is genuinely Thai and not a softened down version to cater to the non-Thai crowd. Prices are good and even with a bottle or two of Singha beer is unlikely to break the bank. Larb Nam Tok is my favourite - good meat and spicy enough. This restaurant is also popular with the wife and kids (Popya -spring rolls- work well for the younger ones).","867":"This is a review of dinner with a friend at Bahn Beer Thai Restaurant in Golden Mile Tower.We went here on the recommendation of my friend. \u00c2\u00a0Good recommendation!This was one of my better Thai dining experiences in Singapore.The ambiance is relatively basic. \u00c2\u00a0It is neat and organized though. \u00c2\u00a0There are numerous photos of notable people who have dined there on the wall.tinyurl.com\/q6hax6fThe service was very casual but relatively friendly and functional. \u00c2\u00a0We were quickly seated. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant was less than half full. \u00c2\u00a0Our order was taken soon after. \u00c2\u00a0It wasn't long before our food was brought to the table. \u00c2\u00a0Do not expect an in-depth service here. \u00c2\u00a0They will not be coming over and asking if you enjoy your meal or anything like that. \u00c2\u00a0But, they get the job done and this is very much aligned with the service I expect at Thai restaurants.The food ranged from good to very good. \u00c2\u00a0I would actually say that most of it was very good. \u00c2\u00a0While nothing fancy, all of the food was well presented.Food Collage Photo:tinyurl.com\/orgfuxwBecause it was his recommendation, I asked my friend to handle the ordering.Fried Pork - These were crispy little bites of fried pork. \u00c2\u00a0With a dip into the sauce, they made for delightfully tasty morsels of fried pig. \u00c2\u00a0One odd thing, after we had almost completed the entirety of this dish, the server brought over a different sauce for the dish. \u00c2\u00a0tinyurl.com\/nq872szThai Sambal Greens - This was the weakest dish. \u00c2\u00a0And not just because they were greens. \u00c2\u00a0They actually tasted quite good. \u00c2\u00a0They didn't have the hot kick I expected. But they were flavourful. \u00c2\u00a0I found them to be very tough and this made them difficult to eat. \u00c2\u00a0I had to resort to some quite untidy eating with hands.tinyurl.com\/q4kfhzcChicken Curry - This was very good. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was tender. \u00c2\u00a0The vegetables were prepared well. \u00c2\u00a0Even though I could see the chili oil, this dish also didn't really have the heat I expected. \u00c2\u00a0I did really enjoy it though.tinyurl.com\/qhtqk5lSeafood Fried Rice - I am not the biggest fan of fried rice. \u00c2\u00a0Rice is one of the few foods in the world that I prefer the non-fried versions of. \u00c2\u00a0However, I did really like this fried rice. \u00c2\u00a0It wasn't \u00c2\u00a0overly oily. It was perfectly prepared. \u00c2\u00a0Unlike some seafood rice, there was a delicate nature to the flavour of the seafood in the rice. \u00c2\u00a0It didn't simply overpower the dish.tinyurl.com\/ohy6rglLime Juice - They have a nice lime juice. \u00c2\u00a0I do not know if they prepare it or not. \u00c2\u00a0It had a very mild flavour and I found it refreshing. \u00c2\u00a0I also thought it was a good match for the strong flavours of Thai food.tinyurl.com\/ocohyyy.Price (Dinner for 2): \u00c2\u00a0$61.62Overall - I found this to be an enjoyable dining experience. \u00c2\u00a0The quality food is certainly the anchor of Bahn Beer Thai. \u00c2\u00a0The service and ambiance are both relatively standard. \u00c2\u00a0It is the type of place that I would consider returning to. \u00c2\u00a0Because of its location, it might be more of a neighbourhood favourite than a destination restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0But if you do not have a favourite Thai spot and have a strong hankerin' for some Thai food, you might find it worth the trip.","868":"My favorite Thai restaurant. Byo your booze without charge. The food here is truly remarkable. My personal favorites areSalt baked fish, the pork with basil leaves with century egg, fish cake, mango salad. These are to die for. Desert is good too.","869":"Once you get past the smell and overall dodgy feeling of Golden Mile Tower, Beerthai is a relatively decent restaurant for a mix of Thai & local Singaporean food.They offer a mix of authentic Thai dishes (Green Curry, Pad Thai etc) with a select few local foods (Chicken Rice etc). The food is quite cheaply priced although not as cheap as a food court. I ordered the Green Curry fried rice with a fresh Thai coconut and came in just under $10.The interiors are nicer than other restaurants in Golden Mile, by nicer i mean at least the chairs match the tables. Seems to be a good place for a quick work lunch if your office is on Beach Road and judging by the variety of food on the menu I'd definitely come back a few times and try out some other dishes.","870":"There is a lot of Thai food in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Bold, sweet, salty, sour tastes - what's not to like? But not all Thai food is created equal and this is my favorite Thai restaurant in Singapore.Golden Mile Tower is a dark little patch on Beach road with charter buses to and from Malaysia and other locales. It is next to Golden Mile Complex which is essentially a little Thai Town. \u00c2\u00a0But Beer Thai is a standalone restaurant a stone's throw from the other Thai restaurants and it is a little easier to find seating here.The food:Expect all of your authentic and typical Thai dishes including pad Thai, pineapple rice, olive rice, fresh fish cakes, mango salad, and a selection of curries. \u00c2\u00a0This is mainly Thai food and there aren't many local dishes, unlike what the previous reviewer stated. What makes this place stand out is the fact that each of the dishes is executed well and has more of a bold flavor than you would get at a Thai Express; the fresh herbs and ingredients are really highlighted here. \u00c2\u00a0A standout dish is the steamed fish with house sauce - the house sauce is a bean and chili sauce that pairs beautifully with the fish. I also love the chicken green curry, green curry rice, and morning glories (listed as kang kong). I haven't tried the \"Lord of the Seas\" fish extravaganza, but supposedly it has won an award so I am curious about the dish. \u00c2\u00a0Any meal ends well with a mango sticky rice, but this dish can run out quickly.The interior is average and the service is fine. \u00c2\u00a0Many of the waitresses are Thai but understand English well enough. \u00c2\u00a0I won't come back for the decor, but will come here again for the reliable, flavorful food. \u00c2\u00a0But don't just take my word for it - the Thai Embassy has used this restaurant for catering (which is why we have tried it in the first place!)","871":"Phad thai & spring rolls. So yummy. Look for the numbers on the stalls, it's down the back of the mall","872":"Bright, airy d\u00c3\u00a9cor. We had the top $110 lunch course, but added $40 to substitute the wagyu beef\/uni\/ikura\/truffle rice for the main course. Beautiful plating, innovative dishes, and overall very good, but not as exquisite as what you get at Shinji, Ki-sho, Ashino, etc. Enthusiastic and pro-active staff, although still learning the ropes.","873":"Have been going there for last 2 years and must say that things have only gotten better. They have new pizzas and beer to match these. New desserts and new starters as well.Recently, attended the sausage festival where their handmade sausages of chicken, pork and lamb were a big hit. They were very tasty and had a good spice flavour.Biramisu - Their version of tiramisu using beer, is still as excellent as ever. Well, the only difference is that now one needs to make a reservation before going else you will be disappointed as the place is usually full quite a lot of times that i have been there.Keep it up!!","874":"Nothing goes down well on a nice rainy day than a hot pizza and this is what this place provided. We walked in here on a rainy evening to the smell of fresh pizza. And to add to it, the place had a good selection of cold beer. Though lots of people like to have wine along with pizza these days, but I still like a cold beer along with that fresh pizza, melting cheese and meaty salami. Reminds me of my college days.Yup, the Diavola pizza was just that. It could have been in the oven for maybe 30 seconds more as I like a bit brown on my cheese but it was still good and went very well with the beer. Didnt try anything else but was happy with I had.In summary, go for the pizzas and beer (and wine if you prefer).. after all that is what the restaurant is named after. Can't think of another place that specializes on this combination. And yes, ask for the fresh chilli in oil for that extra kick.","875":"I came here on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pizzas. They felt wildfires though I didn't confirm. A pleasant chewy crust. Service was prompt though it was a little hot seated outside Al fresco. I didn't like that the place was really crowded and I had to shout to talk to my friend during the meal. They also had a band that was playing outside, so I changed tables to be able to hear myself properly. Would return, but perhaps sit indoors. Great pizza. Prompt service.","876":"If you like to eat pizza at night all fresco with a band playing, this is your gig. We tried two pizzas, one red and one white. I LOVED the 4 cheese pizza. They have a wood fired oven so the crust is divine with some bubbling. Would return but possibly only at night. It must be sweltering to eat here in the day as the sheltered portion of the resto seems to be open-air as well.","877":"I've only ordered from Pizza Fabbrica through ubereats, but with my struggle with finding good pizza in Singapore this would likely take the lead.Cooked Neapolitan style and like everything else in Singapore, pretty pricey, but this reminded me of home and was easily one of my favorite meals. I've had the margherita and truffle- despite the thicker than expected crusts, they were still light to eat and both selections were excellent. Highly recommend.","878":"Great pizza and atmosphere. I recommend the fig, ham and walnut pizza with a little chilli oil. Very interesting combination. Didn't make a reservation, just turned up on a Wednesday night to a half filled place with chilled vibes.","879":"We arrived very late, most places in the alley had closed shop for the night and we just tried our luck and asked whether they were still open and served food.Yes they were, but pizza only - exactly what we wanted. My heart leaped for joy when I saw that they actually had a true wood fire oven at the back.We went for the draft beer, which our very nice server recommended, and ordered pizza capricciosa and a margarita. Priced at 20 S$++ for my margarita, as the least expensive on the menu, it is on the medium to upper end of the spectrum.The pale ale arrived shortly thereafter and tasted wonderfully fruity. The pizzas did not take long either and I honestly don't think I have had such a good pizza for a long time. This place is a little out of my way but I would always gladly return!","880":"excellent place. You wouldn't notice it if you were not looking for an Italian place. In a street where there are many other restaurants. Great food and great service. The Chianti is excellent too. The owner Sumit is very helpful. And they deliver too.In the last 45 days- have eaten 5 times.","881":"Looks fancy but tastes between awful and bearable.The PANCETTA FUNGHI CAPRINO E SCALOGNO - basically goat cheese on a bread base. Tastes fine if that's what you know you are getting.GNOCCHI MELANZANE BUFALA E POMODORINI - overcooked and soggy.TRUFFLE PIZZA - gratuitous use of the main ingredient, again, if that's what you want then you will be happy. Although I find excessive use of truffles is like taking a blunderbuss approach to cooking.I don't think they understand what makes a good pizza. Stick to their products which come in bottles - they have a nice selection of beers.","882":"Great environment and located in the \"Arab St\" neighborhood. While the dishes were beautiful and rather tasty, I must say I'm still much more partial to Cicheti which has a similar menu, but bolder flavors.","883":"Had dinner here with a small group of friends and truly had an enjoyable time. The service was really good even though it did take a little longer for food to arrive but it was a fairly busy time for them. I simply loved their bruschetta..it has the classic tomatoes, one piece with pumpkin cream and another with ricotta. Amazing! we had both pizzas and pastas and everything was really good. My favorite was the snow peas and potato pizza..weird for a pizza but oh so good! And ended we a saffron panna cotta and a chocolate Java cake which all of us will go back for!!","884":"I walked by this place a few weeks ago and looked at the menu. I realize, I couldn't eat anything there. No real meat or veggie dishes, without carbs or dairy.So, when my freind invited me last night and said it was highly recommended, I cringed!Then when I finished my dinner, I was pleasantly suprised.THere were only 2 meat based mains.Ribeye and Seabass.I ordered the seabass. encrusted with zucchini and served with a tomatoe salsa. it was a good 150gs, and tasty.Apparently, the ribeye was 300gm, which would have been too much.It was Very nice! Healthy, light and perfect!My freind and others told me that their pizzas were absolute junk, but I can't and won't confirm that.My friends both ordered pastas. The portions were generous, for pastas, (but since I don't eat carbs, what do I know?), and they said the flavours were pretty good.We ordered a tiramisu with coffee and been infused and even though I couldn't eat it, \u00c2\u00a0my freinds said it was average at best, and that the addition of the coffee and beer ruined it.Overall, the ambience was nothing memorable, although they blared radio music, which was beyond strange and a tab uncomfortable.It's definitely the last time I'll dine there.","885":"I grapple between 4 and 5 stars, this is definitely a 4.5 star place in my book. Just opened for 2 months, this place had showed great promise when we walked past it a month ago. The draw is wood-fired pizza but surprisingly, I enjoyed the pastas better than the pizzas. More importantly, this modern chic italian joint serves a good variety of both craft beers and wines, which is rare for italian restaurants, and they believe in beer and food pairings instead of just the typical wine and food. Also, the prices for the mains are well priced for a nice restaurant, ranging from 18-24 bucks for a very generous portion of food. I had the homemade gnocchi with eggplant and olives and the sauce was sublime. The gnocchi was soft and starchy and the sauce was obviously home-made with cherry tomatoes and eggplant. The pasta with bolognese sauce was excellent as well, a respectable home-made sauce worthy of Bologna, and pasta was served al dente. The husband really liked the four cheese pizza, I liked the taste of the gorgonzola cheese of it, but I had it when it was already slightly cold so could have been better. The green pea soup of the day had a really well-balanced taste of pea with a hint of mint, really tasty albeit a little watery (more pea please!). This is our new favorite italian restaurant in Singapore. Oh, and if you are a fan of bloody marys, you HAVE to try their italian bloody mary, it is divine.","886":"Superb, clean Italian food in a chic setting. I suppose if you are expecting heavy tablecloths and opera it's not going to be for you, but it's perfectly suited to Kampong Glam. And the pizzas are heavenly, unless you're more of a Napoli-style pizza person.","887":"I was invited to experience authentic Moroccan food at Pasha, courtesy of founder Lamine Guendil. Pasha first opened her doors in Oct 2011 and i was told that she is the first truly Moroccan restaurant in Singapore. Located within the compounds of the lovely Sultan hotel (i must do a staycation here!) which is situated in the rich Kampong Glam cultural belt, I feel that the location couldn't get any better.For the uninitiated, Moroccan food is different from the usual Middle Eastern\/Mediterranean. They may have some commonality in the use of certain ingredients\/spices but it's not just hummus and kebabs. What differentiates Moroccan cuisine would be the comforting recipes passed on from generations to generations. Every family has their fiercely guarded secrets that others know not of. Chef Said Ibrahimi, a true blue Moroccan, helms the kitchen at Pasha. With 17 years of culinary experience in Moroccan and Mediterranean cooking, it is without a doubt that diners would get to experience real Moroccan food.Food here is interesting. I prefer their Tajines because it retains the moisture of the meats better. The Lamb Tajine is highly recommended. Save space for their desserts. The Ghriba Bal Gharga\u00c3\u00a2 which is a walnut cake served with ice cream is absolutely faboosh.","888":"Thought it would be weak, but not bad for a French style brasserie. Not exactly Entrecote, but in that similar style. Steak was good, not awesome. Cooked perfect to temp. Fondue was really just melted Brie, but was very tasty and baguette bread was delightful. Service was attentive but not annoying. Fries were good, but I'm not a fan of them. Wine selection was weak, but our Chianti was great. Dessert was a chocolate mousse that was good. Downstairs is limited seating but there's more room upstairs. Definitely recommend for a taste.","889":"Thought it would be weak, but not bad for a French style brasserie.

We were greeted and served by the owner. He took great care of us, and the food was good. I like the vibe in the restaurant with the decor and the music also, it is very laid back and not uptight like more formal places that serve steak. The steak was good, the fries were good, the cheese fondue and desert were also good, but what we enjoyed the most is our conversation with the owner. We had a great time!","891":"I firmly believe that what is cheap is not necessarily bad and what is expensive is not necessarily good. At $19.90 a steak I was hoping for adequacy. Did not get it. Soggy fries, gristly steak. About 30% was gristle. We complained, no one cared. Nail on the coffin? The lava cake was cold in the centre. I applaud the chilli mustard. It's a busy restaurant. I wish them well.","892":"I'm really really surprised that this place hasn't gotten more notoriety on Yelp. \u00c2\u00a0Braseiro is a fantastic French grill in the the heart of Joo Chiat Road. The best deal on the menu is easily the signature Meat (you are getting the steak, no questions asked) served with an UNLIMITED supply of French fries and fresh lettuce. \u00c2\u00a0P.S I wish they replaced the French fries with rice, kidding! Clearly, this is not an Asian restaurant :-)For doneness of my meat, I chose medium-rare. The rib eye steak came out fantastic. I had no idea the French could grill! You also have the option of three sauces: mango, mustard and chipotle to mix with your steak and fries. Don't fret, if there is no seating space on the first floor. There is a large 2nd floor with another set of 8 dinning tables or more. it's a bit neat to see expats living in the neighborhood playing a card game of sorts on the second floor during the evening. The big surprise is that there is a beautiful terrace in the back that accommodates 20 or more people, if you are keen for a fun night amongst friends under neath the stars and in an enclosed outdoor setting.Four stars for the price - $20 for char grilled steak and unlimited homemade fries and the fact you won't find this type of restaurant anywhere else on Joo Chiat or anywhere else on the East Coast for that matter.","893":"Ordered 3 steaks and 1 chicken. Chicken is good & tasty. 1 piece of steak has too much gristle. The other 2 are ok. Ok quality, I went there with higher expectations because of the 4 stars, but not expecting Ruth's Chris level. Came out disappointed. Gave us a tiny bowl of salad for 4 person though can ask for more. Fries are too soggy. Won't be back again for sure","894":"Value for money budget steak with all you can eat salad and fries.Despite the Brazilian name, it's more of a steak frites place. The owners of this restaurant are French. The menu is simple, S$19.90 gets you a sirloin and unlimited fries and salad. To upsize your steak, pay $5 extra.By all means it's not the best steak, you get what you pay for, really. Beef quality is only a small notch above Aston's or Jack's place. Fries are crispy out of the fryer, and for the salad, you get butter lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. If you're in the mood, they do serve caipirinhas. :)4 stars cos it's value for money, but don't come in here expecting Morton's or Ruth's Chris. The food quality is only 3, but on a day when you crave steak, it's fine, really.","895":"I could eat here EVERYDAY!! My favorite place to eat on Joo Chait! \u00c2\u00a0I love Braseiro!! Ran by a young couple, you really \u00c2\u00a0feel like you are going to a friends house for some amazing BBQ. The prices are great and the meat is always cooked to perfection! Ohhhh... And free flow salad and fries, what more do I need to say!","896":"Decent steak with free flow of fries (super addictive) and salad. Nice chill out place and very good service given that I only see the owner serving!! Always checking each table timely and we don't really have to call him to get something or to be served.","897":"Love love LOVE this place! Found it online while in Singapore. My mum and I were craving a steak. We took an Uber over to Braseiro. 2 storey little place, cute terrace on the second floor. The owner was so sweet...she is french, she and her boyfriend opened the restaurant, combining elements of french food (think steak frits in a Paris brasserie) and Brazilian ( think perfect Caipirinha in a bar in Rio). The steak was cooked perfectly..the homemade fries were to die for. Did I mention how delicious the Caipirinhas are?? Now for the kicker: $19.90 for the 200g steak and the fries and salad are bottomless! So glad we came here...you should too!!","898":"I really want this place to succeed. In a neighbourhood overwhelmed with burgers, fish and chips, EPL, and $15 beers, this is a welcome alternative. Prices are almost suspiciously reasonable for an area that seems to try its hardest to out-expensive Holland Village. The menu is simple and we like that: Choose your meat, and get unlimited fries and salad with it. Don't be fooled by the small downstairs space, they have an upstairs, both indoors with aircon as well as a small roof terrace. Upstairs is quieter, Joo Chiat isn't exactly a pedestrian zone. Owners and staff are nice and helpful and give the place a personal touch. Food is good. Another plus: They're open until late, including the kitchen. I believe there's food until midnight. There's many food choices in this part of town, but this brings something new to the mix.","899":"Best rapport price\/quality for a red meat restaurant in Singapore, extra !This restaurant, just opened recently in a shophouse in the center of joochiat.IF you go there, it's for meat, and eat a really good steak with french fries and salad free flow.For chicken lover, there is also but according to me, best to order red meat.Price are affordable (less than 30sgd) and you can choose your meat size (200\/300\/400 g) and how it will be cook, and are includ GST.On the final bill, no GST, only service charge add.Don't think you go there and find the same food as other meat restaurant like Ashton (serving steak too cook and hard). Here all the meat is very tender and the cooking as requested.To recommend","900":"Boutique Style Bistro with Nice Hot Food & Ice Cold Beverages. Very friendly service. No 7% GST & 10% Service Charge = 17% Savings. Also a very clean environment with super hygienic toilets!","901":"Great place to chill in Singapore , amazing food. Good service which is hard to find in Asia. If you all want meals served at same time. Prices are great. Also owner runs the place. So any issues which will be few are addressed immediately Was customer when they were at another location. When they closed I was crushed. So glad the opened new location. If you live here or just visiting it's a definite must visit , you'll get hooked like me. Family place early and good party spot late.","902":"Good brunch spot - favorites include the crab eggs benedict and symmetry big breakfast. Pleasantly surprised by the taste - very good execution - something you don't find in a lot of brunch places which tend to make me feel like \"all eggs are the same.\" Nice funky ambiance - good for catching up with friends.","903":"I only come here for coffee and the flat white is good. I also like the shape of the bottle for the cold brew. Looks like a medicine bottle which is quite cool. The place is often busy and crowded. Get a reservation if you are coming in a big group. The staff is friendly and the service is on point.","904":"Quaint spot. I had the burrata and portabella egg toast, which was delicious and filling. The green tea latte was well made. Brunch is heavily pork-based, so if that it not part of your diet, your choices are limited. My friend also doesn't eat red meat, so limited options between the two of us. Service was friendly, but we finally asked for a carafe of water because the glasses were small and the staff wasn't watching all the time (we drink a lot--not a ding, just an FYI to those who might also drink a lot of water).","905":"Reservations highly recommended for this place. Parking was also hard to find. Has a healthy buzz and a relatively dark interior (probably because it is a bar at night), so not the best place for personal conversations. Food's decent but not great - very pricey for the quality. Coffee ($5.50) is cute, with the gingerbread cookie, but not fantastic. Matcha ($6.50) could be richer and less milky. We got the salmon on toast ($24) and the minute steak ($29). For the salmon on toast, eggs were perfectly poached, the components went very well together. Special mention to the artisanal toast which held the salmon, avocado and eggs well. Particularly enjoyed the beetroot yogurt on the side. The minute steak was ok, but the sausage wasn't anything to shout about. Food is more photogenic than delicious. The bill came up to $76 in total. Pricey.","906":"Pretty good eggs Benedict, however, the mushroom tapenade overwhelmed the dish. Spanish breakfast was decent as well, but doesn't outshine that of Wild Honey's. Nice hipsterustic atmosphere without hipster smugness and judgementalism.","907":"Hipster ambiance, beautifully presented and delicious food, and great service!The four of us came for lunch and shared the Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallop, Super Brunch, Duck Leg Confit Croissant, and Saikyo Miso Cod & Mentaiko Carbonara. Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallop:- Though it was a good combination of potato and scallops, the dish would have been more appreciated if more than 2 scallops were given... especially since it was a whopping $21 for a starter. \u00c2\u00a0Super Brunch:-I loved the quinoa, 2 eggs smiling sunny-side up, and mushroom in this dish! The chicken sausage was a bit salty but the veggies helped complement it. Duck Leg Confit Croissant:-Bravo to its scrambled egg and duck confit! Saikyo Miso Cod & Mentaiko Carbonara:-The cod was absolutely delicious! It was cooked perfectly, giving it the right moist texture. The carbonara was not too creamy too, making it a light and hearty meal! I adored the chai latte and and gingerbread man that came with--which is now happily settled in my tummy...oops! Note: Brunch is only available on weekends and wifi is available upon request for password. Also, when using the sink around the restroom area, you have to step on the lever in order for the water to come out.","908":"Dropped by here on a public holiday and like minded customers decided to stroll in here after realizing that most of the cafes around this area are not open for business on that day - dinner.We walked in and there were still quite a number of seats available and so we were ushered to one of the seats near the entrance. As it was my first time as well as my friend's, we had to ask the waiter and waitress for the recommended dishes. Foie Gras burger and the risotto was one of the recommended ones but since two of us are sharing the meal, I decided to go for Symmetry beef short ribs as the main dish and crispy baby squids and black pepper aioli as the appetizer. It was almost 8.30pm when we stepped into this cafe and we were pretty hungry. By just looking at the menu, we do not really know what to expect as some unfamiliar ingredients popped out from the menu. I was glad that the waiter and waitress were able to give similar recommendations which aided us to choose the dishes pretty quickly.As I continue to checkout the design of the restaurant, I also noticed that the menu we were holding were in symmetrical order as well (opening and closing). While waiting for the foods to arrive, more and more customers trickled in and we were asked whether we could switch tables and we gladly did (it was a better move as the next space was spacious). The orders started to come in a few minutes after our switch.The squids came first. It looked rather normal besides the black sauce next to it. I tried the squids without the sauce first and I could taste the crispiness from the flour of the squid. The squid itself was chewy. And adding it to the sauce it added more interesting taste to it. Light on the tastebud but the black pepper in it were pretty strong. Great combination.The beef ribs came next. The tenderness and juiciness from the beef were beyond words to describe. The fats were \"melting in the mouth\" according to my friend's comment. The mashed potato on the dish were creamy and good mix with the edamame provided. Instead of a cafe kind of dish, I will consider this dish to be like fine dining's.After clearing up what's on the plates, one of the servers came over and checked with us whether we would like desserts to conclude the day. I was eyeing on the Hazelnut and chocolate Mille Feuille for awhile and since we are there, decided to give it a try. Like I mentioned earlier, I was clueless on what's on the plate even though we were still holding the menu. For this dish, I like the chocolate ice cream and the crumbles beneath the ice cream. The others were not too satisfying for my taste palates (too bitter or too sweet).Overall, the dishes here are very interesting. They even have brunch menu available on weekends and lunch menu on weekdays. One thing I have to minus a star is the pricing. 1 main + 1 appetizer + 1 dessert added up to around $85. Try out those recommended dishes and let me know what's your inputs :) Bon Appetit!","909":"Hate to need to deduct a point so fast, but tonight the nachos were made with what seems like very low quality cheese sauce made from a jar. Like frito lay style. And they were not cheap. The quinoa salad was good but small.Today's meal was three stars, last one was five, averages out to four. Stick the the breakfast food would be my advice.","910":"I've only been here once but I would definitely go again. The beef hash breakfast with scrambled egg had a lot of flavor. Cappuccino was well executed.","911":"I like the place and the hipster ambience but the food is not impressive.It is definitely more than decent with good thick robust coffee. And the portions are very hearty. \u00c2\u00a0They also have items on the menu that are good for sharing.They do take reservations so that makes it easier if you are a big group.","912":"So, I had the Symmetry Benedict and a Hazelnut Latte today. I must say while the egg benedict was yum, the price tag was just not justified by the portion served. I could easily go to another place and get a big breakfast with the same price. Latte was fine. It came with a little gingerbread man which i thought was cute. The other reason that made me rate 3\/5 was, the waitress was too quick to give our seats away when I missed to take their call. I would suggest the cafe to allow some grace in the future. Imagine, the guest made their reservation and then they left to take a walk or went to the restroom. And then the cafe called but the guest failed to answer for whatever reasons. Would it be too much to wait another 5 minute so you can make another call to the guest and make sure he\/she is still coming? Just saying....","913":"Unfortunately I feel like Symmetry has become a victim of it's own success. I arrived bright eyed and bushy tailed and left absolutely raving...the first time around. The subsequent visit? Not so much. The space is so quaint and lively, but wasted on the fact that it's a little too obvious that squeezing more customers in, is more important than making sure that everybody is comfortable. Sitting outside in the heat actually turned out to be a much better option!However, one thing remained the same both times - I think their Truffle Fries are outstanding and from what I've had, the best in Singapore. The coffee is also great and I'm sure we've all tired to \"drown\" our little gingerbreads in latte foam every, single, time.The breakfast dishes that I've tried were so excellent during my first visit, but unfortunately second time around - nothing stood out. The Aglio Olio was downright crucified and frankly, considering the serving, a bit of a rip off. The Wildberry Waffles weren't much better either; all the components were overly sour and there was no balance or hit of sweetness.I'm really rooting for Symmetry to shape up and return to it's former glory, it was definitely well worth the hype back then and here's hoping that they can keep improving!","914":"My wife and I were staying in Singapore for a few days so don't know what the usual cost is like but i would have given this place 3 $$$ instead of the 2 it had on yelp.This place has a nice relaxed feel, and even though we arrived about 830 on a Saturday it was only about 1\/3 full. Wait staff were attentive and helpful and recommended a few dishes off the bat which was good as it's a fairly long menu and were terrible at ordering. My cutlery was dirty though and had to ask to get it replaced.The pork belly was great, simple and delicious, and my wife had the salmon, which was a tiny bit undercooked but excellent otherwise. Cocktails were amazing - worth the spend, try the Symmetric.Annoyingly GST or whatever its called in Singapore is not included in the price on the menu, so if you're a kiwi, aussie or brit factor that in. Personal bugbear - i really hate when places do this.TL;DR: Food really was excellent, as were the cocktails, but expect to pay a premium for it.","915":"If your looking for a place to chill out while grabbing a drink or just to meet up with friends. Definitely check this place out. It's not just a bar. The vibe and atmosphere is unique on this little island.","916":"good, delicious brunch, in a very cool hipster hangout in the still-cool neighborhood of kampong glam. so this place, it's imminently likable. is it weird that I think that someplace this cool ought to be rather irritating? it's done up in concrete, the hostesses are young trendy females, the baristas wear baseball hats and graphic tees, and the menus are all done up illustration-style. but the food is delicious, the wait isn't long - and there's a good, orderly queue system.very, very likable.the portions are pretty reasonable. a big breakfast came with smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, sauteed mushrooms, and a mushroom with toast - and my breakfast trio was a cereal parfait, softly-cooked truffle egg en cocotte and toast with some sort of berry butter. the eggs were soft and delicious, and while I would have preferred a more oaty muesli in my parfait, it was all good.that same crunchy flake and cluster cereal melange made another appearance in my order of granola - but this time with a dark purple berry compote and deliciously creamy greek yogurt. mix it up, let it sit and soften slightly, and it's plenty breakfast for a cereal lover.so great food, and good sizes.they also have one of those electronic queuing systems where you take a ticket number and they text you when your turn arrives, so while you might have to wait outside in the abominable heat for a bit (I did say this place was trendy and popular, right?), at least you know there's a system behind getting your seat (amongst the things I brought back from london was an obsession with queues and an immense annoyance when queuing norms are flouted).very, very easily return-able.","917":"I echo the previous review. I don't often give one stars out... maybe I should give 2 because the staff were more than attentive. This place is for you if you like superficial and vacuous hang outs - its got the stereotypical hipster decor, nice music and cool looking people hanging about. But I am not here for that. The food is apt for this place: it delivers high on presentation and very little on substance.I ordered the 'flan' which was anything but. A thin crust tray with slimey mushroom sauce, with 2 pork cheeks and an egg sitting in it. When asked if the food was ok, I said this wasn't a flan and their explanation was a 'deconstructed' flan. I don't expect bar staff to go post-modernist on me. Surely the point of a deconstructed flan is that one is such a master of flans that one can improve upon it? Its not an excuse for not being able to make a decent flan - one that would send you back to the days when your culinary mum would have made for you after playing a game of football. It was also pointed out that the pork was tasteless and should have more flavor which was presented as feedback to the chef. But there was no attempt to satisfy the disappointed customer. Think it was around 23 dollars plus service charge plus tax for the Duchamp of dining.","918":"Oh Symmetry. Why have you fallen so far so fast? I remember when you first opened. I bounced in all wide-eyed and innocent, was seated promptly and fed delicious coffee and scrumptious food in a timely manner. I felt like this was a standout for Singapore's crowded brunch\/cafe scene. I felt like I'd discovered a new world full of wonder, magic and beauty.Fast forward 6-12 months and cynical business management and poor execution have sunk an otherwise promising business. It was Chinese New Year and Symmetry was one of the few places open. I'm not complaining, I still need places to go on public holidays. But when a restaurant remains open it's a warning sign. It's more difficult to get produce, there are less places open so crowding is a danger. But none of those things should be an excuse to provide a sub-standard service or product. Which on this occasion Symmetry most definitely did.Let's see. Configuration of the tables had changed to cram in more diners so we were cheek-by-jowl. I felt like I needed to execute a triple somersault to get from my table to the door and back. Not comfortable.Then it took 45 minutes to get two plates of moderately fancy eggs. We're not talking about slow-roasted ox-cheek and duck confit here. Just some slightly fancy modifications on poached eggs, that's all. Hey your kitchen can't handle a full restaurant at lunchtime? That's a problem for you. If you have 30 covers and you can't feed 30 covers on a limited lunch menu with simple dishes then you shouldn't have 30 covers. Maybe you shouldn't be in business. Just sayin.So how's about those poached eggs? They were frankly pretty terrible. I ordered the \"sur le plat\". Hey everyone - don't give your dish a fancy French name, it raises expectations. The sur le plat was like virgin sex: quick, uneventful and unsatisfying. It was subtle like beating someone over the head with a fire extinguisher. Maybe it gets the job done but it isn't worth the effort.I was promised \"artisanal bread\" and good quality sausages. I got a crusty piece of butter-slathered cardboard and what tasted like supermarket-quality frankfurters chopped up and served lukewarm in a saucepan. And the eggs. Oh the eggs. How do you undercook poached eggs? You know those half-boiled eggs you eat with kaya toast? They have a very unique consistency somewhat reminiscent of what one might use for inseminating the *other* kind of egg. Y'all know what I'm talking about. And that's fine. I love half-boiled eggs. But I ordered poached eggs. And these eggs were definitely not poached.I'm sorry Symmetry but even a halfway passable coffee and service with a smile did not save my abominable experience. Never coming back.","919":"I love corned beef hash and Symmetry's Hickory Corned Beef & Hash just tops my list! The waffles are also good so make sure you save some stomach space for them. Great coffee and indeed this is as good as it gets","920":"First up, I'm not as discerning in the taste bud department as some others. I'm actually rather plebeian so subtle, nuanced eats and I don't really click. Next, I view hipster\/indie joints with a morbid fascination. On one hand, it's revolting. I can't cycle so I don't see the allure of a bamboo bike. On the other hand, I quite like cement\/brick walls and exposed pipes. Anyhow. You need reservations for this place. They write your name, time slot and number of pax on a rock so you know which table is yours, which is.. interesting because it looks like a bible verse. You know- Timothy 3:16 that kinda thing. Eggs are supposed to be done well here, so eggs it was. I had two eggs in a pepper puree sauce populated with an incredible amount of chopped sausage, while the other diner had eggs ben with maple glazed bacon. And because we were greedy, we had a cold cut platter to share too. And the eggs. Oh the runny eggs. My inner auntie frowns upon ordering a pair of eggs for $20 when you can get 10 for $2, but she's easily placated with cold cuts. Which were ok, really. Smoked salmon, parma ham and some cured meat thing that came with blue cheese and another slab of even smellier cheese. I do love me some smelly cheese. The mains fared much better though, and the other diner was pretty happy with the nosh. As the day wore on (we were there at 11), the place was absolutely buzzing with activity, but happily we were free to just chill. On the downside, the place is really cramped. Every time someone walks behind me, I get bumped, which is all the time. You can't really tell wait staff from diners, which can be a bit confusing since everyone's wearing those tortoise shell rimmed spectacles, sporting a tattoo or turned up pants. And the price point is on the high side for a place located opposite a cemetery (cemetery. symmetry. is there a link?). Would I return? Well, yes, but only when it's pay day.","921":"I decided that I liked Symmetry when i first set sight on the cafe but by the time i left, i decided that i was in love with it. You know that feeling when you met someone for the first time but felt comfortable talking about everything and anything like you've known each other all your life? That was Symmetry for me. It knows me inside out.Caf\u00c3\u00a9 by day, restaurant bar by night, Symmetry is a cosy and laid back spot in the Bugis area, situated within Jalan Kubor. The decor, the vibe and the music were all too familiar to me. We have the same great taste in music for the songs they played were all on my favorite playlist. ;) The lunch menu isn't as extensive as the brunch one but the selection is still wide. I had to have my eggs regardless so it was the Poached Eggs for me. The waiter recommended this over the Croque Madame and i must say that i was very pleased with this.These were runny as though they were more soft boiled than poached. The creamed potato mash went nicely with the sunshine yolk. The spicy chorizo and caramelized shallots were amazing with the sweet and smoky flavors. Bacon was honey glazed but still maintained the saltiness. Oh and the blueberry butter cream was a nice touch to the entire dish. I really loved how the different flavors came together. The coffee tasted good but the foam wasn't made well. As i was trying to get a good shot of the latte art, i noticed that my foam started to sink and bubbles started popping. Hmm... They took quite a while to get our coffee and it was only served after our mains have arrived. Something needs to be done about that.I will probably be back to try the other items on the brunch menu. They look too good to be passed over. See you guys there sometime!","922":"Ambience is good, food was tasty and really friendly staff too! Accessible location, only downside I feel is that it is a little pricey (:","923":"I love brunch but hate boring brunch places. \u00c2\u00a0Ultimately it comes down to the food but its a bonus when its a fun atmosphere. \u00c2\u00a0I really enjoyed symmetry. \u00c2\u00a0The food was great. \u00c2\u00a0I found the menu to be interesting and well put together. \u00c2\u00a0Its not standard and they seem to be trying to make interesting dishes. \u00c2\u00a0I liked everyone's plate except my own. \u00c2\u00a0It wasn't that it was bad. I had the symmetry eggs sur le plat. \u00c2\u00a0It just had a little too much sausage and not enough flavor. \u00c2\u00a0But the eggs ben was awesome as was the pork collar croissant. \u00c2\u00a0They have a nice selection of beer and the prawn popcorn and bacon cheese balls were super tasty. \u00c2\u00a0The staff were very nice and attentive. \u00c2\u00a0They could give nice suggestions aside from the usual blank stare when you ask whats good. \u00c2\u00a0The food came quick. \u00c2\u00a0Everyone at brunch enjoyed it and I would recommend it easily. \u00c2\u00a0I didnt feel the price was that bad. Its a little more than average but not any more than a place like PS Cafe and I find the food to be more interesting. I'll be going back to check out dinner.","924":"(Note - this review and rating relates to coffee only). Espresso - dark reddish brown crema, roughly correct volume for an espresso shot, maybe a little high. First impressions were of a slight acidity, which faded slightly. and is tempered by the flavour of a more earthy, darker roasted bean in the mix. The end result is a balanced shot. Cappuccino - latte art, which is always a good sign - microbubbles give a smooth mouthfeel, but the underlying characteristics of the espresso were still present - they were muted but not eliminated. This was a combination of milk, foam and espresso that complemented each other.The shots are quite potent though, I definitely felt the effects afterwards. Symmetry is also home to a Slayer espresso machine, which can pack a double ristretto into each shot - if you are in any way sensitive to caffeine, please bear this in mind when ordering drinks!It's slightly more expensive than other cafe's, with an espresso and a cappuccino costing roughly $12, but the quality of coffee is good. Staff were attentive and happy to talk coffee, and made a good effort to ensure that the coffees served were ok.","925":"Delicious and best place for Brunch in Singapore!Who doesn't love brunch?Symmetry is a caf\u00c3\u00a9 by day, restaurant bar by night. My bf and I decided to try this famous place for brunch.This place is really popular and I strongly suggest you make reservations prior to making a trip down.Symmetry Caf\u00c3\u00a9 is situated between Bugis and Lavender MRT station at 9 Jalan Kubor Road, opposite Santa Grand Hotel. Food is definitely good. We start off with Potato Fries with Truffle Oil Emulsion that had black truffle salt and Parmesan cheese evenly sprinkled, recommended for starter.The Big Breakfast- eggs of your choice, maple glazed bacon, smoked salmon, chicken cheese sausage, saut\u00c3\u00a9 mushroom, hashbrown, mesclun, berry butter and toast. Super satisfying, especially the scrambled eggs are so soft and moist. Tiger Prawn Aglio Olio - To be honest, we had better ones elsewhere, so this is neither yay nor nay. Prawns were succulent and fresh but paste will be better if its softer. Waffle - Mix berry compote, peanut butter, chocolate hazelnut, maple syrup, chantilly cream, blueberries ice cream. Warmly served waffle with its thick spread of peanut butter and blueberry ice cream\/ small berries toppings made this dessert a divine indulgence! Overall, we really like Symmetry. Decor in the cafe is a mixture of rustic and eclectic elements, food is very good, price is slighly on the high side but the quality of the food makes up for it. For full review and photos, you can find out more at eatandtravelwithus.com\/2\u00e2\u0080\u00a6","926":"The eggs benedict was kind of blah. They have a caramelised onion under the poached egg that gave the dish a really confusing flavour- sweet and savoury and not in a good way. I was not able to finish it. And I was hungry. Hmmm...The tables and chairs were really close to each other. You were either pressed against the wall, pressed against your dining companions or the other patrons seated behind you. And you have to squeeze to get to your table, to the washroom and also on the way out. This would probably be very acceptable if the food was good but this was not the case. Now on to the not so bad. I guess the pluses are that you can actually reserve a seat, the above average service and the cute woody decor of the cafe. But this would not be bringing me back anytime soon.Hence, the below average food and uncomfortable environment earns Symmetry 2 stars!","927":"Initially, I was hesitant to try this place because of the mixed reviews I've read. On one end people raved about their brunch & ambiance and on the other critics condemned their steep prices and mediocre food. After trying it for myself last night I see the merits of both sides' arguments. \u00c2\u00a0Firstly, it does have a beautiful ambiance! We went there on a rainy night and it seemed almost as if you stepped into someone's house. Someone with a good vintage\/indie taste, of course. The contemporary art pieces mixed with the occasionally 1960s pin-up posters creates an atmosphere of old world meets new world. The wooden furniture and shelves contrasted against modern cutlery and crisp white plates. Even the toilets are candle lit and decorated with old books (for your reading pleasure). Now onto the food, the subject of much controversy. Yes, I agree most dishes are overpriced especially for a little hole in the wall on some unknown street. It is not exactly the city center but they are commanding city prices. Why? Because some of their food is really THAT GOOD. Mainly, the beef flank! It was heavenly! I bet many restaurants in the city could not even whip up beef half this good. It was truly amazing. Recently, I ate at Valentino's, at turf city, arguably one of the best steaks I've tasted in Singapore at a whopping price tag of $288! Good beef don't come cheap! Compared to the prices out there, Symmetry's beef flank is a steal (though not in quantity)!!! I was pleasantly surprised that a humble little cafe could whip up such a delectable dish! I'll definitely be back for more. Other than the beef flank, I heard that their Lamb shoulders ($49) \u00c2\u00a0was highly recommended but one of my dinner companions did not take lamb so we passed on this dish. If it's anything like the beef flank... I can't wait to come back to try it (although I am not a big fan of lamb). To the critics' merit, the other dishes paled in comparison to the beef flank. Despite the cod and chicken both being very fresh (and the chicken surprisingly more tender than it looked), the style of cooking and sauces that accompanied them were quite average. Kudos to the chef for trying to spice up the chicken dish with truffle sauce but the combo didn't hit it off with me. The chicken pan-fried was simply too blend for me and even though I love truffle sauce, it could not save the dish. The cod was average. Simple, Safe, Tried & tested. Nothing special. For desserts we had the milkshake and compressed baby carrots. The milkshake was rich and flavorful :) but at $9 a pop... I rather get mine from OnceAUponAMilkshake. A good attempt at trying to conjure up a new creation with carrots but unfortunately this dessert was disappointing. Served with a small scoop of what tasted like bread-pudding ice-cream and some crumbs of what we speculated were nuts, oatmeal, cookie crumbles and crust of carrot cake? \u00c2\u00a0This was indeed a weird concoction as if the chef raided the fridge for last night's left overs and toss it all together in a bowl. Last but not least... the carrots!!! They were served raw! it was so strange to munch on real, life-sized, baby carrots with ice-cream??? Not a good combination at all! Vegetables do not belong in my ice-cream :( Food Recap: 5 stars for the excellent beef flank & delightful ambiance - 2 stars for the mediocre other dishes. 1. Cod $32 - OK2. Corn fed chicken $28 - OK3. Beef flank $38 - LOVE4. Strawberry milkshake $9 - LOVE5. Compress Baby Carrots $15 - Pass! Overall, if you order the right dishes, don't mind spending $50+++\/pax on a cafe in an obscure location and enjoy a nice indie cafe this place can be a treasure for you.","928":"the service staff is amazing - Iqbal. \u00c2\u00a0he remembers my clique by name and our orders too! and the food is delicious - a tad expensive but worth every cent. coffee is alright.","929":"The good: \u00c2\u00a0Friend of a friend said they found this new place by chance and had a good drink, dinner and brunch experience. \u00c2\u00a0They had me at \"new\" (and drink to be honest) so I ventured down early on a Saturday morning to get me brunch fixing. \u00c2\u00a0Place was Bob Marley jammin' and I only managed to get a seat at the high-top-face-the-wall section. \u00c2\u00a0Ordered the latte, eggs benedict and watched the steady flow of patrons (mostly girls btw\/ftw) come in and out. \u00c2\u00a0The highlight for me was the occasional turning around to get a glimpse of place. \u00c2\u00a0But then it's back to my date, Miss Wall. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0The bad: \u00c2\u00a0When the eggs benedict came out I was excited. \u00c2\u00a0They took a few of the staples (english muffin, eggs) and added their own elements (cheese, caramelized unions, maple syrup bacon) to make what looked like an epic breakfast. \u00c2\u00a0Accompanied with the standard side of salad (meh) and a hefty hash brown (good). \u00c2\u00a0Carved me out a piece, popped it in my mouth, and just like the last episode of Seinfeld...it fell flat. \u00c2\u00a0I sat there for a good 10 minutes and tried to figure out why it was so bland. \u00c2\u00a0It definitely lacked seasoning, but all the other elements packed flavor individually. \u00c2\u00a0Then it hit me, the sweet bacon and onions clash with the savory cheese, and by right eggs benedict should be savory. \u00c2\u00a0The muffin and eggs are innocent bystanders as the fight for flavor takes place in your mouth. \u00c2\u00a0I want them to get along, but they don't, they can't, and everyone suffers. \u00c2\u00a0Of course the latte could be the saving grace for this meal, but it came out in a small glass so I couldn't take it seriously. \u00c2\u00a0 The ugly: \u00c2\u00a0Atmosphere is there, and I can tell the staff tries hard, but I suspect the cook lacks western cuisine experience or got way too excited when making the menu. \u00c2\u00a0High price points, I think I saw a croissant sandwich for 20 bucks. \u00c2\u00a0Unless you have a tiny french man back in the kitchen making that croissant, the price needs to be lower. \u00c2\u00a0Music selection was cool, but volumes fluctuated. \u00c2\u00a0I will however be back to try their drinks and dinner, but I'll be sure to book ahead to avoid another date with Miss Wall.","930":"they have a cool system where you put your name and number into an ipad outside, and they send you an automated call when your table is ready. seems a lot more efficient then a manual wait-list... other places should get on it stat. once you're inside, the place has a wonderful vibe. hispter art deco, random vintage furniture, raw wood, etc etc. music could have been a pitchfork top 100 countdown. unfortunately, it was pretty packed, so we were relegated to one of the side tables, with barely any space for our mains. livable, though. the menu was really cool, with nicely drawn art, but the prices, not so much. i just feel like charging ~$20 for brunch can be justified by location, portions or quality of food. since the place was sort of out of the way and we were told that these weren't \"sharing-portions\" we were really banking on the latter. sadly, our eggs benedict ($20) and eggs sur le plat ($22), while awesome in presentation, were not that good. the eggs benedict was merely ok, but the eggs sur le plat felt like watery tomato sauce with eggs and bits of chorizo. i would have been cool with it if it was like $7 less, but it really wasn't worth it. sad because i really wanted to like this place for all its other elements, but a pretty well-known brunch spot should really be judged on the quality of the food. the bright spot was the coffee, which was good. \u00c2\u00a0might come back in the future for coffee + dessert, but will skip the mains.","931":"Neo: I used to eat there; really good noodles.Knock, knock Neo...Wanton Seng's is *that* noodle place of your plugged-in dreams. If you have an affinity for ramen-style flavours and textures then Wantons should be right in your sweet spot.Located at the tail-end of Amoy St, this noodle house stands out by the sea of diners on its doorstep; and its iconic white on black retractable awning.For the hungry lunch-timer I'd recommend getting in early before it fills up and taking a space on the long bar bench in order to take in the interesting view of the kitchen activity.Dish of choice is the Combo - char siew & roasted pork belly, wontons, spring onions, fried shallots, 5 minute egg, & gangster baby kailan (scallops, braised shiitake, fried garlic). This comes with a bottom-less Miso Soup which you can self-serve top-up via the stainless steel soup pourer located in a station nearby to your seat (which also contains all your cutlery and napkin needs).I always leave here with a ramen-esque satisfied smile on my dial post noodle-athon.","932":"Pretty good \"high-end\" wan ton noodles here at Seng's Noodle Bar located along Amoy Street. As the name suggest, the star at this small eatery is none other than the humble wan ton noodles, where a decent plate will cost you at most $3 in any hawker center in Singapore. Here, they elevate the dish to another level - using good quality noodles, amazingly good bbq pork belly and other add-ons like 5 min-egg, roast pork, kailan (vege) and so forth. At first I thought this concept is lame and gimmicky but after 2 visits, I think Ah Seng did a good job and deserves a shoutout here on Yelp. A standard bowl of char siew wan ton noodles or roasted pork belly wan ton noodles will cost you $6.50, and if you're greedy like me, then get the \"two-some\" where you get the best of both accompaniment to your noodles ($7.50). Don't just stop here, add on the 5-min egg ($2) and extra fried wan tons (3 for $2) and you get a bowl of heaven at the price of $11. While the price might be expensive for a bowl of wan ton noodles, the portion's generous and guarantees a satisfactory lunch \/ dinner. Soup and other condiments (eg green chili, PORK LARD - OMFG!), and sauces are free flow, so just customize your own to your liking. I like my noodles black as squid ink, so ill usually drench thick soya sauce on my noodles before I stir everything and gobble it down. Service is prompt and friendly. Come early or slightly later after the peak lunch hour (12-1pm) to avoid having to queue to get in. Highly recommended if you're nearby this area.","933":"What?! No lard? They ran out of it the day before and did not make a new batch. Such disappointment. I had the Twosome - aburi char siew and sio bak with wantons. I think I will skip the meat next time as they are too thick and hard for my liking. What do I like about this atas wanton mee? The noodle, wantons and the soup! The noodle was springy, wantons were tasty with silky thin skin and the soup transported me to the days where wanton mee sellers in hawker centers or coffee shops take pride in their skills to make a darn good bowl of noodle. The soup has flavor, none of those salted water with a bare hint of taste. The lunch menu has changed and expanded. Now there is a mushroom and wanton noodle. I will want to try that next time. And I will add extra wantons to my noodle too. It is that good. The staff were friendly and knowing it was my first visit, they asked for feedback and explained what the various sauces were for. I mentioned the meat was a bit hard but otherwise the meal was yummy. They charge GST and a bottled water cost $2. They do not serve water here. Oh and do get in before 12pm otherwise you will find yourself waiting outside for a table. It gets crowded real quick after 12pm.","934":"Step above the hawker style wanton shops. This place has taste and attitude. Got the lunch combo with both char sieu and roast pork. \u00c2\u00a0Comes with a super garlicky Kailan greens and a so-so sousvided egg. \u00c2\u00a0Soup base, noodles and add-ons all top notch. \u00c2\u00a0Team have a bit more personality that typical SG food halls. Would be great for tourists or visiting work teams. Or can sit at bar solo as I did and will do again!Probably not for the price conscious or anti-hipster set. Eclectic music playing and cold beer on tap too. \u00c2\u00a0Nice modern black decor with artsy touches.","935":"The shop is located in the middle of a row of shophouses. The shop serves time-perfected wanton noodles, hailing from the famous Seng's Wanton Mee of Dunman Food Centre. The dine in area was quite small, with mostly counter seats surrounding the open concepted kitchen.Menu was just a single page for lunch. There was also cocktails available on the drink menu.ThreeSome \u00c2\u00a0- ThreeSome ThreeSome ($8.50)char Siew, roasted pork, wontons, braised shiitake mushrooms, spring onions, fried shallotsThe roast pork was light and crispy in texture. The Char Siew which looked like braised pork belly, was a bit dry. The mushroom was fat and juicy but tasted a bit too much of vinegar. I like that there was crispy pork lards in it. The wantons were average.Cosmoy ($16)infused Pandan vodka, cranberry juiceReminded me of an adult version of ribena.Don't forget to add condiments such as crispy pork lard and Seng's infamous chilli sauce to the noodles. Help yourself to the flask of hot soup on the counter.Overall the food was not bad. The place was packed, but the turnover was fast.","936":"[dinner]Came here for dinner in the opening week in June\/July 2015.The humble wanton noodle is given an upscale twist here, with DIY sauce mixing for your noodles and a plethora of wanton-mee-related items to eat with.We got the pork belly char siew, 5 minute eggs, shrimp dumplings, batalong egg, pork trotters, wantons, and the Chrysanthemum cocktails (shared between 3 people). I really enjoyed the batalong eggs, which is a local twist on a scotch egg; really yum!Everything else was okay, I'd come back again if I was in the area and didn't know what to eat. I have to say I am slightly swayed by the hipster vibe, and I love that I can customize the amount of hot sauce and pork lard bits in my noodles, but it's not amazing for me to crave it and come here specially.","937":"There was a year in distant youth where I ate nothing but wantan mee for lunch. \u00c2\u00a0I could easily do the same for WANTON@Sengs noodle bar. \u00c2\u00a0This place hits all the right spots. \u00c2\u00a0The noodles are perfectly done and taste really good - not the usual plasticky crap you get in most places.the black sauce and chilli hark back to best wantan noodles I ever had. \u00c2\u00a0The wantons really are perfect. \u00c2\u00a0The soup was a little fishy for my liking. \u00c2\u00a0The char siew deserves a paragraph all of its own. No overly red shavings of grey meat here. \u00c2\u00a0 Thick pieces, perfectly caramelised and scattered carelessly over the perfect noodles, they're the perfect accompaniment to one of the best bowls of wantan mee that I have had for a long time.","938":"Lot of style, little substance. Faux cool is still just faux. Under-seasoned meat, doughy wontons. Noodles had the right bite. Crisp pork lard and crackling.","939":"Great little noodle bar with a chill atmosphere. Pork belly perfectly marinated and ultimately flame charred in front of you makes a great companion to the wontons and noodles.","940":"Just went to get takeaway, and it wasn't great. First off it took really long to get our order out, we were there from about 1140, and only got our order at 12. Ordered the roast pork noodles but was pretty sad to have all my roast pork without crackling. :( Lastly when we asked about a friend's order that had not arrived 10 minutes after I received mine, the customer experience wasn't great. We were told to move outside, and just repeatedly told it'll be out when it's ready.","941":"The Wall is totally surreplicious!When you walk in, you'll be greeted warmly by the attentive female staff, presented with the menu and your first of many glasses of water (they will top you up whenever you are close to bottom).The Wall is an impressive collection of whiskies from around the world, but the two country's squarely in the sniper's sight are Scotland and Japan. With glasses ranging from $16 to $130+ there is something for everyone from the beginner to the connoisseur. There is also a selection of Scotch Malt Whisky Society bottles to choose from - these are already carefully re-wrapped post-pour to ensure they remain at their peak.If you know your whisky you'll have no trouble doing a solo army-of-one assault on the wall; whilst if you are new to the game you can let the well-armed staff supply the ammo for your tour of duty!Beware of the bottomless snacks - these are absolutely more-ish and you could polish off a dozen bowls before you even realise it.If you are interested in some history there is a window-view into some vintage relics of a bygone era at the bottom of the stairwell, which takes you to the second floor for privacy and some more historic memorabilia.If you're trying to impress a date or business colleagues, ask for Gwen and let her know your price range, and she will ensure the experience is set to awesome!","942":"I have to be straight with you.... I am reviewing the Ramen Nagi restaurant in the ION Shopping Center but i did not find it on Yelp. \u00c2\u00a0I paid a visit to the restaurant on a Friday for lunch and was surprised that there was no wait. \u00c2\u00a0Compared to the one in Santa Clara California which always had a line of about 15 people in it from opening to closing. \u00c2\u00a0It was definitely a nice change. I tried the baseline tonkutsu based version picking the same options as I do in California so that I can get a good comparison. \u00c2\u00a0The food arrived at about the same wait time and I was impressed with the similarities with the one in California. \u00c2\u00a0I was definitely impressed and will definitely come back again.","943":"I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't all that. We were staying at the Conrad across the street and saw that this ramen place was the highest rated in the area so of course, we had to try it. We went for an early dinner at around 5pm to beat the crowd. There were only a few tables full so there wasn't any problem getting a table. I really like that you get to customize your order by checking the boxes on their order sheet. This is definitely more efficient and eliminates the \"I never ordered that\" issue. Also, you can customize the broth flavor, noodle firmness, spicy, toppings and much more. Service was quick and I was really excited to try my customized bowl of squid ink ramen. Unfortunately, it was just OK. The noodles were thinner than I would like and the broth was underwhelming. I'm glad that I was able to try this place but will probably not go back.","944":"Just right. That's what I think of when I've finished this bowl of ramen. Ramen Nagi is an award winning ramen in Japan and they've pretty much expanded all over Asia, yet this is their first Singapore location. The reputation is legit as it was bustling on a Friday night and slightly difficult to get a table, even for this party of one. I wanted to try this place out after seeing so many positive reviews that it received on Google Reviews and other Singapore food recommendation blogs.This ramen place hits the spot. It had everything that you would ever want from a traditional Tonkotsu bowl. The Butao King Tonkatsu broth was flavorful, rich, and creamy with a slight briney hint to it. I customized my bowl by making it slightly richer than normal, more al dente of a bite to the noodles, and even adding in an egg and seaweed for good measure. Definitely get the tender pork belly as well. It's been braised in a sweet braising sauce and the results just complements the broth really well.The bill came out to about $18 SGD ($15 USD) and you pay on the way out so you don't need to ask for the check to come to the table. Overall, I would definitely be back to try their other versions of the King.","945":"I've had Ramen Nagi in California many times before, but this was my first trying the one in Singapore. Overall, this is some of the best ramen I've had outside of Japan and I will definitely be back for more!Food:There are 4 main broths that they have here: Butao King (standard tonkotsu), Red King (spicy tonkotsu), Black King (squid ink tonkotsu), and Green King (basil tonkotsu). When I went they also had 2 specials: Spicy Garlic Miso King and Sausage King. I tried the Spicy Garlic ramen and I found it to be delicious! The broth was very flavourful, rich, and garlicky. I also really enjoyed the shredded onions and small slices of pork that they added in. Unfortunately, you can't adjust the usual options for the limited specials (e.g. richness, oil, spiciness, etc.), but I thought it tasted fantastic the way they served it.Service\/Wait:I came here on a Saturday at 6:30pm and didn't have to wait at all for a table. The restaurant is quite large and was half empty when I arrived. It was pretty full by the time I left around 7:15pm, though. The service was attentive, though they don't serve water.Price: $$Pretty reasonable as far as ramen goes. The 4 standards bowls range from $14 to $17, though the special ones are around $20. It also costs an additional $20 for a flavoured egg, although I found the egg to be delicious and well worth it.","946":"Tried the Butao King ramen with choice of pork belly. The tonkotsu broth was velvety, well balanced, not too salty. Pork belly melt in the mouth tender but with 70:30 fat\/meat ratio and yet was still very, very good (just below the level of that unforgettable melt in your mouth pork tenderness found in Kikanbo in Tokyo).I made the mistake of circling 4 for the home made fire sauce. The sauce brought heat but also sweetness (more than i cared for which sort of ruined the dish for me). The spicy sweet sauce with cayenne pepper powder is somewhat similar to the chili paste you put on top of lontong but sweeter. I think level 1 or 2 would have made this more balanced.The firmness level of the Hakata type thin noodles at normal is more like soft which made me wished i had selected 'hard'.The condiments containers for bean sprouts and mustards were almost depleted and should have had been replenished hours ago.Deducting a star for the somewhat anemic customer service and for not providing complimentary water or green tea in a restaurant that serves unlimited fiery level food.","947":"This place was amazing!! I was kind of unsure how to order so I went for the basic but did an increase on the flavor.... best decision ever! This was the beat ramen I've had! Mind you, I haven't had that many authentic ramens either. What made it even more interesting was that I had just watched a special about Ramen on Netflix. Everything they said to look for in ramen taste and smell, this place had. The seating was kind on interesting. They had no issue with pairing you up with another person who was also a solo dinner. When a place was empty, it seemed like a pit crew came and cleaned the spot quickly. The other interesting, highly entertaining thing they did was greet whoever walked through the door in unison! I had such a great time dining here that I hated I came on my last night. Will definitely be coming back on my next visit!","948":"The famous Ramen Nagi chain finally arrives in Singapore. Originally a hole-in-the-wall place in Fukuoka, they have since expanded to more than 20 shops in Japan and their chef won the Ramen of the Year championship.The Singapore menu is only limited to the tonkotsu pork-broth ramen that comes in original, black (squid ink), red (spicy) and green (basil-olive oil) versions. The broth is extremely rich and flavorful, though it leaned a little on the sweet side. This might appeal or be a turn-off depending on your preference.The noodles are firm and springy, the chashu tender, and the eggs perfectly done (thought you have to pay extra for it). Not sure why there's reviews knocking the place, I think it's pretty decent ramen by Singapore standards. Obviously nothing beats eating it at a hole-in-the-wall joint in Japan, but then there's the 8 hour flight to contend with.","949":"The restaurant was part of a chain originated from Japan, with outlets in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Philippines. Fisherman King (S$16.90++)which was this month's limited king and limited to 400 bowls.Featuring sardine oil infused with Nagi's award-winning tonkotsu pork-broth, topped with succulent chashu slices, bonito powder and a fragrant ball of minced pork.Selected normal for soup base and special sauce. The soup was rich and flavourful without too salty.Selected kakuni (pork belly) which came in 2 thick slices. Tender but still not quite melt in the mouth. Another choice would be chashu (pork shoulder).The ball of minced meat was kind of too salty.Selected chopped spring onions for vegetables. Another choice would be cabbage.Selected spicy level 1. Not quite taken with the spicy sauce.Topup S$2++ for Tamago but the staff forgot and did not serve it in the ramen. Therefore had to explain to cashier that I did not have the egg when he wanted bill me for it.Gyoza (S$7.90++)Meat and vegetables seasoned with Japanese spices, wrapped in nagi's special dough and finished with a crispy lattice skirt.It looked quite pretty with the thin crispy crust, but there's barely any filling in each dumpling. Served with a soyu vinegar dip.There's no free flow of iced water here. The cheapest drink on the menu was Mujicha (S$1++) which was bottomless but I never saw the staff going around refilling.Although Suntec City had free wifi, but one could not receive the mall's wifi in the restaurant.Condiments such as marinated bean sprouts, marinated mustards, grounded sesame seeds, chilli powder, oil and tissue were available on the table.Bag box was available under the stool.","950":"Spizza is a really great place and i honestly don't understand why people wouldn't like this place. They provide both indoor and outdoor seating, take reservations and carry out deliveries. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor isn't bad, even though the building is old and it's pretty clean too. The only reason it's at a 4 star is because the desert menu didn't have much variety. However, the main course, Pizza's and Appetisers definetly made up for it. The waiters were friendly and did their jobs well, the Pizza's were great and the Burratina was awesome and so was the Calamari. I highly recommend you try the 'Isabella'. Its truly a masterpiece. The Ravioli was pretty good too. Definitely a great place for a Pizza lover and an even better place for families. If you love Pizza, you'll definitely love this place.","951":"Unfortunately, I have different opinions from other yelpers. Hidden along the streets of Bukit Timah is this place called Spizza. You will see it on the roads if you happen to travel along Bukit Timah and if you pass by a building called Balmoral Plaza.When I first saw this, I was like \"meh\", another pizza store. But I was so wrong. One of my ex-tutor actually recommended this place to me and my mother tried it first. She said it was \"alright\" but I decided to give it a try since I come by Balmoral Plaza regularly - mom's work place.Spizza opens at 12pm on weekdays. So every time my mother and I come by here, it would always be empty and we will be the first to be greeted then seated customers. The waiters are always friendly and approachable. They always carry smiles with them when we walk in to the store till we walk out of the store. This makes me come back to this Spizza chain regularly - excellent customer service.What I like to get from this chain? There are some regular dishes that I enjoy and will not go without upon entering this place.First of all, Aglio Olio. The noodles were cooked in perfection and the ingredients were just right making it not soggy. With or without prawns (shellfish allergens like myself) is the same pricing. I like the taste as it is not too strong in terms of the olive oil used.Second dish, Quinta Pizza. It is thin crusted pizza with tomato base, shredded and baked mozzarella, runny egg (egg white and egg yolk) in the middle of the pizza and black truffle paste spread out nicely on the pizza itself. Why I specifically order this pizza? I love the crunchy thin crust texture of the pizza as it is crispy. It also has stronger truffle taste which will linger in your tongue for awhile after consuming it. The pizza comes in 8 slices for the medium sized and sometimes I tend to eat at least half of the portion together with the Aglio Olio. Tara (Tomato, Mozzarella, Egg, Bacon, Button Mushrooms) has egg in the center also but I still love Quinta more.Dessert, Tiramisu is one of the best (that's what I always order if I have empty stomach left for dessert cravings). Will try CIOCCOLATA and ORANGE CR\u00c3\u0088ME BR\u00c3\u009bL\u00c3\u0089E in the near future.Drinks, I tend to order coolers (Spizza Signature Cooler - Passionfruit and Peach 'Bellina'). The combination of fizzy drinks are considered smart move. Ambience wise for this restaurant was pretty classy, simple yet modern. It is definitely a good place to hang out during tea time. Will definitely be back for more rounds of delicious foods. Bon Appetit!Update: tried the Orange creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e but wasn't a wow factor for me :(","952":"Dropped by for lunch with girlfriends and tried their gluten-free penne pasta with tomato and Mediterranean vegetables from their lunch special menu for just S$12. It was absolutely delicious. Would love to see more gluten free items on the menu, but at least they have GF penne which can be combined with any of their \"classic\" sauces including tomato, aglio olio, etc.","953":"Nice family place that is away from the hustle bustle of a mall. A good option after a movie as last order is 1015pm. Good crispy pizzas, flavourful pastas.. The ongoing UOB 1-on-1 for mains is a pretty good deal too. Its on entertainer app too.","954":"Pizza was average but they had a good selection.They have outdoor and indoor seating. I sat outside but it is near Bukit Timah so very noisy.The service however is friendly but slow and unorganised. Asked for bill 4 times before getting it.. Didn't get my drink order till after pizza was finished.Good idea, ok good but poorly executed. No need to go back.","955":"This Spizza and I have a nice little thing going. Every Wednesday night after my meeting down the road, I head over to Spizza where they have my corner table waiting for me and my laptop. I order, hop online and start to work and the pizza is ready in no time. Plus, they bring me extra napkins so degrease my fingers as I eat and type (the American in me just won't eat pizza with a fork and knife unless I'm in polite company and my laptop just doesn't count).Spizza's pizzas are solid: good crust, generally fresh sauce and decent ingredients. I am partial to the Isabella (parma ham, tomato, mozzarella and rucola salad) but I also haven't tried everything on the menu just yet. The Margherita pizza is not up to par: they claimed to use buffla mozzarella and fresh basil, but the pizza I got just had the cheap stuff and no basil. But if you stay away from that, your overall experience should be good.","956":"Attention guests: the oven is NOT wood-fired contrary to what is advertised. However, the thin-crust pizzas are very good. Family\/quiet place.","957":"Spizza is a decent place serving thin crust pizzas - great for dining there when you're not feeling particularly hungry. Prices are decent, with 1 pizza usually being good for 2 to share. The outlet at Bukit Timah is located in a relatively low key shopping mall, and is great for family dining. The reason why this branch of Spizza only gets 2 stars is because it's not hard to find better quality pizzas in Bukit Timah - Peperoni and Casa Verde spring to mind, with both being relatively comparable in prices to Spizza. It's decent, but don't expect mind-blowing orgasmic food.","958":"The food tastes amazing! And great value for money. Good service and ambience.Good options for vegetarians as well.","959":"The Bustling Little Italian BistroDiscovered a little gem today along Craig Rd. In fact, we discovered it via the back entrance facing Duxton Park. Located along the shop houses and a couple of doors away from the Antique store is Pastaria Abate, a cozy casual Bistro serving freshly made pastas and other Italian dishes. The concept is simple. Pick a pasta, pick a sauce and wait for your number to be called. What's good about Pastaria Abate is that they'll be more than happy to let you know if the combination doesn't work or which sauce pairs with which pasta the best. Prices here are pretty decent too, with pastas ranging from $8.80 to $15.80 and mains starting at $12.80.Bruschetta ($6.80)One of my favourite appetizers and always a perfect way to whet the pallet.The tomatoes were sweet and juicy and the bread, though thick, was soft and fluffy. I did feel that it lacked a bit of depth and the amount of vinaigrette used was a bit of an overkill, \u00c2\u00a0but on a whole, it was still a decent bruschetta.Fried Mozzarella ($6.80)Without a doubt, the BEST fried Mozzarella we've ever had. The breading was thin and fried to perfection, giving a little crunch as you cut in to unveil the very rich and decadent cheese. The biggest surprise was how the strawberry sauce it came with complimented the fried mozzarella so well, giving off a slight sweet yet tartness to balance out the richness of the cheese. Truffle Carbonara ($15.90)The Carbonara here is pretty decent. No cream (yes! A true Carbonara) and using Pancetta. The pasta was al dante and the Pancetta gave a good salty punch. The truffle though...... didn't really add much to the dish. I'd suggest going for the normal $12.90 instead. Porcini and Truffle Ravioli ($16.90...I think)Another special of the day, the Procini and Truffle Ravioli was really good.The earthiness of the filling mixed with that light but wholesome butter sauce was delightful. Simplicity at its best. Definitely one of the better ravioli's I've had (without paying an exorbitant price) \u00c2\u00a0Overall the food here is pretty good, so if you're looking for somewhere casual, with pretty good pasta (and a good variety of pasta) and not a fan of Pastamania (can that even be considered a pasta restaurant?), than head on down to Pastaria Abate to give it a try!Remarks: I've been there after being diagnosed with Kidney Issues and I'm proud to say that they are happy to prepare the food salt free.","960":"Fantastic simple Italian restaurant. Staff are very knowledgeable and advise on what works well together. Great value too.","961":"Really good placeMy friend and I had baked eggs, egg Benedict and matcha latte.Matcha latte reminds me of the taste I had in Japan and the eggs are awesome.","962":"Came back for dinner. One can easily overlook this place, hidden by queues for the two Song Fah bak kut teh outlets, and located on the less busy side of New Bridge\/Eu Tong Sen. (Except for the sad-looking panini's), the food rocks! The chef, who may be more talented as a chef than as a business manager, would do well at a premium restaurant!","963":"Simple but elegant d\u00c3\u00a9cor, with soothing bossa nova-style music. The place's identity is a bit confusing. Is it a coffee shop or an eatery? Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but at lunch only pasta, paninis and salads are available. Mains (a limited list) are served from 3 pm - for what kind of client\u00c3\u00a8le?","964":"Good place to have food and cakes and coffee, tea and drinks. The cake taste delicious, drinks is good too.Price however not cheap.","965":"This is my first time visit and eat at Wanna Cuppa! I would love come back here again.","966":"Haven't posted a review in a very long time but when you find a gem, something moves you to leave a remark.Looked this place up on Yelp on my way to a Japanese restaurant and my stomach changed its mind.Nice clean decor and jazz tunes created a great ambiance.I thought breakfast food would be served all day but that was not the case. \u00c2\u00a0But I was not disappointed with their dinner.Soft shell crab pasta caught my attention and it surprisingly delivered. \u00c2\u00a0Pasta was light, crab was nicely seasoned and cooked with the perfect crunch and with every bite, the deep flavor permeated my mouth. \u00c2\u00a0The glass of Chardonnay would have complemented well but the wine was not chilled unfortunately.I also ordered ice hazelnut latte and the lava cake and my dinner was near perfect.5 stars!","967":"New kid in the block ! Wanna Cuppa opened only sometime in Nov\/Dec 2015, conveniently situated right opposite Clarke Quay station. I was there on a Sunday afternoon and it was pleasantly quiet. The ambiance is relaxing and there's ample seats. Flat white was not bad. The enoki fries was a tad oily.Didn't try anything else on the menu. They had quite a selection of cakes on display too but I was too full for anything.I'd go back if I happen to be around the area.","968":"I don't agree with the other reviewers so 1 star to make the reviews here on Yelp seem legit. I went a few months ago, and I thought the service was not amazing, and food was horrible. In my opinion.My friend ordered salad with chicken and she said the chicken was way too dry and forced herself to eat the salad. I had a pasta with meat and tomato sauce and I just couldn't eat any of it. It felt to me like they just microwaved meat and hence the tough meat, and pasta was not fresh it was just not up to the standard that I was expecting. I also ordered a coffee but nothing beat ronin or punch in that neighborhood in my opinion. Therefore I haven't gone back ever since.I'm writing this review because I am looking for other cafes and restaurants nearby this neighborhood since I just moved here. But to see this place on top of Ronin made me think the reviews are not legitimate, especially with only 3 other reviews. So let's be real. It may be good enough for locals, but as an Asian who was born and raised abroad, I personally don't like it, but give it one try, as I did, and decide for yourself.","969":"Love the interior. The name cuppa has actually captured my attention to step it for a quick coffee! It's not easy to find a place with good coffee with pretty and lasting coffee art made with skills here. Will definitely be back here again!","970":"I love this place. It's at the Paragon shopping mall at Orchard. We had a long black coffee and a iced cappuccino. Free fresh water here, it came in a small carafe. Good ambiance and good service too.","971":"It's not often that I review buffets, but after partaking at Opus, I'm compelled to do so. They say competition breeds excellence, and that's certainly true here. Most of the resort properties in Singapore compete for dominance in the ultra luxury buffet space and the results are spectacular. Since most buffets are offering the same basic stuff as far as food, we decided to choose based on brand of free-flow champagne. You read right, free-flow champagne! They offer one of my personal favorites Taittinger Brut from France. Everything just fell into place after that. Limitless lobster tails, king crab, prawns, and fresh shucked oysters highlight the seafood. Full sushi bar. Fresh sliced prosciutto. Artisan cheese bar. Prime rib, ham, and charcuterie. And a first for me--a foie gras station. Incredible. Beyond the food and drink, Opus excels with comfortable surroundings, and top notch service. The staff are incredible and attentive. Our champagne flutes were NEVER empty and our plates were always cleared. Manager and executive chef comes to every table to follow up with guests and ask where they can improve. Expect to pay for all this decadence to the tune of $167 SD or $120 USD. I don't care. It was so worth it. My advice is to book and early seating around 12:30 and pace yourself. They started running out of shellfish shortly after 2pm.","972":"My family stayed at the Hilton on Orchard Road for our vacation in Singapore. Our package included breakfast every morning at the Opus Bar and Grill. My sister and I had mad jet lag so we woke up early and headed downstairs for the breakfast buffet. There were only a couple people up and eating at 6:00 am, so we had the restaurant pretty much all to ourselves.I thought the buffet was very comprehensive with both western and eastern style food. There was also an omelette bar with egg whites only option available. My favorite was the bircher muesli with a mixture of rolled oats, raisin, nuts, fruits, and milk. It went well with the strong latte I ordered. The mini pain au chocolat or chocolate croissant was super delicious as well; perfect in size, buttery, chocolaty, and flaky. Overall, I thought it was smart for us to start breakfast early because it got super busy later on.","973":"My boyfriend wanted to have a 4 legged meat for dinner so we opted for Opus. It is conveniently located on Orchard Road, inside the Hilton Hotel. When you walk in stay to your right past the reception and head for the back of the hotel. There you will find the restaurant.We didn't have a reservation and showed up around 20h30 and were seated right away. I think we got really lucky...When you walk in, along the back wall, you can see the kitchen although it is closed off from the main dining room.We started with a cocktail. A Macallan 12 for him and Lychee Martini for me, which was delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness and served with two lychees on top.Oh... And they had a promotion going. Order a steak and you get free wine with dinner. Can't beat it!So before our food gets there, they present us with this huge loaf of cheese bread. His eyes rolled in the back of his head when he tasted it, so I can only assume it was delish...He had the Tomato Burrata as a starter which was served with a heaping pile of Arugula. It was very fresh.I started with the Mushroom Velout\u00c3\u00a9. It is served with a drizzle of Truffle Oil on top and a slice of Bread with Grilled Parmesan and Emmental cheese on top. The soup itself was not heavy and had a very good mushroom flavor. It was smooth without being overly creamy. And the Truffle Oil was just enough for a hint of the taste without being overwhelming like most places serve it. I thoroughly enjoyed it.He followed with a Filet Mignon with Peppercorn sauce and fries.I had the Wild Sea Bass. It is cooked to perfection! The skin side is crispy and delicious. It comes in a broth with clams, Black mussels, artichoke, vine tomatoes and thyme. If you are looking for a light, yet satisfying meal, I highly recommend it. I couldn't get enough of the fish! In addition, I had a side helping of the Grilled Asparagus. Lovely!","974":"The traffic is bad and hotels are expensive due to F1 this weekend. So I didn't want to go anywhere and tried Opus in lobby. People who enjoys drinking will love their promotion and citi bank Credit card users could order one more dish as the discount is good.I ordered scallop and sea bass. Scallop was fine but the sea bass was not tender enough. Sea bass can be tender, can't it?Better to have dinner here than to order in room service.","975":"Come for the steak, stay for the promo!Sunday to Thursday if you buy a steak you get 2 hours free flow (Prosecco & Wine). The good Wife and I probably hit this joint once a month. We'll typically share the 800g Australian ribeye, smash a few sides (the garlic mash is seriously good!) then do our best to put the Hilton out of business on free flow. Yes the steaks are great, ambiance is a little boring, staff are lovely. We like it for a casual date night. Give it a go.","976":"The restaurant was one of the many restaurants which offered restaurant week menu during the one week long Singapore Restaurant Week. As I was early for my reservation for lunch which cost $40++ for a 3-course set meal, I was asked to take a seat at the bar area before showing to my table in the restaurant. Interestingly the restaurant was also offering buffet during lunch time. There was a huge noisy group sitting behind me who were having the buffet option.I was served onion cheese loaf with butter on a wooden chopping board. I would preferred the bread to be served hot. The bread was soft, filled with bits of soft, brown onion bits.Tartar of Bluefin Tuna (ala carte $17++)avocado, chives, trout roe, extra virgin olive oilThe raw fish was well marinated and flavourful, with the sea salt enhancing the taste.Wild Sea Bass (ala carte $36++)clams, black mussels, artichokes, vine tomatoes and thymeThe serving was much bigger than expected. The fish was chunky and firm. The stock which served was light and flavourful.Grilled Honey Pineapple (ala carte $12++)vanilla ice-cream, crumbles and rum sauceThe dehydrated pineapple was crunchy and full of the fruit flavours. The rum sauce was rich but was easily overpowered by the vanilla ice cream. The crumbles added texture to the simple looking dessert.Overall food was great. Service was great too with water refilled regularly and the service staffs checking on me regularly. One even asked if I needed some magazines. Bill was presented on top of a wooden box.","977":"Sunday Champagne Brunch is no new concept but it's all about providing that quality experience to the diners. While Hilton Singapore may not have the most extensive spread, they make up for it in terms of the cosy ambience and quality selections in some of their a la minute sections. Highlights of the new buffet spread include live seafood, meat carving and grill stocked with fresh imported ocean catches, premium Australian cuts and gourmet delicatessen from Europe.I typically start with the cured meats and cheeses and i was very happy at the Smorgasbord Station, which featured thinly-sliced \u00c3\u00a0 la minute charcuterie of imported whole leg Iberico ham, Lomo Ham and Saucisson sec cured meat.I went absolutely crazy with the bleu cheeses! There are more than 20 types of cheeses specially flown in from Italy, France and Switzerland. Best bleu spread ever.At the live Seafood Station, you get to taste sashimi and half shell scallops from Australia, Canadian-Maine Lobsters, yabbies (a type of crayfish) from Spain and shucked oysters from Australia, Canada and France. I skipped this section as they didn't smell too appealing. I thought the hot food fared better. With eight cooking stations, there is plenty to pick from. A la minute specialty dishes such as pan-fried foie gras with apple and passion fruit (really enjoyed the tartness but the foie gras was overcooked), fresh homemade Italian maccheroni pasta with juicy Maine lobster meat and yabbies...And HELLO homemade Scotch egg with black truffle hollandaise! Even though some of my dining partners felt that the sausage crust was a tad salty, i thought it was perfect with the yolk (it's overcooked and they certainly could do better than that). The amount of sodium is perfectly acceptable if you think of it as a sausage #YOLO.Hearty, meaty offerings include Australian grain-fed prime rib, honey mustard-glazed pork rack and slow-grilled herb-roasted baby fowl. I enjoyed the meats from the open-flame charcoal grills. Cuts of wagyu flank steaks, lamb chops and Rangers Valley grain-fed beef tenderloins are sizzled over white-hot charcoal. Do not go expecting medium rare meats though, they all turn fairly medium-medium done. Don't skip the delicious sides of vegetables like roasted tomatoes on the vine, caramelized pumpkin, and asparagus gratin! I believe the Asian Station could be skipped. Oh but don't miss the liu sha bao! I was surprised at how good it was. That was truly a hidden gem in the dim sum corner. Dessert is a highlight at Hilton Singapore. With over 30 sweet treats like the luscious caramel hazelnut chocolate fountain -tears of joy-, cakes, mousse, tarts, pralines and macarons... it's pure heaven for the sheer amount of variety. The Hilton Singapore Sunday Champagne Brunch is available every Sunday from noon to 3pm, only at Opus Restaurant, located on the ground level.","978":"On a hot day in Singapore, I decided to venture out into the world, barely avoiding heat stroke. To be honest, I wasn't that hungry but I didn't want to let a minute go to waste since I don't make it to SG that often. I was staying in Chinatown and had arrived earlier that day, so I figured I would eat close to my hotel in case the sun became too much.Chinatown is full of shops and dumplings. Unfortunately, it is also full of tourists.I did my best to avoid tourists and found a small dumpling shop hidden behind a construction zone. I figure the construction zone is not usual because the the shop, Jing Hua Xiao Chi, had been featured multiple times on various \"Best Dumplings\" lists. Okay, so it wasn't the hidden gem I was hoping for but it was definitely not riddled with tourists and that was good enough for me!The walls were red and tastefully (pun intended) decorated with photos of dumplings. Overall the shop was small and fairly empty. I didn't spot a single tourist out of the three groups that were in the restaurant. The staff was nice and sat me quickly and a menu and ordering pad were waiting for me at the table.I was running short on cash and Jing Hua didn't take cards (for the amount I spent.) Fortunately, the dumplings weren't too expensive. After entering the shop, I immediately looked at the menu to see what drinks they had. I needed something refreshing after a short walk that seemed to take an eternity. I noticed they had a Mango Juice on the menu for $3 ($2.20 USD) and I went for it. It was more than I would prefer to spend on a drink but this kind of stuff goes for $10 in California, plus I was desperate.I wanted to check every box on the menu but remembered the minimal cash I had in my wallet and decided to go with the classic Xiao Long Bao for $8 ($5.88 USD) an honest steal compared to SF prices. I've had many a Xiao Long Bao and part of me wanted to try one of the pan fried dumplings, but alas, I decided to play it safe and go with a fan favorite.The Mango Juice was just what I needed. It was refreshing and slightly thick. If it wasn't made of real mango it certainly had me fooled. There was an odd touch of rose water but it grew on me and I downed the whole thing pretty much before the dumplings came. I don't even like mango, but I liked this.Not long after the Mango Juice arrived, a plate of steaming-hot dumplings was placed right in front of me. I was so excited but slightly nervous because I didn't want to be disappointed by this apparently-famous dumpling house. The classic soy\/vinegar dumpling sauce was already on the table so I poured myself a saucer-full and placed a single dumpling into the saucer to soak and cool a bit.What happened next was incredible. The dumpling was still hot but I couldn't wait any longer. I put it in my mouth and felt the soup flow in my mouth as I chewed. It was a mix of soy, vinegar, pork juices and sesame. I think the sesame part was pretty unique but maybe that's just how they do it in Singapore. Whatever the reason, I am happy they discovered this combination of flavors because it was a true delight and I would definitely go back.I wolfed down the seven dumplings, walked up to the front of the shop and paid. In case it wasn't clear, I was one happy customer.If you spend enough money, they take Visa. Pay at the front.Total Cost: $13.30 ($9.77 USD)21 Neil RdSingaporeThis post is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews","979":"I had the steamed pork dumplings and zha jing noodles. Dumplings were fine, but the noodles where uninspiring and looked and tasted like someone justed scoop something out of a pot that has been sitting all day on \u00c2\u00a0a pile of noodles.","980":"Meh. Was better back when it was Qun Zhong. Dumpling skins could have been frozen. Service was so so. Better at hawker stands right up street.","981":"Eh. So mediocre omg. Nothing authentic of this place. What a disappointment. Noodles were like the frozen kind? I don't know. Spinach dish is very boring. Vegetarian dumpling was ok. Xiao long bao is not good not authentic and a bit pricy for what it is at 8sgd for 7 pieces.","982":"I can't believe I just recently discovered Jing Hua restaurant. I never walk along this side of Neil Road but one Sunday in search of food or anything even open worth trying around this area, I stumbled upon Jing Hua. It was open, air conditioned, and there wasn't a crowd so I thought I'd give it a try.I was surprised at the number of Yelp reviews mostly raving about Jing Hua. I cracked up as I read through a number of the reviews while ordering and eating my meal. I especially cracked up at Ida's review as there was a twist to the ending where she ordered all that food for herself! I did the same and didn't feel bad about it after seeing her review, haha.The xiao long bao are very good. On par with DTF I'd say. I really enjoyed my hot and sour noodle soup. It's just like regular hot and sour soup but with a nice thick udon-y noodle to help balance out soup with some carbs.The lotus pancake was awesome also. Not the healthiest as it's deep fried but the skin was crispy to perfection and the lotus inside was subtly sweet and added a good gooey texture to go with the crispy skin. I took half home for breakfast the next morning and although not as good fresh, it was still semi-crispy and enjoyable.I'll be back Jing Hua!","983":"Jing Hua is a RIPOFF! You've been warned! With that said, those dumplings are damn good. I suppose it's bc the fillings are oh-so juicy, oh-so porky, and oh-so veg-gy. They don't skimp on the fillings, hence, the hefty price tag. The zhajiang mian (black bean noodle sauce) is nothing to rave about...it's a bit bland, actually. The veggies are also very simple: stir-fried in garlic but $8 for a small portion. Come here if you're really, REALLY craving old-style, mama homemade kind of dumplings. Otherwise, I think the dumpling places found in Maxwell or Chinatown would suffice. For half the price tag. Don't forget, this place is cash only. Boo. Last time I went, we had to dig into our pockets and return the wet napkins ($0.80 a pop) bc we didn't have enough cash. We paid more than $50 for two pax...was that worth the AC and juicy, pork, veg-gy dumplings? Maybe....","984":"This is a review of lunch with a friend at Jing Hua Restaurant at the Qun Zhong Eating House.tinyurl.com\/m9ec4qpMy friend suggested this restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0 With the exception of the hot & sour soup, my friend selected our dishes.Note: \u00c2\u00a0Sometimes I feel unburdened in writing reviews when I do not know a specific cuisine extremely well. \u00c2\u00a0I can simply review whether I enjoy the food or not. \u00c2\u00a0I do not have to get caught up in authenticity or if there is some restaurant down the street that some might think is better. \u00c2\u00a0It is the case for this review.Jing Hua Restaurant at the Qun Zhong Eating House is all about the food. \u00c2\u00a0 The service is effective. \u00c2\u00a0It is efficient. \u00c2\u00a0Don't expect them to be coming over and high-fiving you and asking if everything is to your liking. \u00c2\u00a0They are going to take your order sheet. \u00c2\u00a0They are going to verify your order. \u00c2\u00a0They are going to bring you your food. \u00c2\u00a0They are going to do all of this relatively quick. \u00c2\u00a0Then they are going to want you to leave so they can do the same for the next hungry guests.There are the usual checklist sheets for ordering. \u00c2\u00a0There are also helpful reference photo menus. \u00c2\u00a0Compared to some similar restaurants, the menu is not extensive. \u00c2\u00a0But I think this allows them to focus on the quality of the dishes they do serve.tinyurl.com\/kzzyvk4tinyurl.com\/mp5ldyptinyurl.com\/lv2gvvcThe ambiance is very clean and functional. \u00c2\u00a0There is red trim to provide some colour. \u00c2\u00a0The tables are basic (mostly round) red topped tables. \u00c2\u00a0The chairs are those simple and painful folding chairs that get pulled out for school assemblies and such. \u00c2\u00a0There is a front room and a back room. \u00c2\u00a0For our visit (at 1:30 pm on a Friday), the place was initially packed. \u00c2\u00a0 By the time we were leaving, it was emptying out. \u00c2\u00a0But their lunch service ends at 3 pm. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0It had the bustle of a restaurant where everyone was enjoying their food. \u00c2\u00a0If your group isn't large enough to fill a table, they do communal seating.tinyurl.com\/n3ujahatinyurl.com\/m7cwmc5The food was all very good to excellent. \u00c2\u00a0It was freshly prepared. \u00c2\u00a0The dishes were also well presented.Lunch Collage Photo:tinyurl.com\/om9trxyMinced Pork Noodles - This was a fantastic dish. \u00c2\u00a0It was comfort in a bowl. \u00c2\u00a0For my personal taste, the noodles were perfect. \u00c2\u00a0The flavours were wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0I ate every bite including the greens.tinyurl.com\/mg6mx2cPan Fried Pork Dumplings - This was another excellent dish. \u00c2\u00a0They had just the right amount of crispiness. \u00c2\u00a0They were not oily. \u00c2\u00a0The taste just made me want to eat more and more.tinyurl.com\/kdj8n4pHot and Sour Soup - I almost decided to lick the bowl. \u00c2\u00a0I was certainly trying to get every last drop out of it. \u00c2\u00a0I would not have minded for it to of had a little bit more spicy heat to it. \u00c2\u00a0Unlike some of the other courses, this is a dish, I have eaten a lot of other versions. \u00c2\u00a0This certainly ranked with some of the better hot and sour soups I've tried. \u00c2\u00a0It was also another very comforting dish. \u00c2\u00a0It would be perfect for a flu day or if it ever snowed in Singapore.tinyurl.com\/o5xjtjgLittle Juicy Steamed Meat Dumplings - Just another winner - As soup dumplings go, these were very good. \u00c2\u00a0I just love the explosion of flavour that they provide. \u00c2\u00a0The dumpling itself was well prepared. \u00c2\u00a0Just thin enough to be light and just thick enough to hold together for the sometimes challenging journey to one's mouth.tinyurl.com\/o9sds37Receipt (Lunch for two): $39.55 - They only accept cash.tinyurl.com\/q7xtdx5Overall - You can tell I like Jing Hua Restaurant at the Qun Zhong Eating House and this is based primarily on the quality of the food. \u00c2\u00a0The remainder of the experience is functional and efficient. \u00c2\u00a0This is probably more of a 4.5 star lunch experience. \u00c2\u00a0But I thought the food was good enough to warrant rounding up. \u00c2\u00a0It is a place I would not hesitate to return to or to recommend to others.","985":"Not bad, not bad. Don't come here for the xiao long bao, they are pretty well priced but taste sort of stale... If that's possible. The pork\/seafood pan-fried dumplings, on the other hand, are delectable. The noodle dishes are also quite tasty and well priced.The menu is short, but they seem to do most things well, although I didn't try the desserts, which seemed to be the only items that were overpriced. The place can get crowded on weekends, so best to call ahead. Service is prompt, as it tends to be in these types of places. Location is wonderful for an after-meal stroll, or to grab a drink at a nearby bar.","986":"Today at Qun Zhong (aka Jing Hua), I told myself a real whopper of a tale. \u00c2\u00a0Like a serial cheater tell his or her lover, \"Don't worry baby, I'll never step out on you again\", I told myself, \"Go ahead and over order, don't worry, not like I'm going to finish everything...\"Yeah...you can imagine how that actually went over once I tasted the awesome food. \u00c2\u00a0First up were the Xiao Long Bao ($7 for an order of 7). \u00c2\u00a0They were so juicy and delicious with such delicate skins that I rationalized that it would be a crime against all things tasty if I tried to reheat them at home. \u00c2\u00a0I particularly enjoyed biting off the tops, slurping some of the soup, and stuffing each with the homemade chili sauce on the table.Next were the Fried Dumplings ($8 for 10), which were daintily small, blissfully crispy and curiously open on both ends. \u00c2\u00a0I recently read an article in the NY Times on the science of junk food, highlighting the research done by food scientists. \u00c2\u00a0One of the findings was that the \"perfect break point\" in chips is ~4 pounds of pressure per square inch. \u00c2\u00a0The crispy dumpling bottoms must be pretty darn close because I felt entirely blissed out with each crunchy chew.I ordered the Bean Sprouts with Minced Meat Sauce ($8 for a decent sized plate) as a healthier substitute for the noodles with minced meat sauce that I actually wanted, but it actually turned out to be a great choice. \u00c2\u00a0The bean sprouts were simply blanched to retain the natural crunchiness and the minced meat sauce was rich and flavorful.To close out my gluttonous solo feast, I ordered the Lotus Paste Pancake ($9). \u00c2\u00a0I vastly prefer lotus paste to red bean and this pancake massively exceeded my expectations. \u00c2\u00a0Truth be told, I wasn't sure what it would taste like aside from the rave reviews from my fellow yelpers. \u00c2\u00a0Picture a thick layer of filling (red bean or lotus paste) sandwiched between two layers of mochi with a deep fried crust on the outside and then sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. \u00c2\u00a0Don't be shy to fight for the corner pieces if you are with a large group...they are by far the best!PARTING THOUGHT: I showed at 5:50p on a Sunday and there was no line! \u00c2\u00a0Service was a breeze and the manager was wreathed in smiles and encouraged me to visit again soon!","987":"I have found dumpling nirvana. \u00c2\u00a0These steamed or fried dumplings are among my favorite dumplings anywhere (the meat is pork though so keep that in mind unless you get the vegetarian version!)You'll exclaim \"Just one more dumpling\" and eat five...but they are worth it.This small menu doesn't give you many options besides dumplings, noodles, vegetables, and two desserts. \u00c2\u00a0But my oh my, what they do they do DELICIOUSLY! \u00c2\u00a0The decor is surprisingly modern and clean. \u00c2\u00a0While they supposedly take reservations, the staff will look clueless when you ask for your reserved table. \u00c2\u00a0But luckily it doesn't get too packed and a few tables were still available on a Sunday at lunch time.The food:The regular steamed dumplings are simple, but contain a great balance of flavors (not too salty with a great balance of filling to dough). \u00c2\u00a0The fried dumplings are open at each end and are crispy little pockets of goodness. \u00c2\u00a0Another crispy piece of goodness is the Chinese pizza which is essentially the pork filling in a large sesame bun - mmm, did I just order a dumpling on steroids? \u00c2\u00a0The soup dumplings are delicate and flavorful while the vegetarian dumplings had a mild, but nice combination of vegetables. \u00c2\u00a0I thought the two noodle dishes - the cha jeong noodles and shanghai style with pork strips and preserved vegetables were consistently good, but not the best noodles in town. \u00c2\u00a0The red bean in sesame pancake was also a surprising favorite. \u00c2\u00a0I loved the crispy, thin layers over the warm red bean paste.I'm really glad I came here with a group and got to try most dishes. \u00c2\u00a0It only took me one visit to convince me that this is one of the best dumplings places in town. \u00c2\u00a0I'd readily eat all of the dumplings again...and happily accept the dumpling food coma thereafter.","988":"Oops...the skin of the Xiao Long Bao broke apart as I attempted to pick it up very cautiously, and the beautiful guts spilled out uncontrollably onto the parchment paper. This is both a good and bad sign; the good thing is that the skin is delicate and the bad sign is that I am too rowdy with this plump meaty babies.These \u00c2\u00a0Xiao Long Baos ($7++ for 7pcs) are near perfect--the ball of minced pork at the center, loose and yielding, as if itself in midmelt. My 2nd XLB landed in my spoon intact and buoyant, and I popped the entire thing comfortably in my mouth. There could be a little more of that liquefied pork gelatin but I'm just being greedy. Other dumplings variations include the steamed vegetarian dumplings stuffed with taupok bits and crunchy turnips which even non-vegetarians will delight. The Seafood and Pork Dumplings had a slightly chewy feel but the ingredients tasted fresh and not too greasy. I prefer the pan-fried version ($8++ for 10 pieces) which transformed the original chewy skin into delicate crunchy bites with tantalizing burnt aroma. This gives the pan-fried dumpling more character, as if it was a \u00c2\u00a0golden pillow case Perfect if there were more chives. The mastery achievement goes beyond the dumplings to the noodles and the desserts. The Noodle with Minced Pork & Soya Bean Sauce \u00e7\u0082\u00b8\u00e9\u0085\u00b1\u00e9\u009d\u00a2 ($5++), is wonderfully alchemized by the minced pork and age-old calculus soya bean paste that Iess salty than other specimens. The Osmanthus soup with glutinous rice ball soup ($3++) arrived hot and fragrant with warm floral inhalations. Hand-made with a spot-on dough-to-filling ratio, each tiny pop is rolled with a different flavour; lotus and walnut, black sesame, red bean and peanuts. \u00c2\u00a0Another must-try is the Crispy Red Bean Pancake ($10++) that is prepared freshly upon order. Expertly deep-fried till they are like crunchy fritters, the dark brown parcels oozes dense, sweet red bean paste with charred sesame aroma. After such a satisfying meal, I am convinced that the Han's decision to leave the menu unchanged for 25 years was a right one. Consistent quality food that can stand the test of time. Sounds unbelievable in our modern age but here is a true story.","989":"An institution along Neil road, Qun Zhong has recently been renovated and now occupies two unites. The service has improved substantially and almost everyone on the service team comes across as polite - a huge change from before! However, the legendary grouchy elderly man at the door is still there and continues to handle crowd control with impatience and a frown.This one of those restaurants with an extremely small menu, and even then there are overlaps between dishes because sauces and fillings are re-used. However, by focusing on just a few, they've really boiled it down to the dishes they've best at and famous for, and everything is absolutely delicious, although I am not a fan of the Chinese pizza. The xiao long bao are not as dainty and refined as the ones you would find elsewhere, but they are hearty and pack great flavour. My personal favourite dish, however, is their pan-fried dumpling. The skin is delightfully crisp, and this goes well with the vinegar and ginger, too. End the meal with the red bean pancake - totally worth saving a little space in your stomach for.","990":"I used to have a \"Fast, cheap and good - you can only have 2 out of 3\" poster in my office, so I could point people who needed work done to the poster. But here, you get all 3! You sit in air-conditioned comfort, take a few minutes to decide what you want from the small menu, and the food comes in about 5 minutes. You can feed a person well for around SGD16 each, which is a lot more than what I'd way about many other places in Singapore these days.","991":"XLB nazi. The boss man is a grouchy fellow. True story: We were in the queue and without everybody present, he's not gonna let you sit down. When the last car arrive, we had an 80 year old grandma making her way from the pavement to the shop. I told the boss, everyone's here, the grandmother is walking in. XLB nazi had to go see for himself, walked all the way out and verified and then allowed us in. That being said. The XLB are pretty good, thin, slightly chew skin, tasty soup inside. Noodles are made upon order. Red bean pancake is good too.It's toss up if you wanna queue up and deal with a grouchy boss or go somewhere else without a queue and less attitude.","992":"Neighborhood restaurant close to where my sister-in-law lives. Business was quite good for Sun night and the restaurant looks like it has recently expanded to neighboring store front.The dumplings were quite tasty with a nice and chewy freshly made skin and fresh pork\/seafood filling. The XLB was very juicy, a bit heavy on the peppery side. The skin was a bit too soft for my taste. The dandan noodle was so so for me as I was hoping for good chewy homemade noodle but this one wasn't quite there. The red bean pancake dessert was nicely done to wrap up the meal.Definitely a nice dinner within a few minutes walk...","993":"Pros: Newly renovated and expanded. No nonsense menu with pictures only. Not a wide variety of offering, what they do, they do well. Dan-dan noodles and fried dumplings were my favourite. Cons: Shanghai style soup dumplings tasted a *bit* too much like swine for my liking. This place was full of locals, which is usually a good sign. Nice meal, would come back if in the area.","994":"I had a really unusual experience at Jing Hua tonight. We arrived for dinner at 7pm (on a Tuesday night) and there was no queue. In fact, half the tables were gloriously empty. I had been told there would be a wait at all hours, bad service but the most ridiculously delicious dumplings in Singapore. Well, the service was actually decent and attentive by both Singapore and authentic Chinese restaurant standards (I can't say which is supposed to be worse). I didn't encounter the grumpy boss and we were seated immediately.We ordered the xiao long bao, guo tie, spinach with oyster sauce, zha jiang mian and red bean pancake. The xiao long bao was as it should be, meaning perfectly hot with lots of soup inside and a good amount of pork and seafood. Divine. The guo tie was similarly awesome - fried to crisp but served on a dry plate with none of that leaky oil puddle crap you get at alot of la mian hawker stalls. The spinach dish was generous and not salty at all and the zha jiang mian, oh what mian. Soft noodles, bowl-lickin' sauce and a good dash of crisp cucumber shreds and spinach.There was nothing bad to say about our experience (well maybe the $0.60 I had to pay for unused wet towels that couldn't be returned) and I intend to return many more times. Considering how a lot of the clientele is Japanese (I still haven't figured out why), \u00c2\u00a0I'm surprised the food is priced so reasonably. This restaurant definitely goes on my places-to-eat-regularly-when-I-run-out-of-adventurous-fuel.","995":"Oh those XLBs were spot on! So delicious, so juicy. My companion also said that their hot and sour soup was the second best she has ever had in her life.","996":"Taste is ok, but limited choices of food. Only three types of noodles and a few types of Chinese dumplings. \u00c2\u00a0May not come back , as there is nothing special to attract me .","997":"Docking one star for my latest experience. The red bean pancake is not as crispy as before, though the pot-stickers still hit the spot.","998":"Guo-Tie (pot-stickers or fried dumplings) and red-bean pancake - you can't find better ones in Singapore!Very small menu with just a few items. but everything is good. Soup dumplings are much better than those of crystal jade and imperial treasure. My favorite are the pot-stickers and red bean pancake. The redbean pancake is so good that I would go to the restaurant just to eat that.Usually you see a line and lots of japanese tourists too. I suspect it is listed on some japanese lonely planet equivalent.Prices are very reasonable too!And if the grouchy boss is there manning the counter...sigh..good luck to you.","999":"One of the better xiao long bao (northern china style pork dumplings) restaurants in Singapore and ranks (IMHO) higher than the Din Tai Fung version.The ja jiang mian, a wheat noodle dish with a spicy fermented bean minced pork sauce with julienne cucumber is consistently good, as are the fried Guo tie (similar to Japanese gyoza).The fried red bean pancake is best eaten hot and rounds off the meal nicely.Protip for first timers: the highlight of a xiao long bao is the small quantity of soup\/juice encased inside each xlb. Make sure you don't tear the skin until the xlb is safely nestled inside your soup spoon. Once it's in your spoon, gently tear a small opening in the skin to release the soup into your spoon and enjoy the soup before eating the rest of the dumpling. Watch the rest of the diners to see what they do and you should be fine!","1000":"The good: \u00c2\u00a0Dumplings (even though they try to pass them off as xiao long bao) were decent. \u00c2\u00a0Larger in size, so harder to eat, but still tasty. \u00c2\u00a0The red bean pancake was a nice way to finish the meal. \u00c2\u00a0Service, once inside, was fast. \u00c2\u00a0The bad: \u00c2\u00a0Tried about 5 different dishes, and they were all just ok. \u00c2\u00a0Yeah, just ok. \u00c2\u00a0I was definitely surprised given the positive reviews, but it just didn't blow my mind in any way. \u00c2\u00a0I did queue for awhile (and got cut in line a few times) which is a little annoying, but some patrons were helpful in showing me the ropes while queueing and ordering. \u00c2\u00a0The ugly: \u00c2\u00a0Doesn't come close to the hype on Yelp. \u00c2\u00a0I wouldn't make an effort to go here, let alone queue. \u00c2\u00a0You can find equally tasty (and better) items at about a dozen other places a stones throw away. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Of course the tourists wouldn't know that...","1001":"This restaurant was closed for a while and they are back big but not better. They finally expanded the restaurant to double units.This place is very popular with tourists and locals \u00c2\u00a0who love to try their famous xiao long bao and guo tie. They have a limited menu but the food is pretty good. The only thing is the service here is rather bad. Well, you got to put up with their bad attitude to enjoy the great eats. \u00c2\u00a0In fact, many often refers the owner to be a food nazi.I love their pan fried guo tie, zha jiang mian and pan fried red bean pancake.","1002":"As others have mentioned, this place has a perpetual queue from lunch to dinner. I have been past this a lot of times, and figured 8pm on a Tuesday night there would be zero queue - I was wrong, but it was only four people, so we got a table in less than five minutes.They only have 15 items on the menu, and having read up on what to try earlier, we oredered a handful of things. First up was their signature dish, the Little Juicy Steamed Dumplings (7 for $7.50) which were great on their own, and amazing with a little sauce and ginger. Second, was the Noodles with Sliced Pork and Sichuan Vegetable ($5.35) that was very average, with overcooked noodles and less pork than at a bris. Third up was the Hot and Sour Soup ($3.20) which was spectacular, probably one of the best I have ever had, so delicious. Finally got a Tiger Beer ($9.60\/ lg bottle) which was unusually frosty.It is a pity the Chinese Pizza was not available, worth trying next time. If they can also add-in the GST to the prices, it would make it a bit more honest.","1003":"Their meat pizza\/pancake is worth a visit every time. The meat filling used in their guotie is the same as the pizza\/pancake I suspect so you are better off going with the pizza\/pancake if you had to choose one.","1004":"The xiao long bao lives up to its reputation, but I have to admit that I like the potstickers even better. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and inexpensive; the menu is simple; and the food well-done. Be sure to leave room for the red bean paste pastry! Typically, I'm not a fan of bean-based desserts, but this one is great!","1005":"I can understand the appeal of this place, but I can't say that I am blown away by the dumplings. BUT, I can understand why this place would appeal to some. Their steamed xiao long baos, and pretty much all kinds of dumplings have the same shrimp pork filling, which has a delicate seafood sweetness to it, especially in the xiao long baos. This taste is distinctly lighter than the taste offered in places such as din tai fung or paradise dynasty, so you don't get the \"urgh too much pork oil\" kinda fullness at the end of the meal. Noteworthy is their minced meat noodles. Very starchy, very flavorful, and I love the chinese spinach that comes with it. Also, their ginger is sweet and tasty, and the vinegar has a hint of sweetness that I like. Last, but definitely not least, the red bean pancake was delicious. The crust is slightly crispy and sticky (think fried nian gao), and the red bean is not overly sweet. Just nice. Yum!","1006":"I want to come back to try the chinese pizza and pan fried dumplings (aka fried food...) The other couple sitting at our table recommended the pan fried guo tie over the xiao long bao (!!)Anyway, thankfully we got here somewhat early and didn't have to wait. We did have to share a table though, but that turned out for the better! More on that later.Ordered:1. Xiao long bao ($7.50) - had heard so much about these famed dumplings and so had to try them! What was amazing was that the skin was really springy\/chewy and did NOT break, nor was there much fear that it would! This is very very rare. Quite a bit of soup inside, bf remarked that it is a lighter taste than one would find maybe at Din Tai Fung or something. Later he expounded upon this saying that if you eat it at one gulp, there's more flavour. 2. Zha Jiang Mian - pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing. Quite addictive though!3. Red bean pancake aka guo bing ($9) - here is where our lovely table companion couple came in. They had ordered one (whereas we'd waited to place the dessert order, just in case) and it looked pretty big, with 14 pieces I believe. I very much doubted that the bf and I would be able to finish one on our own (nor would it be a very good idea), and these deep fried things are just never as good reheated. Especially without the aid of a toaster oven! So, I nudged the bf to ask if they'd consider sharing it (since I also doubted they would be finishing it on their own). He did ask, and they said okay! Yay :) I didn't like it so much, it was really crispy on the outside but rather chewy on the inside (this, the bf liked - he likes chewy stuff). I would've just preferred more crisp. Anyway, it just led me to realize that their specialty seems to be making things chewy (read: the dumpling skin, the pancake skin). Back to the pancake - it had substantial red bean filling which wasn't too sweet, that's a plus!As another Yelper mentioned, compulsory $1.60 tagged on for the wet towels and peanuts (non-returnable because they don't charge service charge).","1007":"forget about din tai fun or crystal jade. this guy is the best. i've tried xiao long bao in china, taiwan, hong kong, and of cos LA and singapore. nothing comes close. forget the ambience. Zero. forget service (at least you dun have to leave a tip). best XLB ever. period.","1008":"Solid, affordable, no frills. \u00c2\u00a0It's close to my office, but I would frequent this place even if it was slightly out of the way. \u00c2\u00a0Fried dumplings and noodles the best. \u00c2\u00a0Quick and easy place with an authentic ring.","1009":"Absolutely great food for reasonable price. Authentic indian cuisine and great service. We ate several times here during our stay in lanson place.Prefer cash only but they actually take any foreign currency. Helpful!!!","1010":"We were in search of a cheap and simple place to grab some food and we ended up here. They serve Indian Muslim Food and Thai Muslim Sea Food in a simple setting with pictures of the food on the walls and plastic furniture. Service was very friendly but also very slow and prone to mistakes (drink order had to be made three times before it was correctly brought to the table).We sampled a selection of different dishes where the best was the black pepper chicken that came in a flavorful sauce with nice vegetables but the chicken was clearly low quality with a spongy feel to it. The butter chicken was a big disappointment as the sauce lacked the buttery feel and flavor. We also had the curry chicken which was decent. The fresh fruit juices are made to order and fresh. In general this is an ok place and considering the prices (4 of us ate a decent sized meal for less than 40 SGD) it deserves three stars. To get more mainly the food would have to improve substantially and the service somewhat.","1011":"I've been in Singapore for less than a week but I've already eaten here twice. And I can't wait to come back again. The food is delicious and so so cheap. Nana Teh Tarik is situated right next to the bustling Killiney Kopitiam. Its a pretty modest restaurant that is open to the street and filled with about 15 tables. Its open 24 hours a day, making it a lifesaver late at night when few other places are open. I've noticed that it is relatively calm and less crowded during the daytime but come 8 or 9 o'clock, it gets pretty busy. The menu is quite large so you can have anything from a full meal to a light snack, depending on what you're feeling like. Sometimes it can be difficult to get a server's attention, especially if you have to compete with a bunch of other tables. Still, the food is totally worth it. My experience is limited to the uttapam and martabak, but both were fantastic. The egg and onion uttapam consisted of two large uttapam with a coconut chutney and tomato chutney. Both were spicy and so flavorful. The uttapam with tasty and rich without being greasy. The chicken and cheese martabak is fantastic. Its a flakey, buttery flatbread that is stuffed with whatever ingredients you like. It is served with a thick, spicy tomato gravy that goes perfectly with the buttery and rich martabak. It takes a little while to be made, so keep that in mind. I could come here almost every day, but I have forced myself to try other options in the area for variety's sake. Still, I'll definitely be heading back often.","1012":"I have tried the signature spring chicken and the individual pieces. Conclusion is the spring chicken is still the best.Individual pieces probably lost some of the moisture during the frying process, and somehow is not as moist as the whole spring chicken.Go try it","1013":"5 stars for the fabulously fried chicken!I am probably one of the earliest customer when they had only one store right here on the 2nd floor of City Plaza. Back then the Q was manual and manageable.Today we had to Q to get a number, 1106, when the board was showing 1091. There were lots of people waiting for their numbers to be called forward to get their seats. I had to walk around City Plaza to look at wholesale dated China made fashion (no pun intended) ranging from lingerie to casuals to stage gowns. I thought maybe looking at luggages would be harmless but it seems only 2 luggage stores were opened in the evening. We passed by Arnold's a few times to check the Q number, and finally we were fitted next to the hand wash area. We were here for the chicken, washing hands is a good thing, closer to the wash area is not that bad.Chicken - Yes. All the reviews continues to be true. It's tastes just as good then as it is now. The unforgettable crispiness of the thin skin, the moist juicy meat, even the breast meat is white moist and testifies against the other famous chicken chain stores! cough*KFC*coughAnd if you examine the bones like CSI, no black blood or bloody between meat and bone. It's seems they got the temperature and timing perfect ! Flash fried I say.The fries are so so, the coleslaw is better then average. The chilli and ketchup is standard fare. The service is prompt and don't make people wait. You know what will make this place legendary? Better chilli. Probably include a garlic version of chilli too. I am kinda glad I don't live near here, otherwise it will be difficult to stay away.","1014":"Juicy crispy fried chicken and other treats. Well organized. Pretty fast wait time despite the long queue. Thoughtful hand washing station. Washroom in the mall. Wish they had Heinz ketchup!","1015":"Love it love it love!! \u00c2\u00a0Not much fats under the skin of the chicken. \u00c2\u00a0Issue is can't choose the parts u want. \u00c2\u00a0Mesh is smooth and nice. \u00c2\u00a0Sorry KFC this chicky got u running .","1016":"5 stars for the fried chicken. The fried chicken is a bit spicy, with hints of spices in the batter. It is moist and juicy and oh so good. It is way better than other fast food chain for fried chicken.The sides are nothing to be shout about, very average. Actually I would not bother with it. Just order the fried chicken and be happy with a calorie laden meal. The wait can be quite long. I waited for about 20-30 minutes for a take-away pack of fried chicken on a Friday evening. At other times (weeknights), the food was served within 5-10 minutes when dining in. Maybe they are busier on weekends.","1017":"This is a review of a solo dinner at Arnold's Fried Chicken on the second level of City Plaza.This is a difficult review to write. \u00c2\u00a0Do I review it based on the chicken alone? \u00c2\u00a0How much do I factor in the sides? \u00c2\u00a0What about the overall experience? \u00c2\u00a0What about the time it takes? \u00c2\u00a0What about the basic fast food ambiance?First, Arnold's had been on my list to check-out for awhile. \u00c2\u00a0I thought \"what better time than to celebrate the US's National Fried Chicken Day\".They have a slightly unique system. \u00c2\u00a0You go to the counter that is just outside the restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0There may be a line-up. \u00c2\u00a0You place your order. \u00c2\u00a0You are given a receipt and a paper slip with a number. \u00c2\u00a0There are numbers on a digital display on the wall. \u00c2\u00a0Plus, the numbers are called out. \u00c2\u00a0I think they may also have a system where you can get a text when your number is reached. \u00c2\u00a0You pay when you return to get your table and food.tinyurl.com\/n6vfstcAfter placing your order and getting your number, you go join the masses to await your table and food. \u00c2\u00a0There are people everywhere awaiting there table. \u00c2\u00a0There are some seats but most people are standing. \u00c2\u00a0Some folks (like myself) go for a bit of a walkabout or take a break in one of the nearby massage chairs. \u00c2\u00a0Sooner or later, your lucky time will come. \u00c2\u00a0You will hear them call it and see it pop up on the board.tinyurl.com\/nynk6kjThis was a Sunday evening. \u00c2\u00a0I placed my order at 6:12 PM. \u00c2\u00a0My number was called at 7:05 PM. \u00c2\u00a0My dinner arrived at my table at 7;20 PM. \u00c2\u00a0At the end of the meal, there was another 10 to 15 minute wait for the carry-out portion of my order.They do have a lot of staff running about doing this and that. \u00c2\u00a0For the most part, they were friendly and helpful. \u00c2\u00a0They even quickly defrayed the commotion prompted by an angry woman who had been away when her number was called.The ambiance is pretty much reminiscent of a fast-food restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0It is bright and colourful. \u00c2\u00a0The staff busily works at keeping it clean.tinyurl.com\/mf5rxjoThe fried chicken was very good. \u00c2\u00a0It had a sweetness to the flavour that I do not associate with fried chicken. \u00c2\u00a0This was accentuated more by the sweet hot sauce they provide. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was straight out the fryer. \u00c2\u00a0It was piping hot. \u00c2\u00a0The batter was crisp. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was tender and very juicy. \u00c2\u00a0If I could change one thing, I would add a little more salt. \u00c2\u00a0I loved it. \u00c2\u00a0Two hours later, the leftovers were still very good.tinyurl.com\/ltczspbThe sides were certainly not anything to write home about. \u00c2\u00a0I do not eat mayo-based coleslaw.

I mostly ignored them. \u00c2\u00a0I did really enjoy the small buns. \u00c2\u00a0They were especially nice when dipped into the gravy from the whipped potatoes. \u00c2\u00a0If someone was sharing this combo with me, they would have to be very crafty to keep their bun from my prying hands. \u00c2\u00a0I am not sure that sounds right. \u00c2\u00a0But, there it is.Also, considering this was a two person combo, the portions for the sides were not very generous.tinyurl.com\/llr79deThe whipped potatoes & gravy are the kind that one would get at a school canteen. \u00c2\u00a0Fortunately, for me, while many shun them, I kind of enjoy them. \u00c2\u00a0These did not come with the combo for two. \u00c2\u00a0I added them to my order.tinyurl.com\/kmwye2lReceipt (Combo for two + Whole Spring Chicken): $38.80tinyurl.com\/mwpdfpcOverall - I am giving Arnold's four stars.

The food is pretty good.They outclass KFC.","1019":"Truly one of the best tasting fried chicken I've had. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken meat is tender and juicy and tasty!!! Very satisfying meal!Complete with the potato mash which is very smooth and tasty. Much like KFC but not as salty. I love their coleslaw better than KFC and Popeye's Chicken. The salad dressing is not too heavy and still refreshing. It's just really really nice!Definitely coming back again!","1020":"If you like fried chicken, you'll love Arnold.I am not a big fried food person, but this is good fried chicken. The chicken is fresh, not frozen, and you can taste it. It is juicier than KFC, moist and tender. The flour coating is fresh with a light spice, and somehow seems less oily.We had both the spring chicken and the regular chicken. I actually like the regular chicken better. The chicken tasted more flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0(If you order by piece, you can request for the chicken part, and I am so thankful for that. No more breast meat!)They do not have ketchup, but a sweet chilli sauce that tasted like a cross between ketchup and chilli. Definitely mild enough even for kids. \u00c2\u00a0The fries and the cross-cut potatoes were good too.3.5 stars only because I am not a fried chicken fan. Nothing personal, Arnold.Now, if only fried food is not so fattening...","1021":"Oh mah gosh. This chicken is magic. This batter, this juicy flesh, is tasty, tasty magic. I cannot be more thankful for the person who brought this here to our shores.You walk into this dingy mall, and it's a little bit like ascending to the heavens - hop on the escalator, and... escalate to chicken-y delights. I kid you not, it's right there at the top of the escalator, on the second floor.Eating here? Order from the first guys you see. Then grab a seat. But if you're taking it away, then head straight to the main counter, and tackle that massive menu sitting before you. I got a little lost today - I've been fortunate to have people buy this to parties so I've never had to buy this myself before this experience, but I knew what my end goal was, so I did not allow myself to be fazed. After all, I had this chicken in my sights.First-timers? You'll want a two-piece meal. Hungry? Try the half-spring meal. Me? I'll have both please. Once you see that chicken, you might forget that the coleslaw serving is tiny. Thank goodness the fries are decent, but mostly, that chicken will turn any frown upside down.","1022":"This place is so good, I must say people from Singapore are talking about this place and had no idea what it is, so in July 2014 I went and it was delectable. For most Singaporeans they always look for nice food. It really does not disappoint because once you eat at the hawker centers too much it gets boring. I must say the food is cheap here. Geylang di waktu petang!","1023":"Forget KFC or Popeye's. Arnold's is local, and this is where Fried Chicken Mecca is at, I promise. I love my fried chicken every now and then, but Arnold's chicken makes me want to have a daily fix. Avoid this place at all costs if you are on a diet! You have been warned.Located inside this seedy mall, Arnold's gets a crazy queue going at lunch and dinner times. Even when I went early just before 6pm, I still had to stand outside and wait for my queue number to be rung up. Be prepared to wait.You're assigned a table, order and pay at the counter, then they serve up your chicken in about 15 to 20 minutes. I find the chicken significantly less greasy than other place, and it's a beautiful golden colour and doesn't have the taste of old oil that's been reused too many times. They cook your order on the spot and use FRESH chicken that's not been frozen, so the quality of the meat is infinitely better.I don't know what sorcery they dabble in, but even the chicken breast is tender and succulent. My mind screamed that it was impossible, because chicken breast is often dry and tough. The skin was crisp perfection, crunching as I bit into each piece.The side dishes of coleslaw, fries and mashed potato weren't great and very forgettable. I didn't finish them anyway.If you order a set and wish to exchange for other parts, you have to pay a little more for thigh and drumstick portions. You also have to pay if you want mayonnaise. There is service here, but the staff not particularly helpful. They are always in a rush as they have such a high turnover rate.","1024":"Chicken - fantastic. Better than finger lickin good. Sides - drab. Forgettable and in supermodel portions. Ambience - confusing. You think it's a fast food place, but it's more of a restaurant. So don't think your chicken is getting to you anytime soon. On the whole, the chicken makes up for the less than efficient way the place is run. It comes hot, fresh, juicy and tasty and it'll make you forgive everything else :p","1025":"I used to get my fried chicken fix from KFC, but I have to say that Arnold's is just that much tastier. Whether it's because it's Malaysian (people always say the KFC in Malaysia tastes better than the Singapore one!) \u00c2\u00a0or not, the chicken here just tends to be juicier, and the chicken skin is tasty without being too fatty.You can order the fried in pieces, but I personally prefer the half spring chicken - it 's more tender and juicy. The sides are decent too.Queues here can be pretty insane during lunch time - it observes a rather strange system where you order your food at the counter before they seat you. You're better off ordering takeaway from the counter if you're in a rush! For real big fans you can order catering and delivery as well.Not the most convenient place to get to at City Plaza though it's their most central branch - the closest MRT is Paya Lebar but it's still quite a distance to walk from the MRT. Look out for the Watsons, it's right next door on the 2nd level.","1026":"great fried chicken. I love the hougang branch, something decent up north. But getting abit expensive","1027":"Parked under the wings of a sorry excuse of a mall - City Plaza, Arnold's Fried Chicken needs more outlets. Come to town! Come to the heartlands! Yes, they've got a delivery service now but it's erratic - sometimes have, sometimes don't have.The chicken's amazing. Delightfully fresh, flavourful and succulent, it's a wonder how they can keep even chicken breast meat juicy. As for sides, their thin and crispy natural chips and tangy coleslaw are the best, perfect accompaniment to the main show. Typing this makes me foresee my diet plans slowly seeping away.This outlet is always crowded, prepare for more crowds this month as it's a popular fast-breaking place for Muslims. To accommodate more people, the tables and chairs are squeezed very close to each other; and with the chit-chat chirping all around you, most times it feels like a hen house inside. Don't brood over it though. A taste of Arnold's chicken will soon soothe your ruffled feathers, and leave you cackling like a mother hen.","1028":"A friend organised a movie marathon in her obscure estate last weekend. There aren't any eateries nearby and her house is out of the way, so we ordered Arnold's Fried Chicken to be delivered to her place for our dinner. There were six of us, so we ordered quite a bit of food to go around.To think that Arnold's Fried Chicken has been around before I was even born, and I only discovered them last week.I loved the buns, onion rings and criss-cross fries, but found the chicken rather bland. I had the bliss of getting the oily parts and the meat was dry. Nyeh. The gang liked it, but I didn't. Call me silly, but I still prefer KFC's crispy chicken. It's cheaper too.","1029":"Oh Arnold's you've certainly got it right! Love Arnold's fried chicken - call me crazy but I feel like it's a somewhat healthier version of fried chicken compared to the other popular joints. Perhaps its because they don't cover the chicken pieces in as much batter? Well whatever it is it doesn't feel as oily when you eat it. \u00c2\u00a0They don't just serve chicken, they have fish and squid as well. It also comes with a huge array of sides - from coleslaw to criss cut fries (YUM!), wedges, onion rings - and with cheese sauce as well! Sounds amazing huh! Also love that it's Halal, so it's an easy choice when organising gatherings. This place is incredibly popular, be prepared to wait. But I assure you it's worth it :)","1030":"This used to be one of the hidden gem in Geylang and over the last few years, they had expanded to other 2 outlets in the north\/east side of Singapore. Once you tried the fried chicken here, you don't want to go back to KFC. The chicken is not dry. It is fresh, tender and flavorful. If you are in the mood to devour chicken, go for their spring chicken instead of the 2 pcs chicken. :) You won't regret it. Well, You just don't want to count your calories when you are eating it.It can get rather packed during lunch and dinner times. You got to queue for the great stuff. During ramadan, they give priority to the customers who are break fast. The other 2 outlets are at Buangkok Green and Pasir Ris","1031":"For a tiny fast food joint located in a relatively obscure part of Singapore, Arnold's Fried Chicken enjoys a rather huge volume of diners. Queues are relatively common, considering the limited seating. One way to beat that is to order take away, as it only takes 5-10mins to get your order and head somewhere else to enjoy your food. The fried chicken though, is relatively so-so in my opinion. It is rather pricey, compared to other fast food joints. I can honestly say that the only good part about the chicken is the crispy skin. The meat on the other hand, is fairly bland and tasteless. So unless they are going to start selling chicken skins as an item, I think you'll be safer off with the other fried chicken joints.","1032":"If you like fried chicken this one'a certainly better than KFC, be it the chicken, the mash potatoes , coleslaw or crisscut fries. The buns they have are quite good actually! Value for money stuff","1033":"The fried spring is the juiciest I've had, more moist than KFC though not that great in spice levels. Their potato platter definitely meets carb cravings- the wedges are long and thick, nachos are crispy and fries are wonderful. Although the mashed potatoes are very soft and smooth, I find the sauce hard to describe. Good, but I've had better (Popeyes still does the best mashed potatoes). My only gripe is that the coleslaw is small-sized; to me, the coleslaw is quite good, not drenched in sauce. Overall, Arnold's is worth the calories. :)","1034":"The best fried chicken in Singapore! The chickens are tender, crispy and moist! The batter is really good. Another of my favorite is the onion rings. It is truly onion ringlets and not some fake onions mixed with lots of flour. The outlet at City Plaza can be quite packed with customers though so to get seats, you may have to wait awhile. And if it happens to be during the fasting month, don't ever think of doing a walk in because this place will already be reserved by others. Besides friend chicken, they serve fish and chips too which is not too bad either. If you order a meal, it usually comes along with some fries, fried bun and coleslaw. The service is quite fast but then again, it depends on the number of customers at that moment. I have never had a bad encounters so far with Arnold's Fried Chicken. For them to come up with delivery optiion is truly a genius idea! For sure, once you take your first bite on their fried chickens, you would not want any other fried chickens elsewhere.","1035":"This is my virgin kaiseki and it was very memorable. Everything was so beautiful. It was like eating little pieces of art. There were a lot more courses than listed on the menu.The flavors were very simple but their freshness made them distinct. I'm not going to describe every course since it would take forever. Plus the menu changes with the season so every time is a new experience. Instead, I'll just focus on the few dishes that impressed me.The bonito smoke with hay was my favorite. Bonito is a strong fish. The smoke lends itself well to the bonito without overpowering and creates a different texture.The maguro was magnificent. We were given the otoro and akami . The otoro is an overrated cut of the tuna. The akami is by far my favorite because it has more flavor and a better texture. Chef Yoshiyuki agrees.The kinmedai was very elegant. It's a type of snapper but fattier and more flavorful than a regular red snapper. Grilling was the perfect treatment for the kinmedai.The entire meal was beautiful but these dishes were great. Will RTE if possible.","1036":"There are three options for lunch: we decided on the priciest $180++ omakase menu. The space is beautiful and quite dramatic. Softly lit too. Each course is beautifully and carefully prepared: we had yuba (delicate tofu skin) with uni and fresh wasabi, appetizer of lily root balls, smokey dashi clear soup with a beautiful white fleshed fish in it, flounder sashimi (Karei), toro sashimi with soya sauce foam (very molecular!) and cubes of akami, various grilled fish, one with rice like a nigiri sushi but sitting in a bowl of stock, and the filler dish of steamed rice and baby sardines and delicious pickles and soup. Dessert was a wafer like ice cream and as a birthday treat, Japanese fruits and a Sakura mochi were presented. Yoshiyuki-San was very polite and quite friendly. His other chef spoke better English and also engaged with guests. We enjoyed ourselves, and it was lovely to have a kaiseki meal so like the ones we had in Japan -- beautiful small dishes, carefully crafted reflecting the season (it's spring!) and showcasing pretty cutlery and tableware. A treat.","1037":"Harvest is currently my local haunt.Want a beer and a whinge while you watch the footy? Come to Harvest!Want a feisty local pushing happy hour buckets of beer onto your table and popping tops whenever you get moderately low? Come to Harvest!Want to pay no more than $6.50 a beer? Come to Harvest!Want to be where the action is any night of the week? Come to Harvest!Want to enjoy the heat while being close to the water? Come to Harvest!I've never eaten here and probably never will --- but for a beer or 10? Come to Harvest! Cos it's tops!","1038":"Everyone kept telling me \"you're in Singapore, go somewhere and get the chilli crab!\"... so after an evening wander I ended up out the front of Harvest Seafood Restaurant.Look, the food isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad either. If you choose to give the chilli crab a go, have it spicy. The mild is very 'meh'.And, this place is expensive. A pint of Tiger beer cost me $14. For. A. Beer. Wasn't happy about that, especially with the amount of competition along the water.The waiters were attentive and seemed happy enough, but the other stuff does offset that.","1039":"Great seafood place. Ordered salted egg yolk crab and chilli crab along with other side dishes. The Sri Lankan Crab was huge. If you are bringing a family of 6, two crabs will be more than enough. Price was reasonable and the restaurant was along the river and have a great view of the Fullerton Hotel.","1040":"Good things come in small packages. This hidden gem hosts beautiful decor, a small but solid menu, and a laid back vibe. \u00c2\u00a0Yes, it has a hipster vibe, but is also very minimalist (think gray and beige) with succulents scattered throughout.The foodThe nam ban bao is the standout here. \u00c2\u00a0A perfectly fried piece of tender chicken is nestled between the fluffy bao for a few perfect bites. \u00c2\u00a0The salted egg yolk shrimp had a nice crunch, but could have used a little more seasoning. \u00c2\u00a0The pork belly brings me back to traditional braised pork belly I loved as a kid. \u00c2\u00a0It's served au jus style with a side of stock! \u00c2\u00a0The truffle fries were wonderfully salty here too.I'd definitely return for the good vibes, relaxed atmosphere and good food.","1041":"This place was really awesome!! Great ambiance, and amazing bao. We were craving bao on our trip and found it online and absolutely were not disappointed. We tried 6 different bao and loved all of them--my favorite was the crab! Also in a fun part of Chinatown so you can grab drinks after dinner.","1042":"Such a cute little spot on Horne Road. I appreciate that they focus on giving baos a bit of a twist.The baos are all Asian inspired, with flavours like bulgogi, salted egg shrimp, and teriyaki chicken. I stuck with the classic (slow-braised pork belly) and the nanban chicken, which was a deep fried chicken with Japanese tartar sauce.The classic had all the right flavours involved, however I found the meat a tad dry. I still think Ubin Kitchen on Joo Chiat Road holds the title for best classic bao in SG! I really liked the nanban chicken, though- perfectly deep fried and the sauce paired well.Ambiance is simple, though it can get a bit loud and echo-y when there's a lot of people. Other than that, a cute cafe worth checking out if you're looking for something a little different!","1043":"Nice space but average food. A 2.5 stars review.The baos are tiny for the prices that they are charging - about $5.50 for one depending on the fillings. You'll need \u00c2\u00a0at least 2 to fill you up (they also require a min of 2 baos per order). So a meal here will set you up for more than $10. Aside from the price, the taste doesn't quite make the cut. While the nanban chicken (fried chicken) is nicely fried and served out piping hot and crispy, the marinate on the chicken doesn't come through and there is also too much mayo with the tiny piece of chicken.The chilli crab bun is a take on a Singaporean favorite. While it is full of real shredded crabs, the accompanying sauce is a diluted chilli liquid that has nothing of the usual eggy crabby gravy of a good chilli crab sauce. Place is typically hipster with nice simple decor but the taste and value of the food is not enough to bring me back.","1044":"I actually really like this place, despite my distaste for most hipster things in Singapore these days. They take reservations online, accept credit cards, have great service, and free wifi.Food-wise... I got two buns; the salted egg shrimp and the nanban along with a side of salad. Gosh! I LOVE the nanban. Freshly fried with some lettuce within, with an awesome tartar sauce. I should have gotten two nanbunsss. The salted egg shrimp was okay - could have been better if the shrimp was deep fried and the sauce could actually coat the shrimp, instead of dripping everywhere. The bun itself was soft and slightly sweet. Yum!I finished off with a banana walnut sundae, quite delish. Would return.","1045":"The Bao Makers took over the colourful Windowsill Pies shop that moved to Upper Thomson. Instead of keeping the similar type of decoration, the Bao Makers stripped everything to white. From the outside the caf\u00c3\u00a9 stood out quite well due to the colour. On the inside, they also kept the minimalistic industrial look with the cemented walls and wooden furnitures, perfect for hipsters to hangout. We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I'd go and try the bao at this place. So without further contemplation I dragged hubby in and ordered two baos, the chili crab and Korean bulgogi pork. I like both but the succulent and spicy chili crab definitely delivered more flavour especially with the crispy golden bao. I really like the idea of infusing the local dish into the bao, something that I never seen before at other places. The filling for both baos were sufficient. Since Hubby was craving for dessert he also ordered a pretty serving of lemon meringue sundae. The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices. It was delicious but a bit awkward to be called a sundae except if you break the meringue and the sponge cake, then mix the whole thing together with the ice cream.  We had a good time at the Bao Makers and we hope they will be a one stop shop for bao and able to come up with a lot of different fillings next time we go to Singapore.","1046":"As I rarely come to this area, I have no idea the existence of this cafe, thanks to Natalie. From Lavender MRT station, the walk takes around 10 minutes, but do bring an umbrella if the weather forecast is rain as there is no shelter for most parts of the walk: When I think of 'Bao' (Chinese bread), I expect a Chinese style cafe or something like that but when I entered the cafe, it was different from what I expected. I didn't read the review or find out about more this cafe as I wanted to get an element of surprise and I did! The cafe is quite spacious as there is good amount of privacy between you and the other customers. If you are in a big group (around 6-10), you be pleased to know there is a Long table and if needed, they just add a table or two. Perfect for some catching up as its quiet and not crowded for most of the time, according to another Yelper. Orders are self service and free wifi is available but you have to ask the staff for the password. It would be nice if they could leave the password either on the table or on the receipt. Staff were friendly and more importantly no sign of impatience or pressure to leave the cafe even though the group had finish the food for quite some time and got lost in the wonderful conversation. I ordered the Namban Chicken and Classic (check my photo of the menu for more information) and I find them to be my liking for my taste bud. Not the best but decent enough for me to make another trip back to try out the other flavours. Prices is reasonable and portion is definitely value for money. Overall, this is a great cafe for catching up and enjoying the \"bao\"! Do drop by if you are nearby or have a craving for \"Bao\".","1047":"Ambience is chic and hip. Love the mix of raw cement walls and wooden floors. Interesting menu although the helping size seems a tad small. The lobster roll and salted egg shrimp Bao were better than the seafood carbonara. The shake mentaiko rice bowl met with immediate approval complete with the onsen egg!","1048":"My new favorite neighborhood spot. I love places that just make a few things but do them well. The Nanban Chicken bao was my favorite. The chicken is juicy, and the skin perfectly crispy and light, and the Japanese tartar sauce is just right. My wife had the classic pork belly and salted egg shrimp bao, which were also both excellent but not quite as good as the chicken for my taste. Lastly, their truffle fries were a bit on the salty side, but full of cheesy truffley goodness. Besides the food, the decor is right up my alley. Clean and modern, wide open spaces and gray and brown accents. Service was super fast, which is another big plus with places that have small menus. We had our bao in less than five minutes after ordering, which is great for a case of mid-afternoon munchies.","1049":"clean and open concept cafe. Finally a cafe where there is actually space and i don't feel claustrophobic. Headed straight in. Ordered an Ice- Latte to start, 5 minutes later its done and i have to say its really pretty good. Being at a Bao place. You've got to try the baos right? so i went straight for the shrimp with salted egg yolk one. The bummer was that it was a minimum order of 2 baos, and i really had wanted to sit down and relax and not stuff myself with 2 baos. But i understand the procedure as steaming just one bao would be quite a waste of steam i suppose. so i had to go for the traditional one. The classic \"kong bak\" bao\/pork belly. The shrimp one could do with a more stronger salted egg yolk sauce, but all in all, the shrimp was fresh and crisp. As for the pork belly bao, it would be nice if it had a thicker sauce around the meat. The staff here are friendly and would go the extra mile to help. So the next time you're around horne road or going to catch a soccer match at the jalan besar stadium. Come over and get yourself a great cup of coffee and some baos. A great place for an afternoon snack, brunch or a light dinner.","1050":"Outstanding, this is my favourite nasi lemak in Singapore. Uses basmati rice, which absorbs the coconut milk a little better than ordinary jasmine rice. The rice is somehow flavourful without being too heavy with sauce. Sambal was good as well, both sweet and spicy. The other ingredients were about par for the course, but I reckon if you get the rice and sambal right, you can't really go wrong.Queue took about 30 minutes around noon on a weekday.","1051":"Paya Lebar Square.. looks good and decided to try. First time.Served by a \u00e7\u0099\u00be\u00e4\u00b8\u0087 cashier. The other crew were great.. busy.Wanted to order different stuff but \u00e7\u0099\u00be\u00e4\u00b8\u0087 pointed me to the fixed set menu on the displayed board. In the end, got what I wanted.Ordered Chengdol, \u00e7\u0099\u00be\u00e4\u00b8\u0087 \u00c2\u00a0 'Sold out'. Its 12noon and I'm not convinced that's the answer.I would prefer a truth than a lie.Didn't know it's a franchise shop as I was hoping to patronize an individual setting up his\/her biz.So much for dedication to works and service with a smile.","1052":"Last year, I had one the best dishes I've had in my life. This was a much hyped trip to the Adam Hawker Center to try the famous Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak. I have watched many videos including YouTube food blogger, Mark Weins, in my preparation for my trip to Singapore and for this dish. Be warned of the immediate long lines as this is by far the busiest stand in the hawker center. I remember waiting for a half-hour and seeing my friends enjoy their dishes from the other vendors. The wait is long, but luckily, you will be able to relate and potentially make some friends while waiting. Once you reach the register, you will have the option to order one of seven dishes depending on how much variety \/ portion \/ adventure you prefer. It begins with the simple \"Flash Meal\" of rice, eggs, cucumbers, and anchovies to the right spectrum of the \"Royal Rumble\" which has all of that + the side dishes and is about 3x the size. I wanted to get the full experience and understand exactly what makes this place unique, different, and regularly visited by the president of Brunei (one of the famous regular customers) of this establishment. Hence, I ordered the \"Royal Rumble.\" - Royal Rumble (+5\/5) - This dish was incredible. I had to spend about 5 minutes in the beginning to analyze and take the pictures that it deserved. The Nasi Lamak is packed with coconut steamed rice, anchovies, fried egg, chicken, pandan wrapped leaf thingy, and flaming hot chili paste. It is a one, two, punch. - One of the greatest dishes I've had and a beautiful representation of Singapore and its neighboring cuisines. Make sure to use your left hand to eat this dish as utensils will do no justice. Overall, this is hands down a beautiful dish and one that would make me fly to Singapore for!","1053":"Royal rumble ($5.90) - 3.5 starsIt was a 15-20 min wait on a Monday around noon. The good: probably that the fried egg wasn't over cooked (the yolk was all yellow and didn't have a blue-ish grey exterior), the fish was less dry than the one at No 1 Nasi Lemak next door, the rice was light, and there were no peanuts (not a big fan). Otah was alright. But overall I'm not terribly impressed. I guess I'm not picky about my nasi lemak and I'm content with nasi lemak and nasi padang dishes at most places.","1054":"I actually timed the queue, it came to 39 minutes. He will sign first \"come here and what do you want\" then \"eat here or take away\" (I was confused, hence putting it out there for future visitors). The rice was a bit soft for my taste, too salty, and with not enough coconut (but you can really smell the pandan as a result). The ikan billis was not sickening for a change. The chicken wing is a chicken wing, I mean there's not many ways to improve on a chicken wing, it's a decent wing as far as wings go. No peanuts. The sauce was the best item, sweet and with incredible scent. I could not indulge fully in the sauce due to avoiding spicy foods at the moment, which may be why I was less than enthusiastic about the whole thing, which I did not consider to be worth 39 minutes of queue (prices have bumped up too, $3.90 for the chicken set). I prefer the nasi lemaks I've had around Joo Chiat. My wife, who ate most of her sauce, thought it WAS worth it, so I'll average our ratings and give it 4*. Personally, I'll try \"No. 1\" next time, its queue is considerably shorter and you get peanuts with your nasi lemak.","1055":"Review for Nov2016 - Queue wasn't too long, maybe 15-20 minutes during the lunch hour and can't recall if I got the Full House or Royal Flush, but was definitely very delicious and would come back again. Everything was fried just right and very flavorful.","1056":"I'm going to write this review without excessive philosophizing, ranting or use of the \"I\" word. \u00c2\u00a0There will be no lengthy back story. \u00c2\u00a0I wouldn't be saying anything new anyway, since Selera Rasa has been on TV, blogged about and reviewed ad nauseum. \u00c2\u00a0Little wonder why, since this is arguably Singapore's best nasi lemak.Imagine a simple 3 ingredient high. \u00c2\u00a0The rich fragrance of basmati rice simmered and steamed in coconut milk and pandan leaves, the abrupt spicy heat of a sweet chili pepper coulis, and the savory comfort of a curry-fried chicken wing. \u00c2\u00a0There are other condiments, a fried egg, cucumber slices and ikan bills, the ubiquitous accompaniment to any self-respecting nasi lemak, but your brain is past caring about these other players on the plate and your eyes struggle to focus on what it is exactly that you've put in your mouth that still has you reeling. \u00c2\u00a0It's the triumvirate of chili, rice and curried chicken wing....trust me.I'd like to think I know a thing or two about nasi lemak, having had it just about every Saturday for tea since I was knee high to a cicak. \u00c2\u00a0So I think I speak with some personal authority on the matter of whether Selera Rasa is a worthy nasi lemak hall-of-famer. \u00c2\u00a0I think it is. \u00c2\u00a0I also think that Selera Rasa is a victim of it's own fame. All the media coverage creates unrealistic expectations in diners who flock here only to be disappointed when angels don't appear and next week's 4D numbers fail to materialize in the basmati. \u00c2\u00a0Don't expect too much, come with an open mind and set your senses free to explore and you will come away satisfied, if not pleasant surprised.It really is just honest to goodness solid quotidian fare. \u00c2\u00a0Look beyond the bull-@$!# that's been piled on these guys by the media and see it for the single specialty master hawker stall that it is and you'll see what all the fuss is about. \u00c2\u00a0It's just a local stall that serves good honest nasi lemak. \u00c2\u00a0No gimmicks. \u00c2\u00a0No fancy service. \u00c2\u00a0Just think of all the superlatives that pepper reviews of the latest French restaurant, Italian joint or Spanish tapas place; why don't those same superlatives apply here? \u00c2\u00a0Based on flavor alone, I see no reasonable explanation why not...unless it's the bull-@#$% these places are throwing in your eyes.Get real, get local, hug your local hawker today and tell him or her you love her. \u00c2\u00a0Creepy? Yes, but necessary, oooh so necessary!","1057":"My first time at this stall.Using basmati rice is not a bad idea, but it is too soft and sticky.Nasi Lemak's rice should be slightly more solid and separated.Sambal Chilli is excellent.","1058":"Adam Road Food Centre. This is another local only food place, but has been touted as the best in Singapore and I can understand why. I ordered the Full House. \u00c2\u00a0Includes rice (basmati rice), thick slice of cucumber, sambal sauce, fried chicken wing, otak otak (fish paste in banana leaf), ikan bilis (small dried fish) and a fried egg. Awesome!The key here is that they use Basmati rice. Makes a huge difference.","1059":"We did timing the queue, it takes almost an hour.Probably we came at the wrong timing, Sunday brunch time.I would like to say, you can taste coconut milk on the rice, which probably quite seldom in Singapore.Nice Sambal which not too spicy, with crispy chicken wing, fish, anchovies\/ikan bilis and otah.Now left with the queue, whether it worth or not is up to you, to me one hour queue probably not.","1060":"My parents and I used to come here every Saturday morning to have breakfast before the lines start snaking. I wouldn't go as far as saying that Selera has the best nasi lemak in Singapore, but it's pretty damn close. The Good: Basmati Rice. Begadil. Sweet & Spicy Sambal.The Bad: Long lines. Food is occasionally cold.The Ugly:People before you in line ordering 874893278932 packs of Nasi LemakCome here for a life changing experience, but be prepared to line up for a while before you get there.","1061":"We sought this place out because it was on the Food Network, and supposedly the sultan of Brunei visits this stall when he's in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0I think their main claim to fame is that they make their nasi lemak with basmati rice, which makes it a little bit lighter. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not sure that it's really that much better than any other nasi lemak I've had in Singapore, but it definitely is good. \u00c2\u00a0The rice is packed with aromatic coconut flavor, and the fried chicken wing that comes with the set was crispy and juicy. \u00c2\u00a0I'm also a big fan of their sambal; it's spicier than most, a little sweet, and not too salty.It's debatable whether this is truly food fit for royalty, but it's more than good enough for me.","1062":"To find this stall, follow the queue. Okay, maybe not quite. There are two famous nasi lemak stalls in Adam Road Food Centre, side by side. One of them is the first shop of the food centre, this one is the second. Ironically, I find that the better one is in second place. Fair enough as well, as Selera Rasa seems to be open longer hours than the other one does. Most of the time when you're there you ought to be prepared to queue up for a good twenty minutes, because many people come in line not just to order one plate, or two boxes, but a party-load of it. That just shows how good it is. The rice is always at such a good texture, though I find that its taste can be quite a hit and miss sometimes, and lacks that bit of coconut flavour to it. But Selera Rasa more than makes up for whatever's lacking with such good sambal chilli, so the rice becomes a little matter.The gold is in the chicken. The colour is so wonderfully golden, you only have to look at it to tell that it will be such a crispy treat. Inside the chicken is still so juicy and so tender, though a little oily, and it makes you wish you had more than one on your plate - which is why I always ask for two. The ikan bilis is very well fried, and as a personal bonus, don't come automatically with the nuts, as they usually tend to do, thus saving me all that time and effort in removing it.Word on the street is that the nasi lemak from this stall is one of President Tony Tan's favourite food...so 'nuff said I hope!","1063":"Suprisingly, using basmati rice for nasi lemak work quite well - it's not too separated as I expect like briyani and the coconut taste can still stand out. The sides is just ok for me you can choose between otah, bergedil, fried wing, fried fish, or egg with combo named just like in poker. Somehow I think the portion is too small for the price it charges.","1064":"I'm not so sure whats so special about this place (except that I confess the basmati rice makes it more fluffy) but I'm a sucker all the same","1065":"Came here per a friend's suggestion. After a short walk along the Henderson Waves, my date and I walked here for dinner and the view and ambiance was amazing. It was about 8:30pm, clear evening skies with the view of the city and the cable cars running.We had a rose wine and a mocktail, both of which were tasty. We shared a seafood pasta, which was good, but not the best. Taste was a bit on the bland side, but it was just one dish.Next time I'm in SG I would definitely come back. It's a great, casual, romantic spot for a date.","1066":"I'm pretty sure this place changed names to Dusk. Has tapas and other stuff including drinks to enjoy with an epic view. Service is very nice. Tip: get a membership with the faber group for unlimited cable car. Also give you discounts at shops and 20 percent off the bill which should pay for itself. I think going for 20sgd now. May be a promo.","1067":"I can be very short on this review. After having walked the entire day, we were warmly welcomed, got a table with an amazing view. The menu was a bit shortened due to holiday period, was there was still enough choice. We took the roasted chicken, which was one of the recommendations on Chope. And boy, they were right. The chicken was so tender, full of flavor and the sides just matched perfectly. Great diner, great views !!","1068":"I'm only rating this place 2 stars and not 1 because of the beautiful location and ambience.I ordered the tapas Thai green chicken curry served with rice crackers. I have to say, this has got to be the most awful \"curry\" I've ever had!The curry was served with minced meat, there was hardly any broth or curry of any sort. There was nothing curry about it, it was SOLID. To add to it, the whole thing was served with dry rice crackers with the overly salty minced meat titled \"green curry\".Overall, I have to say I'm REALLY disappointed. One of the worst meals ever.","1069":"The view was gorgeous, the hike was enjoyable, but the service was h.o.r.r.i.b.l.e. No one came to us when we waited to be seated for several minutes. After being seated, no one came to give us a menu, or ask for drinks for awhile. I'm talking at least ten minutes. It should also be noted there were less than 20 guests there, and roughly 5 waiters.After going up to a waiter and asking to be served, our drinks came at a nice speedy pace.... But we were given someone else's food. We then had to flag down a waiter again, and explain that this isn't what we ordered. Only once again to not get our food for awhile. During this, the line of guests waiting to be seated grew to at least 10 people, and no one was there to greet them.The food was mediocre, overpriced, and not worth the view.I'd recommend going up to Fabre point to see the city and the forests, but pack a lunch, because there's no point in eating here.","1070":"We were there on a Friday night and it seemed like a very family-friendly place - lots of kids running around. Might be better for a (fairly expensive) family outing than a date.Food was pretty good - we had the cod with soba and the pasta with clams in white wine sauce. 3 stars for the quality and maybe a bit more for the large portions! We couldn't finish.Ambience was a 2.5-3 star though - tables and chairs were made from poolside plastic and kind of tacky for the prices and setting. Kind of a confusing place. Maybe I'd go for brunch instead.","1071":"The view is absolutely gorgeous, over viewing the sparkling city of lights, the bay and the lovely island, and it's especially better at night. The decoration is very well done, with LED strips on the stairs, soft lighting in the roof, and a fake candle on each table. The restaurant is flexible to dietary requirements, but not all of them. The restaurant generally isn't too packed, and the atmosphere is great; quiet with good music playing in the background, and the air conditioning helps loads in the hot Singaporean heat. Also located next to the Bell or Happiness (look it up if you don't know what I'm talking about). The food was also pretty good quality for what we ordered. The Chilli Crab, whilst the chilli was mild, was ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING DELICIOUS! The chips were perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The beer and wine was good, but the wine glass could be bigger, but the wine is extremely expensive, one tiny glass is worth a whole bottle. The chicken wings were greasy, but otherwise enjoyable. On our night, a group of four were dancing to the music, not sure why, but they were. The service is quick, and efficient, so I was happy about that. I'd definitely recommend this place for a good night out, but be prepped for some expensive items, and some reasonable prices items.","1072":"We had dessert after walking and taking in the gorgeous views around the park.The restaurant itself has beautiful views as well. Service was nice and efficient. \u00c2\u00a0Our desserts were worth going back for.","1073":"Maybe it was from all the walking at Mount Faber, our lunch here was fantastic. This restaurant has floor to ceiling windows with excellent view of Sentosa and the islands.Spuds and Aprons serves an international menu but we decided to try the local dishes. Hokkien Noodle, Curry Chicken, and Singapore Laksa were delicious. Will recommend and come back again.","1074":"Great view! \u00c2\u00a0Starters were good, particularly the potato skins with chilly crab. The salads were also good. However, the linguini and mushrooms wasn't too great. The big issue here was fast service on starters, but exceptionally slow service on salads and pastas.","1075":"Reasonable pricing and pretty decent portions. Nice new addition amongst the coffee shops and hawker Centre. Bold venture in my opinion. They bring in a small range of tiong Bahru bakery's bread and have their own cakes. Their coffee menu is also pretty standard with reasonable price and size, great for the office crowd nearby who wants an upgrade from the local kopi. Had the ratatouille pasta, a vegetarian pasta with squash, cherry tomatoes \u00c2\u00a0and a veggie stock base \u00c2\u00a0 The pasta was surprisingly quite good! Liked their raspberry cheesecake too The coffee is also decently made with a decent size I see myself coming back to try the rest of the menu!","1076":"We have mixed feelings about this place: the string hoppers were good, the fish and coconut sambal was average.This place was a big disappointment. No selection of curries. The food trays are empty at 7:30 PM. So they scrapped what's left on the trays. No utensils or paper napkins or drinks.It's located in market place in little India which is a dirty and smelly part of Singapore. We have no plans of ever returning to this area of the island. It is sad that while having a sizable south Asian population, Singapore also has an underclass with no clean and good restaurants to serve the Sri Lankan community.","1077":"Service is taking way too long. We are still waiting for our food even thought we have seated for 30 minutes. Granted there's about 50 of us :-)Update (2 hours later):The food came out just after I completed the first paragraph! Gado-gado, tauhu telur, fried chicken, acar fish, rendang and white rice. Everything was v good. Well the gado-gado and rendang were the weakest links but even then they were slightly above average. Delicious lunch. Note - didn't pay directly so not sure whether it was good value","1078":"A very disappointing meal. The ingredients were not fresh or of high quality. The tangy spice of Indonesian food in Indonesia was completely missing.","1079":"Authentic Indonesian food since 1981. My Family favorites include the flavorful rendang, fluffy tahu telor, perfectly fried Ikan Nila, and the desserts are to die for! Freshly squeezed coconut milk with fragrant gula Melaka.","1080":"I get nostalgic when I come to this outlet for a meal, it has been around for a longgg time, I remember coming here with my family maybe more than 10 or 15 years ago.The menu is classic Indonesian dishes - tahu telor is a perennial favourite and so is the rendang. My typical disappointment-proof dishes to order and share is the sambal kangkong (enough to share among 4 people), tahu telor and the fried fish (deliciously fresh!)The only letdown is that they don't serve sweet & sour fish anymore, that used to be my favourite dish growing up! Perhaps it wasn't very Indonesian, they realized? I don't know.Final verdict: Good old reliable restaurant for a satisfying Indonesian feast.","1081":"Good Indonesian food - favs include tahu telor, gado gado, Kang kong belacan, Ayam goreng. Nasi Kuning is yum too. Think the standard of food at this decades old location is better than Paragon, and the service too ! However, my favourite place for Indonesian food in Singapore remains Pagi Sore. This is a solid #2 though :)","1082":"Another great place to find truly authentic Indonesian Cuisine. One of the few Indonesian restaurants in Singapore to serve the famous Tahu Telor which is basically a deepfried tower of eggs and tofu topped with a sweet-spicy dark sauce. The texture is one that is both crispy and soft. Another crowd favorite at Tambuah Mas would be their signature Chendol with fresh green bean jelly and palm sugar, the perfect way to end your Indonesian meal experience!","1083":"Hold the phone, I haven't reviewed this place yet? The rotisserie is my go to spot for a quick and hearty take away lunch when I don't want to brave the crowds of Raffles Place looking for a place to sit or if I want to eat at my desk. The line can be long at times but moves quickly. The staff are fast and friendly. The food is good. A quarter chicken and your choice of 3 veggies or two salads for $12, nice! They have grab and go salads and wraps for around $9 each. So glad this spot is right downstairs. Big hug!","1084":"Coming from LA, I was a bit skeptical about eating here because the gyu kaku in LA isn't so good. Cheap, okay quality meat. Upon coming here, I was extremely surprised to see a totally upgraded menu with good quality meats and a variety of dishes. Ordered so much for four people, we could barely finish everything. Australian wgayu platter $230- rib eye, rump cap, sirloin, tongue, etc... Everything was amazing. Melt in your mouth goodness. So much fat and tenderness and flavor...Japanese A3 wgayu- surprisingly not as tender as the Australian. Maybe because it's a3? Still extremely tender though, and more flavor. I actually liked this one better. Seafood platter- pretty full by this point. Comes with giant prawns, scallops, salmon, oysters. It was decent, the prawn was the best. Maybe it wasn't as good because I was already extremely full?Also got the banchan, mushrooms, fried rice, and ice cream to top off the meal. All great compliments to the meal. Overall, best gyu kaku meal I've had. Everything was top notch quality, and it's really difficult to find this type of quality in la. Yum. I am salivating thinking about this meal. Definitely giving gyu kaku in other countries a chance!","1085":"Imported Japanese wagyu self-grilled over charcoal. Various cuts of fresh meat are available. In contrast to over-marinated kbbq, yakiniku are unseasoned, thus you can taste the quality of a good cut of meat easily. A good dish to start is the 190g trial platter, which consist of an array of meat cuts. Also worth mentioning was the extremely fragrant garlic fried rice, as well as the juicy kurobuta belly. I would recommend a reservation as the place gets filled fast on Friday\/Saturday nights. Definitely worth the occasional splurge.","1086":"It is difficult to believe this is a chain restaurant.If you do not like meat, you might not like Gyu Kaku.Japanese BBQ.If you do like meat, you will probably like Gyu Kaku Japanese BBQ.I love meat, so I love Gyu Kaku Japanese BBQ.The ambiance is nice. \u00c2\u00a0It is dark. \u00c2\u00a0it is not extravagant but it does have a classic touch to the space.In general, I am a fan of places where you are eating and cooking. This was just a meat-fest; sausage, beef, lamb, pork belly, tongue and more. \u00c2\u00a0 It was all \u00c2\u00a0there. \u00c2\u00a0It was all very good.tinyurl.com\/8bwahbstinyurl.com\/8dt35rxThere was kimchi, a small cucumber dish and a spinach salad. \u00c2\u00a0 I am not a huge kimchi fan but this was pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0The spinach salad was very good.tinyurl.com\/8k4ysk4tinyurl.com\/94vybk9tinyurl.com\/8bpjyd8The fried rice was AAA. \u00c2\u00a0It was fried table-side.tinyurl.com\/9nggnbjThere was even a little sorbet for dessert.tinyurl.com\/8gker2uThe service was friendly and helpful \u00c2\u00a0They changed the grill cover often. \u00c2\u00a0They were very willing to answer questions and they checked in frequently.I will definitely return and would not hesitate to try their other outlets in other locations local and abroad.","1087":"Good food, great service and lots of fun, Gyu Kaku is a nice place to have gatherings and enjoy food. Promising an authentic teppanyaki experience, which they pulled off with gusto, Gyu Kaku prides itself on the excellent service together with the freshest ingredients. The wagyu beef is absolutely juicy and well marbled and grilled to perfection. They do a pretty good job with the greens as well, providing a fresh tasting accompaniment to the meats. The ambience was great and though its great for gatherings with large groups of friends (I was there with 6 others), I spotted more couples than groups, which is oddly surprising as I don't find it really romantic.","1088":"I was leaving Chijmes with a friend after a business meeting when we walked by this restaurant. Feeling like Japanese BBQ, we decided to have dinner here. It was an authentic Teppanyaki, albeit pricy, meal. The meats were juicy and so, so fresh. If you're here, try the aburi bacon. Don't leave the veggies sidelined; the assorted mushrooms with butter were my favourite accompaniment to the meaty selection. Not much of a chef? Don't worry, they recommend combinations of seasoning for your food. Everything I had went well with Asahi. Service was great, as is usually expected from Japanese culture. The ambience was nice too. We ended up staying there for almost three hours, just the two of us. I'm definitely coming back here, perhaps this time with my foodie family.","1089":"My coworkers and I (3 of us total) just had dinner at Gyu Kaku. and I would like to report that we all had a very enjoyable meal.I have visited the Chicago location of Gyu Kaku on MANY occasions (10+) when working there - so I had high expectations of this place before coming in to the Singapore location.Based on the menu, our party ordered the Fuku Set and were pleased with it. As choice of salad, we requested the Wakame (Seaweed) Salad. All of our cuts of meat, Aburi Bacon, Wagyu Fillet Steak, Wagyu Karubi, Wagyu Rump Cap, Kurobuta Pork Collar, Duck Breast - were well marinated and delicious.The highlights for me would definitely be:- Wagyu Fillet Steak- Duck Breast- Wagyu KarubiThe service was good - offering to mix the rice for us, sort salads and change the grill. This is consistent with the level of service I've found at the Chicago location. I would definitely try to make it back here before I leave Singapore.","1090":"Last week I went to Gyu-Kaku at Chijmes for the first time, and it was a great experience!We ordered the premium platter that comes with a variety of different wagyu beef parts. We also ordered more plates of wagyu beef, pork belly and chicken. A waitress took the initiative to barbecue everything for us! Everything was cooked perfectly. When I bit into the beef it was slightly charred on the outside but sooo tender on the inside, bursting with beef juices.It was also my first time eating beef tongue, and it was quite delicious!! I'm not sure if that's because it is wagyu beef, but it tasted so juicy and flavorful and tongue-like actually...but maybe that's psychological.Also, the kimchi soup was the best kimchi soup I've ever had!!!! It's really delicious and a must-try if you love spicy food!! It wasn't too sour like how kimchi usually is, it was more sweet and was served piping hot!I guess the only downside is that it is quite expensive, but honestly you are paying for what you get! If you really have the money to splurge then it is worth it, especially if you like beef.Great ambience, great service and great food!! Overall for 5 people the bill came up to more than $500.Check out my blog (in my profile) for photos :)","1091":"This is the price that I am willing to pay for some good authentic Japanese barbeque! If you like Japanese barbeque, you will fall in love with this place. I love the beef here. Juicy, succulent, fresh and tender! The pork is equally good, with many parts of the pig to choose from. Out of curiosity, I also tried the beef tongue. They have a special dip to get rid of the 'bad smell', if any. The texture was pretty special, but the taste wasn't too very outstanding. One thing to note, the price is actually not very friendly to your pocket. It'd probably burn a hole! But for the good food you are paying, outstanding service and environment, I guess it's okay to be nice to yourself occasionally.","1092":"very nice, delicious food but light on the volume..if you are really hungry plan on spending alot. \u00c2\u00a0Also the staff's English (fairly) wasn't that great so expect a bit of back and forth, but worth it for the quality","1093":"They have a pretty simple menu. Everything is reasonably priced. I had the Bak Kut Teh and Watercress Soup. Both were very tasty. Service is good. They're conveniently located in the basement level of a shopping mall. Most importantly, the restaurant was very clean!","1094":"Great food. \u00c2\u00a0Nice staff. There is Indian, \u00c2\u00a0Chinese, \u00c2\u00a0Thai, Western and more. \u00c2\u00a0There is also beer and coffee. \u00c2\u00a0Most meals are cheap and lots of choice in the $3-$5 range which for lunch suits me. \u00c2\u00a0Hi turn over means food is fresh.","1095":"Good food selection. Plenty of seating. Great place for a quick bite.","1096":"B.R.E.A.M. Burgers rule everything around me. My love affair with Burger Joint goes back to the early naughties when I was waiting in line at the Parker Meridian lobby in NYC to enter a velvet shrouded dive bar. The feeling hasn't changed, but the beers have gotten better. Burgers...top notch for Singapore. Beer...amount the best selection of craft brews in the city. Plus, open till laaaaaaaaate. Go here, or live unhappy.","1097":"A VERY good Burger, an EXTREMELY deep Tap List, but at what price? True, their burger meat is flown in straight from Nebraska and never frozen. True, they have Prairie and Perennial Artisan Ales, Evil Twin, and Superstition Meadery on-Tap, but a 100+ SGD tab? Not worth it. What really bothered me with my experience was the price I was charged for a Perennial- Til the Night Closes In.. 35 SGD for a Half Pint pour! When checking the Tap List price on Untappd, it shows 22 SGD for a Half Pint Pour. Not cool! I could have gone back to get either another half pour of this Stout or brought it up to a Manager but didn't have time before heading home. My Bacon, Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o Burger also didn't come with \"The Works\" but it took 45min to receive my burger so didn't want to wait any longer. Mind you, when your order is ready, they yell out the Order # MULTIPLE times at a high pitched decibel. They need a better system than this. Decent place but I'm sure there are PLENTY of other beer bars and burger joints I could have hit that would have had better customer service and not ripped me off..","1098":"Just another over priced burger in Singapore. Nothing special about this place. Service not great I sat at bar for 7 mins before anyone asked me if I wanted anything , and I was one of 3 people sitting at bar. Beef obviously frozen not fresh. Super market \u00c2\u00a0has better beef \u00c2\u00a0, medium rare means juicy pink Center. Not Gray mushy. I won't be back.","1099":"It's good, BUT not as good as any freshly grilled burger you would get at a US resort poolside, just doesn't have that unique grilled flavor. Seems they directly import 80\/20 USDA Beef, (80% beef, 20% fat), mission critical for the juicy output. Grey Poupon mustard, a +. It is expensive, all in S$20.95 for just a Cheeseburger, bar served me a cold 'sky juice' for free, (and I would have screamed bloody mercy if they hadn't). And to their credit, it wasn't tap water. Very convenient to Telok Ayer DT Line. I'm not a fries fan, so passed on those as well as a $4 bottle of Dasani! Landlords victor again, damned our Singapore Inc. is expensive.","1100":"Decent burgers hidden from view along Gemmill Lane.The address may state Amoy street, but you should enter via Gemmill Lane. The Singapore edition of Burger Joint attempts to recreate that greasy, divey, hole in the wall NYC experience with a hidden entrance, with only a neon burger sign pointing the way. The interior is also decorated similar to the New York outlet.I found the burgers OK, with the ingredients fresh, the patty suitably juicy and with the necessary toppings but still lacking that distinctive taste. S$25 for a double cheeseburger is also a bit expensive. I also got the boozy (baileys) shake, which was rather thin and arrived in a small cup that set me back S$15.This place has been open less than a week and I think that they still need to get their operations ironed out. The line was extremely long, but not well managed. The trash cans were located near the front of the line, causing people to mill about and add to the crowd at the counter. It took a good 20 mins or more to receive my burger and shake.Overall, it's ok if you're coming in late in the evening, without the wait. But otherwise it's not worth squeezing with the hungry hordes to get your burger.(Full disclosure, I've not yet been to the actual NY outlet, but I'm comparing it with other burgers that I've had on the West Coast such as Umami, Super Duper, Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out.)","1101":"$33 for a small burger, coke and fries... You have to be kidding me!Expensive and nothing special. Would I return? Yes, under 1 of the 3 conditions below 1) I am kidnapped by the Vietnamese mafia and brought here against my will,,, and they are paying2) This is the last burger joint in the world and my life depended on eating this tiny burger.3) There was a financial crash and this was the only place now taking my worthless SGD","1102":"These are the best burgers in Singapore, hands down. The selection of beers is also fantastic, and the bartenders know the ever changing beer selection well enough to make a recommendation.","1103":"The burger joint has come toSingapore and while it in some ways is better than the original (good selection of beers!) it is worse in other ways (longer lines and worse value for money). It has stayed true to the original in the way that it is sort of half hidden, in this case in a back alley with the characteristic burger sign guiding you to its location. The place is fairly big and while slightly chaotic with orders being accepted at the food counter and then beer orders at the bar (but if you're lucky or ask nicely they may accept your food order there as well). The burgers are very good and to me are at the same quality level as the original burger joint and the beers are also excellent. What is however my main objection is the price level - count on 30+ SGD for a meal and easily well above 40 if you want beer and anything other than a basic small burger and fries. Still the prices are clearly displayed so just a matter of deciding whether worth it. It is one of the better burgers in Singapore so I will probably try it now and then.","1104":"Nice location with a decent burger but overpriced and worse of all, has ketchup by default.You can ask to have it without but I expect good locations to not offer it by default.Also note: this is the same joint as the one in le Meridien hotel in NYC","1105":"Burger Joint is like a speakeasy but for burgers. \u00c2\u00a0Although the address is Amoy Street, you need to go behind the alley (Gemmill Lane) access the place and behind a metal door. \u00c2\u00a0But once inside, you will be rewarded by one of the tastiest burgers on the island! \u00c2\u00a0 Burger Joint is actually an outpost of the original which is also quite hidden at the Le Parker Meridien in NYC. \u00c2\u00a0There were 3 things I thought that really set this burger apart from the crowd: 1). The beef - US beef, good texture and flavor, and 2). Real American cheese, melted and gooey; and 3). A bun that doesn't dissolve - sorry I really can't stand all of the burger joints that use a brioche. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the works, which was a bit messy but totally worth it. \u00c2\u00a0It's a bit pricey - about $32 for burger, fries and a soda, but that seems to be the going rate around here. \u00c2\u00a0And actually, it does double as a true speakeasy, as they have a well-stocked bar with a decent whiskey selection and craft beers. \u00c2\u00a0As I am in the area quite frequently for bar hopping, it's nice to also find a great burger place as well. \u00c2\u00a0Amoy Street keeps getting better and better!","1106":"Would not have found this place if my friend wasnt with me. Back alleyway, with no sign on the door. However, if you bother actually looking and once you found it, you are in for a treat. Once through the door, you see heavy curtains blocking off a side of a restaurant and leading you to the area where you are to order your food. According to my friend - menu is what you usually get in the US, with the basic burger and add ons. This was after work on a Friday (meaning I get off work slighly earlier) and the place was fairly packed. You order at the counter and you collect the paper bags of food at the counter and there are tables. Burger was slighly smaller than what I expected it to be but it tasted good. Fries were decent. It comes with a price tag though - for a burger that size, I paid $19? Soft drinks were about $4.50-5.00. Not the cheapest, but heck, they do a decent burger.","1107":"Quite tasty burger. Fries were perfect (great size, texture, and salt). The milk shake was crap. If you are going to play up the whole New York burger joint thing, at least get some good whole milk to make your shakes from the same cows in Nebraska you claim to get your meat.Also, we all had to painfully watch the OCD bartender change the font of the beer blackboard menu throughout our meal. All the patrons were looking at each other, exchanging glances like \"WTF, this is so strange\". Also, you shouldn't have your employees drinking on the job sitting AT the bar.","1108":"Stellar burgers, with the works, S$18 each. \u00c2\u00a0Perfectly cooked fries, S$5.50. \u00c2\u00a0All too small soda, S$4.50. \u00c2\u00a0Served in a paper bag, walls covered in deliberate graffiti.Spendy but worth it.","1109":"Eff Yes!!!! Freaking love this place, exactly the type of place I used to frequent in Cali. Man they have a board of rotating craft beer on tap from all parts of the US, ranging from a vast selection of IPAs, lagers and even some porters.The best part, knowledgeable bartenders. It's a huge deal for me to be able to geek out and talk beer with people working at the bar. It's a big plus. I'm only reviewing the beer. I will review the burgers next time. I'm definitely coming back to this gem!","1110":"Don't miss the nondescript entrance in the alley off Amoy Street. Legit burger joint meets tap house \/ bourbon bar. Hi quality beef - blows Berg's out of the water. This place could easily stand on it's own in NYC. The only catch is the eye watering prices. $35 double with fries and a $25 Stone Brewery draft. Wait, I just spent $60 on a burger and beer? Still, cheaper than a plane ticket back Stateside.","1111":"My burger was not seasoned (i.e., it didn't taste like anything), it wasn't cooked to order (I asked for medium and got rare), it was TINY, and really expensive. Total waste of money.","1112":"It's the Super Duper Burger of Singapore. Yummy and no fuss. The beer and whiskey selections are good for a quick dive in for a meal. Worth the time and money.","1113":"Another Breadtalk concept which poshes up the old kopitiam cafe concept. There's hipster tisanes and brew coffees to go with your chicken rice and chicken curry. Clever twists on presentation. The chicken curry comes in a bread bowl. The Raffles blend coffee is a filter coffee that comes with a mini sock in a fancy glass filter. The desserts are all plated with fancy finesse - think sauces brushed on plates, quenelles of ice creams, strategically placed fruits. Despite the hipster presentation, the food is nicely done. The chicken rice has silky chicken and good broth. The chicken curry has good rempah but the bread bowl is huge. Prices are of course on the high side to match the table service and fancy ambience. But it's a nice quiet corner to hang out for dinner and coffee.","1114":"1933 is a cafe which is opened by BreadTalk. To most, it feels like an atas version of ToastBox. The cafe offers local cuisine, priced reasonable, considering the high class shopping mall.Tea Set ($10.90++)The cafe offers a reasonable priced tea set during the afternoon. It is pandan chiffon cake served with a choice of tea or coffee.

If not enough, there's a serving of rich Gula Melaka syrup to dip with. The cake was light and fluffy. Although it looked like there was lots of cream with dessicated coconut on top of the cake, I felt that it gave the cake a kind of moist feel.Served with Green Mango Peach fruit tea \u00e6\u009c\u0089\u00e6\u009c\u00ba\u00e8\u008a\u0092\u00e6\u009e\u009c\u00e6\u00a1\u0083\u00e5\u0091\u00b3\u00e8\u008c\u00b6 ($8)The tea was light and fruity in taste.Overall the tea set was enjoyable. The service was great with the staff refilling the tea without being asked to.","1115":"Nice air-conditioned environment within the Capitol Piazza overlooking the Atrium. Try the Asian fusion baked goods (on display the front) and the Eggs Royale - the smoothies have no added sugar. Nice and quiet during brunch. Lunch menu starts at 11:30am and yes there's chicken rice if you need it.It's not big, it doesn't try to be too clever, and gets the job done nicely!","1116":"Boy had a craving for Dan Dan mian so happen to find this place so we decide to give it a try and got to say it was good on most of the dishes. \u00c2\u00a0To start with the Dan Dan was nice though strangely we prefer what we had in yokohama. \u00c2\u00a0The garlic with pork though strong in garlic taste was great. \u00c2\u00a0The beef in chili oil was tender and not over spicey.

Visit it for a mouth numbing experience, from starters to mains and even vegetables start to stop feeling your mouth and tonsils.We let the chef decide what to serve and had a beautiful red spread with just the right servings for 5.Some of the must order dishes:The chilled cucumber is very good with the sweet soy sauce flavor nicely absorbed then the heat from the chili oil coating it. So it will be spicy at first then slowly get sweet.The fish in chili oil had large quantities of perfectly marinated and executed dory fish that made frozen fish taste so sweet it almost seemed fresh.Lastly the star is the la zi ji, which is deep fried chicken fried with dried chili. The deep fried chicken had nicely soaked up the fragrance from the chili, yet did not turn oily!","1119":"Had the wasabi prawns, per the server's recommendation. \u00c2\u00a0Utterly fantastic! \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps the best Chinese food I have had in my life -- including lots of my China trip! \u00c2\u00a0(Ok, the Peking Duck I had in Bejing was over the top). \u00c2\u00a0Highly recommended.","1120":"We first went to Silk Road in 2007 and it was really good, both for business lunches and family dinners.

We ordered the award winning pumpkin broth with scallop, fish maw and sharksfin, cod fish with deep fried soya crumbs, french beans with minced meat, roasted Beijing duck and spring onion pancake.Everything was terribly disappointing and nothing like what I remembered having before. The food didn't even arrive hot! Standards have dropped abysmally. It's a realy pity because the restaurant is gorgeous and the service is decent. Will not be back.","1121":"After living in Thailand for 5 years, my biggest concern moving back to Singapore was finding GOOD THAI FOOD! \u00c2\u00a0After trying the Thai Chains and other restaurants (and being disappointed), I came across E-Sarn Thai Cuisine at Thomson Ridge.The dishes there make me feel like eating in Thailand. \u00c2\u00a0You must try the Khao-soi, Basil Chicken, Tom Yam and Thai Iced Tea.I'm now a regular!","1122":"Authentic Northeastern Thai cuisine. Pretty authentic food - had the pork basil rice and som tum (Thai papaya salad). Both are good \/ authentic","1123":"Great little place for food at the design museum! Unbeatable prices for happy hour oysters and really delicious food! The restaurant has more of a cafe setting and is set right next to the hip museum store. The oysters are $2 each with every drink ordered, up to 6 maximum per person. I wasn't expecting much from the oysters but it's surprisingly really huge and sweet. The vinegar and lemon is very good for enhancing the flavour.I also really liked the honey alcohol drink and food at Tanuki raw. The salted egg yolk runny egg and Cha Shu rice was v delicious. So was the truffle beef rice with runny egg! We also had salted egg yolk fries and it was very delicious. The service was reasonable, not too attentive but not annoyingly ignorant. I definitely would visit again! The place is a hidden gem so not many people visit and there's no wait for seats!","1124":"Decently priced on the more high end trend side. It is located within a store, which is a really neat concept as I wish more places did that. The food is generally very flavorful and attracts the young, hip, crowd. The building it is incased in is called the National Design Centre.I believe the building is a office building for businesses in the creative sector. It also houses a few shops on the ground floor and the Tanuki Raw restaurant.A must: truffle friesI think would just come back for the truffle fries to be honesthaha I liked it better than my entree which was a beef bowl with an egg ontop it. And I haven't had such good truffle fries since.Places of interest include: FarmStore Singapore, Basheer Graphic Books, When I was Four, and Objectifs Gallery.","1125":"New outpost of Tanuki Raw while the previously outlet is awaiting the revamp at Orchard central. I've not tasted much of the menu unfortunately; it's usually a quick bite stop here for me. So it's the Beef bowl. Slices of tender medium cooked beef, onsen egg and that yummy Tanuki mixed rice. Sprinkled with truffle oil. Instant fuel! You can opt to go all the way to 11 with the foie gras topped version.","1126":"Great place to chill with the interesting drinks and good coffee! :) Service staff were polite and quick to serve on a busy Saturday afternoon. Did not try the food at this outlet so I can't comment this time, but will be back for more! It was nice to have water and glasses on each table","1127":"Got their angus beef and foie gras truffle yakiniku - it's great!!! Had it ordered and delivered via ubereats; extremely happy with the food. The yakiniku came with an onsen egg and the foie gras was nicely done The rice my favorite \u00c2\u00a0part was seasoned and flavored which was the best part! Looking forward to trying it sizzling hot at the restaurant itself someday !","1128":"I've always liked food concepts like Tanuki Raw. With the flavours & combinations, you can't really go wrong. Had the beef bowl & foie. Like I said with the flavours & quality of ingredients, you can't really go wrong. I was happy with the Foie, big portion, cooked well and packed with flavour. The beef was tasty but when you order it with the foie, they GIVE SO LITTLE!!! Which didn't make sense! Because if I paid more it should be a add-on not a way to balance the portions? The rice was a little dry. The batch I had was not cooked well in my opinion but luckily it had all the other stuff to make it decent. I didn't like the Ginger Lemonade. For the size of the glass (and price!), it should really be done better. It lacked balance and the ginger was so overpowering that I felt like I ordered a spicy ginger drink! I could hardly taste the lemonade. I had to add water & squeeze the lemon wedge to balance the flavour. Menu options sounded good. I'd come back to try the other dishes.","1129":"Realistic Mexican food served here. \u00c2\u00a0A nice place to come for a home-sick Californian needing some comida Mexicana. \u00c2\u00a0Good variety of food, refried beans could be better but it's ok. \u00c2\u00a0This location at Dempsey Hill and atmosphere is very nice, always enjoy it here. \u00c2\u00a0A little pricey but it is Singapore after all.  But I always drink Tiger beer, not Corona.","1130":"Walking into the restaurant it seemed unusually empty, during prime time. Ordering fajitas sounded like a great idea, the meat was tender and juicy, whilst the tortillas were bland and definitely not home made. The side of guac and chips were a pleasant surprise, perhaps it was because we were all just starving, therefore we devoured the serving. The serving sizes are way to small and that's the disappointment. Margaritas has a great potential to make good food, today that just wasn't the case.","1131":"Having spent a lot of time in Mexico, I found it a bit curious to be eating \u00c2\u00a0Mexican food in Singapore but, my team was flying off so there we were. It was like being in Mexico except in Singapore. The fajitas was delicious, I love their margarita presentation (basically served in a bottle of patron) and their chips and other dishes were pretty good. It's pricey though..esp for Mexican food but hey, if you're in Singapore and you have a craving for Mexican food, this place is spot on.","1132":"Hands down the best Mexican I've had in Singapore! Every single dish is great, especially their hot pan beef fajitas, beyond words! Felt like I went on to heaven and came back to margarita's... the first bite of beef was incredible (eat it with the onion). AMAZING. Had their chicken enchiladas, was a 4star for me compared to the general ones out there. Also had the best nachos here (the one with black beans and guacamole). Ordered a virgin mojito, can't go wrong with that. the concoction was balanced and perfect for if you find the green chilli spicy. Their spice level is very manageable relative to other Mexican restaurants. Will definitely come back again and again :)","1133":"Had dinner with friends here a couple of nights ago. I had been here ages ago and didn't have a good impression but I was pleasantly surprised this time.We ordered a pitcher of tamarind margaritas, which was refreshing. We had nachos with melted cheese, with a hint of chili. It was warm, tasty and a good portion \u00c2\u00a0for 3-4 people. The chicken taco salad was OK, \u00c2\u00a0but the Christmas special menu item crab au gratin was delicious. It came with tortilla and a sauce that tasted like olives. For dessert we had toffee pudding with chili. It was good. Service was friendly and fast. I don't think that this is authentic Mexican food. It's more Tex-Mex. Still enjoyable though, with a nice ambience.","1134":"Have been so many times and will continue to go back. \u00c2\u00a0Greatest Mexican food I can find in Singapore.","1135":"Had heard a lot of good things about this place but the food sadly didn't live up to expectations. Had the nachos which were not that bad. My main course was the lime chicken with chipotle sauce. The sauce and the accompanying rice and beans were fine but the chicken was too rubbery.","1136":"Probably the best Mexican food in Singapore but the best thing about it is that they have gluten free options.","1137":"Sometimes I eat here and the food is great, however last time I ate there I got sick. I had the chimichangas and was rushed to the toilet moments later. Tried to tell them it was far too greasy and not looking so great however they did not offer to make again or have discount. Their margarita pitchers are a great choice if you are having a large group together though. And their fajitas are a good choice. Also good menu for children.","1138":"This is probably the worst service I've had at any place I've eaten at in Singapore. Poor service and horrible queso are not going to bring me back any time soon. Won't be coming back ever!","1139":"This is a review of a dinner date at Margarita's at Dempsey Hill.My date had an evening class. \u00c2\u00a0We first met at Crystal Jade in Holland Village. \u00c2\u00a0But they were too busy. \u00c2\u00a0It was already beyond 10. \u00c2\u00a0We decided to just go to Dempsey and pick a place.tinyurl.com\/b9cl5fuShe suggested La Salsa. \u00c2\u00a0But I've already been there. \u00c2\u00a0I knew Margarita's was close by and countered with it.When we arrived, we were told that we had to order ASAP. \u00c2\u00a0They were closing soon and this was the last round of orders. \u00c2\u00a0They meant this too. \u00c2\u00a0Just after we were seated, they were at our table and it was clear they wanted us to order. \u00c2\u00a0I believe restaurants should either be open or they should be closed. Throughout our meal, the staff was friendly but rushed. \u00c2\u00a0For this, I have deducted one star from their overall review.The ambiance is great. I actually really liked the room. \u00c2\u00a0It has very high ceilings. The earthen tones make for a warm inviting environment. \u00c2\u00a0There are lots of paintings on the wall. \u00c2\u00a0It would be a great space for a party.tinyurl.com\/bayzxalWe each ordered a cocktail. \u00c2\u00a0I had a frozen lime margarita. \u00c2\u00a0She had a frozen strawberry daiquiri. \u00c2\u00a0My margarita was a tad on the bitter side. \u00c2\u00a0Outside of that, it reminded me of a margarita made with basic margarita mix.tinyurl.com\/bx6ezg6tinyurl.com\/as8a663The food was average to relatively good.Chicken Fajitas - \u00c2\u00a0I could almost cut and paste my review of the steak fajitas from La Salsa. \u00c2\u00a0They were very generous with the chicken. \u00c2\u00a0It did come on a sizzling platter. \u00c2\u00a0The seasoning seemed like something straight out of pre-made spice mix. \u00c2\u00a0They were not nearly as generous with the condiments. \u00c2\u00a0Plus, these also appeared to be straight out of cans, jars, or bottles. \u00c2\u00a0The guacamole had no texture to it. \u00c2\u00a0The salsa was no better that Tostito's. \u00c2\u00a0They did not provide beans or rice. \u00c2\u00a0If you are going to charge $30+ for chicken fajitas, they should darn well come with beans and rice. \u00c2\u00a0The tortillas were well heated.In the end, these were decent fajitas. \u00c2\u00a0If the salsa and guacamole had been better, it could have made a big difference. tinyurl.com\/a6h7mohCondiments:tinyurl.com\/balvrr8Margarita Chicken - My dinner date ordered their Margarita Chicken. \u00c2\u00a0I did not try it. \u00c2\u00a0The dish look pretty appetizing. \u00c2\u00a0She enjoyed it.tinyurl.com\/aqqova8Receipt (Dinner for 2 - $110.64):tinyurl.com\/b5us2cfOverall - Rushed service led to a rushed dining experience. \u00c2\u00a0Nice spacious room. \u00c2\u00a0Large US chain-level quality Tex-Mex food. \u00c2\u00a0If you really have a hankerin' for some Tex-Mex or pseudo Mexican food, they will do. \u00c2\u00a0So you do not get rushed out the door, I suggest going well before 10 pm.","1140":"This restaurant is located at Dempsey Hills and there are a few Mexican Restaurants nearby so it is easily missed.Arrived around 6.30 pm on a Thursday night. Parking was alright as there were still empty spots when I arrived. It will be more crowded around 7pm on weekdays and no doubt on weekends.It is my first time eating at a Mexican Restaurant in Singapore so I can't really compare yet (more reviews for the ones in California).When My aunt and I stepped indoor, there were reserved signs on most table. The servers did not really hear us out on wanting the indoor seat and had to repeat ourselves for three times before they gave us a corner table for two.Looking at the menu, there were a range of choices. I looked into the burrito section and spotted beef chimichanga. My aunt ordered something else.For drinks, I had a strawberry jarritos. Missed this soda ever since I stepped in Singapore. The food came 15 minutes later and came in a big portion. I was amazed at the portion and expected a smaller portion for a huge price ($18). The tortilla outside was crispy. The black bean with cheese was delicious but there are too much chunks of shredded beef. On my plate there was a side of rice and a side of cabbage\/lettuce. The portion is too big for the taste. I would prefer less meat to savor the sour cream and the avocado instead. (1\/2 star deducted here).We called for checks and it came to a more shocking amount. 7% gst, 10% service charge. In the end two meals, two drinks added up around $70+. I think that they need to cut down the price. (This is why 1\/2 star is deducted).Overall it is alright to go there once awhile. But since there was no other reviews i was not sure what's good here.","1141":"First time I can remember having good tasting Mexican food in Asia. \u00c2\u00a0Certain one nothing like this in Hong Kong and I haven't found anything close in Singapore until now. Guacamole was great. Enjoyed the Chicken burrito, very nice presentation, as well as the red snapper my wife had. Probably my favorite was the tortilla soup, really tasty. As could be expected in this location, Dempsey Hill, it's pricey, but worth it for something this good in Singapore.","1142":"Very interesting place..nice set up and ambience and we were pleasantly surprised to find oysters in this place. The enchiladas and quesadillas were pretty good and so were the desserts - tiramisu..however they close fairly early at 10:30 pm!","1143":"Recently refurbished, it has a nice feel, sat at the bar and had margaritas, great service, nachos and salsa really good, got a table for dinner and had the beef tacos which were excellent, mixed fajitas really tasty, an excellent evening, great place and great Mexican food","1144":"An upscale version of Chipotle, in terms of quality and portion (well unless you've mastered the skill of maximizing your burrito bowl :P) I would recommend this restaurant if you're dining with a party of 3+ so you can share and enjoy the various Mexican dishes Magarita's offers. Some of my personal favorites are the taco salad that comes with generous amounts of chicken, veggies, cheese, and kidney beans (though it seems like they've cut back on the amount of black beans served in return) and the US prime rib, which is very tender and well marinated. The crab meat quesadilla is mediocre; there was too much cheese and scarce amounts of crab.","1145":"Heard a lot about this place and decided to give it a try \u00c2\u00a0 Being from California in USA, I am always looking for good Margaritas and Mexican food. \u00c2\u00a0Well, good blended Margaritas.....they should be for the price $76 for a pitcher that serves about 6 small glasses. \u00c2\u00a0After ordering drinks, my pocketbook had a hard time opening wider to order food, so ordered chips & salsa and cheese taquitos. \u00c2\u00a0The salsa was okay and fixed up to taste authentic, but definitely from a can and chips were warm and tasty. \u00c2\u00a0The taquitos were good and covered in tasty salsa w\/ dollops of sour cream & guacamole.The atmosphere was pleasant and inviting. \u00c2\u00a0The music started off with Latin music, but over time got mixed up w\/ Caribbean steel drum. \u00c2\u00a0The wait staff was attentive and pleasant. \u00c2\u00a0The extra star is for them.All in all pleasant experience.","1146":"Mesmerizing ambiance. Food, nothing worth reviewing except being over-priced like many things in S'PoreMargaritas are good though!!!","1147":"Now usually the quality of mexican food here would be super a-okay and nothing to rave about - however, having tried mexican at a few other places where it was AWFUL - this is place is pretty good for a mexican joint in Singapore. I had the veggie enchilada dish and I was not dissapointed with the serving size. Both of my friends got meat dishes that had large portions as well, so we were all really happy about it. Overall, food was good. Not amazing, but you leave satisfied.Our margarita drinks were not lame either - and were strong enough.They also didn't skimp on the sour cream and guac so we really appreciated that.","1148":"Dempsey Hill pricey but probably the best texmex I have had consistently have eaten in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Ambience gets you out of the humidity. \u00c2\u00a0Margaritas are good not great, \u00c2\u00a0but my \"great\" is in either San Antonio or Houston on account of the those Rio Bravo limes.","1149":"Always enjoy this place. \u00c2\u00a0Authentic...not sexy mexican food. \u00c2\u00a0Good selection if tequila.","1150":"Overpriced and mediocre quality. However, this is pretty standard for Mexican in Singapore, so take that for what it's worth.","1151":"Taco salad was very nice ($19), but the carne asada ($49, signature dish) was not so good - the meat was low quality and stringy. We had to send it back to be cooked more (I.e., we had wanted medium, had to go well as the meat wasn't good enough for well). Service was quite slow, with them not checking on our meal or refilling water. I ordered ice water, and water came without ice. Took over ten minutes for the check after we requested it. Ambience was nice. Will try again, curious about burritos and fajitas.","1152":"If I were judging this restaurant on curve and gave it bonus points for being halfway around the world from Mexico, it would probably get 4 stars.Pros:-The menu is small, but a pretty good approximation of Mexican restaurants in North America-The chips were good; the salsa was excellent-The margaritas were excellent as wellCons:-The carnitas tasted pretty bland-The restaurant is expensive, even by Singaporean standardsI would probably go back, but I certainly will wait until I have a strong hankering for Mexican food before I do so.","1153":"Relatively bland overpriced Tex-mex. Sauce for both red and green enchiladas was in desperate need of chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder to add flavor. The red sauce was simply pur\u00c3\u00a9ed tomatoes (seriously...it was that lacking). Luckily, the meat (both chicken and beef) was good...not great....but good and not dried out, so the meal was edible. \u00c2\u00a0Side rice was not Mexican or Spanish or Latin in taste. \u00c2\u00a0Sadly, the best part of my meal was the side of black beans. For a minimum of S$18++\/a dish I would expect higher efforts. \u00c2\u00a0If they hadn't put a couple slices of jalapenos on the top, the dish would be totally lacking in flavor. \u00c2\u00a0If the restaurant would simply invest in a few spices (go on and add it to the guac too...it sure needs them), the meal could be WORLDS better. \u00c2\u00a0 I admit that it is hard to find authentic Tex-mex here in Singapore, but pretty much every other place I have tasted on the island is better. \u00c2\u00a0I didn't opt to try the margaritas (wow...highway robbery). \u00c2\u00a0I will make my own at home!","1154":"This was legitimately THE best food I've ever had in my entire life. Every item we ordered had so much flavor, and it all went so well together! I don't know what is happening in the kitchen but its pure magic. I'll definitely be coming back. If I could give this place 10 stars I would !!","1155":"I didn't enjoy my dining experience here at all. It had good reviews on google and I wanted to try some Malaysian vegetarian meal and Indian meal. This place seemed to fulfill both options well. I rejected better options like Komala Vilas, Kailas Parbat, MTR \u00c2\u00a0which were close and definitely would have been a better choice. We reached at 8:50pm and it said closed on the door. The closing time online is 10pm. The staff member said it's okay to come in. We were tired walking in humid climate so decided to get in with little ones.The service experience was definitely below par. 1* for the service. \u00c2\u00a0The staff asked do you know what you want without giving us the menu. They wanted us to hurry which I think is not fair if you have called us in. I could hear the dishes getting cleaned and staff talking loudly which was quite annoying.Food was alright. Thin noodles for kids were good and my daughter did enjoy it. Tom Yum was 3* and another entree which was recommendation was 2*. Two entree which I wanted to order was sold out. I think I just went on a wrong day. I will miss this one if I am in Little India next time. There are far better options to go to.","1156":"The food was delicious and the staff friendly, just be careful with the spicy dishes if your tolerance is low.","1157":"When I left, the man at the cash register asked me how my meal was, and I said, \"Don't judge me if I come back every day this week until the end of my stay here.\" It was seriously that good! I'm vegan, and there were so many options to choose from. All vegan options were clearly marked on the menu. After much debate, I ended up choosing the Nonya Laksa, which consisted of noodles in a curry coconut sauce with tofu and faux seafood. It was spicy but just the right amount (my mouth wasn't on fire or anything like that). It was so much food that I ended up taking half of it to go. I'm definitely looking forward to eating that for dinner tomorrow.","1158":"We had spent the morning exploring chinatown and Little idea, so it was only fitting to have a nice sit-down meal when lunch time rolled around. \u00c2\u00a0After reading some positive reviews, we decided upon Gokul. \u00c2\u00a0Atmosphere: 3.5\/5 \u00c2\u00a0It was nice to find a cool air-conditioned place to sit down and enjoy a meal in the hot and humid weather. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant was overall clean and had sufficient traffic without being too busy. \u00c2\u00a0The AC did get a bit cold after a while. \u00c2\u00a0Good atmosphere for a sit-down lunchFood: 4\/5 \u00c2\u00a0There were a number of Indian, malaysian and even Chinese items on this vegetarian menu. \u00c2\u00a0We had the paper masala dosa, gokul dum briyani, and butter chicken, which was more than enough for two of us! \u00c2\u00a0Very tasty dishes overall. \u00c2\u00a0I liked the paper thin texture of the dosa, except the masala was a bit bland. \u00c2\u00a0The briyani was delicious with lots of spices. \u00c2\u00a0Butter chicken was ok too. \u00c2\u00a0Overall satisfying meal after a morning of exploration.Service: 3.5\/5 Overall friendly and efficient; the dosa did take a while to come and unfortunately they gave us the paper masala dosa instead of paper dosa... we didn't mind though and I was glad to try something different.Price: 3.5\/5 Good for the amount and quality of food and space \/ environmentOverall: 4\/5 \u00c2\u00a0Overall a good experience at this vegetarian restaurant located in Little India. \u00c2\u00a0Lots of menu options for different palates and I enjoyed trying some authentic cuisine that we don't get at home!","1159":"I love this restaurant so much, when ever I go back to Singapore it is definitely one of the first places I eat at or order from. Any Singaporean delicacy that you want is available here vegan\/vegetarian. The mutton curry, chicken rice, and carrot cake are some of my go to buys! Curry puffs, and more! No one can tell that the 'meat' is not real meal! Incredible!Highly recommend - I even recommend it to people that don't live in Singapore I love it that much!","1160":"Super delicious. Perfect Indian spice with Chinese fake meat. A bit pricy, but otherwise totally worth it.","1161":"I tried this place when I was in Little India because I heard they had clearly marked vegan options on their menu (and they do). They have an ENORMOUS menu, but sadly not a lot of it is vegan -- but there are definitely still plenty of choices for vegans.I ordered the vegan mutton rice because I've never had mock mutton before and I was intrigued. And it was very good -- no gross soy-meat or other faux-meat aftertaste at all. It was nice and spicy, just the way I like it, and it came presented in a giant pyramid that I enjoyed gleefully demolishing like a small evil child.Atmosphere-wise, the place is quiet, pleasant, air-conditioned and not too fancy. The service seemed a little surly, but it didn't really bother me.All in all, good food and if I lived in Singapore I'd be back to check out their other vegan options!","1162":"Butter chicken - 2.5 starsI'm just not a big fan of mock meats. It tasted like gluten. Would've preferred tofu. But the sauce was pretty good!Basmati rice - 3 starsNot greasy but a bit dry.Paneer Pakora - 4 starsBreaded and fried just right! Wasn't greasy.Overall my 3 guy friends - all meat eaters - were pleasantly surprised with their fried prata dish, thali(?) and my food, which they tried. I think I liked it less than them though. Guess I'd go straight for the non-mock meat vegetarian dishes if I come back. Prices were very reasonable!","1163":"I am very intrigued by vegetarian places that offer mock-meat dishes. In the US, you find a lot of Chinese restaurants like Loving Hut offering mock-meat entrees, but this place has the Indian and Malay influence on the dishes. In addition, I also saw that they take credit cards - so off I went to try it out. I ordered the chicken tikka (made of soy) - which is baked in the tandoori oven. This was an appetizer, but there was a lot of tikkas and they were delicious! I was almost full by the time I finished the appetizer. For the main course, I ordered the chettinad \"mutton\" curry hot plate (made of soy as well) with a side order of tandoori Roti. \u00c2\u00a0This was spicy and just amazing! \u00c2\u00a0The Roti was awesome too! \u00c2\u00a0I washed all of it down with an ice Mooru (light salted buttermilk with spices) and masala chai. The masala chai was not that great. Overall it's a pretty unique place and highly recommended.","1164":"The food here is really over the top. Chicken Tikka is identical to real thing and very tasty. It is one of the few restaurants out there that serves Indian mock meat dishes. If you are a vegetarian and tired of being stuck in wonder at how Indian non veg dishes taste, look no further as the meat dishes here are as close as you can get to the real thing.That being said, the service while pretty decent did not match the same standards as the food, and the bathrooms have questionable sanitation.","1165":"This place is awesome!! \u00c2\u00a0Glad to have found some mock meat places for local dishes.The food was incredible!! \u00c2\u00a0Definitely coming back for more food!!! \u00c2\u00a0Had the chicken kurma, and mysore mutton. . Mutton was very realistic... and that Chicken Tikka!!!!!! \u00c2\u00a0Yummmm!!!!! \u00c2\u00a0And I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I had the nonya laksa!!! \u00c2\u00a0That really hit the spot.Don't bother with the restrooms though - seemed pretty gross. \u00c2\u00a0I will likely arm myself with wet wipes to avoid that next time.","1166":"Gokul at Upper Dickson Road is my go to for North Indian food. Doesnt matter that it is vegetarian, I have made meat-eaters converts. I love bringing local and foreign friends here.Their menu is extensive but I always flip straight to their North Indian dishes and order the same staples. Mushroom Kurma, Butter Chicken, Palak Paneer, Allo Gobi. Have it with rice or butter naan. The flavours are wholesome and savoury and I've never left the restaurant without feeling I needed to be rolled out. Yes, you will feel fat and full and I mean that in the best way possible.","1167":"I love the concept of gokul's restaurant as vegetarian people will not even miss out a thing. Their menu options is huge and you wouldn't even feel like you are eating vegetarian food there. It worked especially for me as I am a big fan of non veg food but when I have to be vegetarian on certain days I can go there to still feel like I'm not missing out on non veg food.Also they don't just have Indian food on the menu but they also offer a whole variety of local dishes in Singapore which is perfect for everyone!","1168":"I agree with other reviewers - Best vegetarian option in Singapore. Concept, prices, variety, taste and service - are all 5 star. Free flow of papadum with mint dip is wonderful. Love the tangy fish curry, the peanut sauce with satay and the three curry meal with roti jala.Even the dosai is better than the other dedicated places around this place.","1169":"The best Kofta Malai I have ever had! It's air conditioned inside (bonus), but that does mean it can get quite busy. Not the friendliest\/happiest staff, but considering the crowds the food comes out very fast. Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely worth the visit :)","1170":"On such a pleasant Sunday today, suddenly I had a craving for Indian food. In no time I was on Yelp searching for best Indian restaurants in Singapore. Read many reviews and finally took a call to visit Gokul along with my hubby. We ordered Paneer Pakoras which were delicious and soothing iced drinks- litchi and rose flavored. So far it was brilliant and I was overjoyed at coming here. Then for main course we ordered Parata set and Kochu parata set. Honestly both dishes were average and we dint really like the Kochu set.Biryani rice however was pretty good. Overall, feel satiated and definitely a one time visit.","1171":"Gokul's menu is completely vegetarian. But I would say to those carnivores out there, give this place a try if you're looking for Indian food because it really is one of the better Indian food places in Little India, vegetarian or not. There is a wide selection on the menu, including thosais, mee goreng, murtabak, and north Indian curries and naans. The curries were rich, fragrant and delicious and the mock meats were very realistic and unstarchy. When I went, i enjoyed my paper thosai very much. It was crispy and the portion was generous. I also enjoyed my friends' palak paneer and \"butter chicken\".","1172":"Gokul is my regular in the Fortune Centre which is basically a food hall with vegetarian restaurants. I've not tried all the places, but I go back for same Tikka Masala Curry and Gokul Dom Biryani. Its a good way of avoiding meat, its tasty, very good value and most importantly not too greasy. In fact the Biryani beats most others just on the fact its not too oily, as most places seem to overdo that.Service is run by a couple of older gentlemen so be patient and enjoy the wa of the place.","1173":"This is a place that has a really awesome looking menu with a very wide range of selection, clean space and reasonably decent food. They have some very nice mock meat options over here from which i would recommend to try the superb hyderabadi biryani. The mock meat from this dish tastes better than real meat and the rice is rich in flavor. The egg kothu paratha here is pretty decent as well. They also have a lot of singaporean oriented vegetarian food options like mee gorengs, kway teows, chinese noodles etc. My general feeling is that the food here is a little bit too expensive.","1174":"Looking for best sushi place in Singapore. Google showed most active reviews. I'm glad to find out about En Sushi. It was the reliable choice over another place I was going to.Very happy to have dinner here my first night in Singapore. Great staff, friendly. Easy walk from hotel. Food was tasty and fresh! I would reorder the same should I return.","1175":"This is a no-frills japanese seafood restaurant, located at the old K-Tower seafood restaurant, that was a seafood gimmick that failed, the owners decided to turn it around and serve what youngsters these days crave for. Bara chirashidon at $10.80++ . The serving of the seafood is value for money, though there could be more rice served. The sashimi slices are thick and again, very generous. The location is right smack in the middle of dhoby ghaut mrt and bras basah mrt. Lots of private schools around, including SOTA and SMU. There's even a nine fresh dessert stall next to it, for below $3 chinese sweet jelly desserts.I love the concept, and I think it can do well, though I noted that the business was kind of quiet on a weekday, I'm sure it will fare better on the weekend.But comparing this to sushiro, sushiro is way more value for money at $12.80 nett.","1176":"Straightforward sushi joint. The chirashi dons as pretty reasonably priced, the fish tastes fine, not spectacular but not cheap. It's a nice atmosphere and is well run with good service, so if you're looking for a simple sushi fix it'll certainly do the trick.","1177":"There is a new Food Republic in town and it is at the basement of Shaw Centre, where Lido Shaw Cinema is. Nestled inside the huge food court is Kimchi Xpress.It is a food kiosk, an offshoot of Kimchi Korean Restaurant in Suntec City. It is like an \"economy rice stall\" where you get to choose the type of rice (steamed white rice or fried kimchi rice) and the toppings on it. They called it it a DIY bibimbap. When you dine in the food court, the rice is served in the dolsot, which is lovely as you get the slightly charred or crispy rice after a while, like claypot rice.I assume the range of dishes (vegetables and meat) rotates daily as I do not see the exact same type of food whenever I am there. The prices have also changed from when it first opened. It is a bit on the high side ($7-$10) but then again it is Food Republic. I love the zucchini and fried chicken and those are what I usually have. I will add on the kimchi and ginseng chicken soup to make it into a set. The soup has a ginseng taste, not too strong but enough to get a bit of taste in it. You get a small piece or more like a sliver of chicken meat and a date in the soup. Only get it if you are used to having soup with rice, otherwise you may find it a bit of a rip-off. The kimchi is crunchy and good. I do not know why the spicy bean sauce (actually I have no idea what is the actual name, I always asked for the spicy sauce and they understood me) is not displayed. You need to ask them for it.","1178":"I've lived in Singapore for more than a year now. So, by now, I believe my taste buds (plus my die-hard love for food) can tell the difference between good or bad Malay\/Indian food. Well, that's what I thought until last night when I ventured into Shah Alam. This place is the BEST Malay\/Indian food in all of Singapore!I had no idea what I ate exactly bc I was so drunk, but we ordered a combination of different dishes ranging from chicken curry to mutton briyani to mee goreng to prata. My favorite was hands down the mee goreng! (So maybe I do remember!) Prata, my favorite Singaporean food of all time (Yes! I've paid USD$5 for prata before in the States!) was a so-so. The curry wasn't as nice and the prata part wasn't as flaky and much too chewy for my liking. If you're a drunkard in Boat Quay...uh, yea, I'll see you there ;)","1179":"This place is open till late in the Boat Quay area, and is a great place for supper.We came here around midnight, and got two portions of tandoori chicken, and an egg prata. Oh my, the tandoori chicken here is really good. I think their chicken is tender, moist, well-marinated, and probably not made to order, but reheated properly, and not microwaved. It comes with some sauce and onion salad on the side, so it is quite filling. What we had in mind were 2 pieces of tandoori chicken on a plate, but this was so much more than what we expected. Yum!P.S. The prata was okay.","1180":"Best Shabu buffet in town. Did I mention affordable too! Very friendly staff and very freshly displayed ingredients. They are absolutely not stingy with the meats too so eat as much as you can!","1181":"Little pot of wonders. With all the buzz of Wisma Atria's Japanese Gourmet town going around, I knew I had to give it a try and what better day and way than for my birthday. With the variety of food available, ranging from a restaurant specializing in Chicken Karage to Izakayas to one that does Saba 20 ways (grill, fry, sashimi. You name it they have it), we (or \u00c2\u00a0more like I) decided to go with Shabu Shabu Tajimaya, A. because I'm a sucker for steamboat \/ shabu shabu and B. because the wife (yey! We got married) isn't a fan of steamboats and she couldn't say no. What catches your eye first when stepping in, is the number of Japanese working here. Unlike other brands of Shabu shabu restaurants that barely feature one, Tajimaya had 3 in their relatively small restaurant. I've heard that the restaurants here are watched over by the Japanese tourism board and it's individual city's \/ province's tourism board so I'm not surprised if the food and service quality here is scrutinized closely.The restaurant solely does shabu shabu or sukiyaki buffet with 3 options available. I forgot to take a picture of the pricing so they may not be accurate but I do believe their prices have lowered slightly since their soft launch. There's a choice of standard ($33.90), Tajimaya ($47.90) which comes with Wagyu Beef or Deluxe ($77.90) which comes with their highest quality of Wagyu. We decided to go with \u00c2\u00a0the standard, which comes with Beef, pork belly, pork loin and chicken. The Dashi (soup stock) Forget your normal miso, spicy miso or pork bone stock here. What they do offer is a variety of unique stocks, never seen in other Shabu shabu restaurants along with a seasonal stock which you may check with the servers for. We went with the Yuzu Salt Dashi and Creamy Salted Rice Malt Dashi, which were both to die for and the absolute star of the show. They were both very tasty and very fragrant and complimented the vegetables and meats very well. I did find the Salted Rice Malt Dashi a tad salty but it's perfect for cooking your proteins in. The Protein. Off the bat, forget about the other meats and solely concentrate on the beef. Shabu Shabu is all about the beef and while the pork belly and loin sounds good, they are average at best. The beef on the other hand, even for the standard menu, is to die for. A good amount of fat helps the thin slices maintain their juicy, bouncy nature. The Vegetables \/ Carbs. What a variety. If you're a vegetable fan like me, the variety here is heavenly. What they didn't do was provide too many overpowering vegetables, instead, going with those that will compliment the soup wonderfully, like Daikon, carrots and leak. There's also the option of udon, konnyaku noodles and rice for the carb lovers and a very light, fluffy, pillow of fish cake which is very addictive. The condiments. Each table comes with 3 bottles of traditional Shabu sauces but if you're a fan of mixing your own concoction like me, that the condiments station is a playground. The minced ginger, garlic, ponzu and other wide varieties to mix and match, the condiments stations is by far one of the best stocked I've seen in any Shabu Shabu \/ steamboat restaurant. On a whole, I really enjoyed the food here. The beef was good, the stocks were amazing and the whole atmosphere is just buzzing with happy patrons. The staff are polite and alert too which makes for a great experience. Oh, do note that there is a 90 min time limit from the time you order, which is more then sufficient for us but might not be feasible if you're looking for a place to chit chat for long periods with your friends.","1182":"I just love Shabu Shabu, and this place lived up to my expectations. I love the spicy broth so got that, with some beef and pork. All in all tasted beautifully and ambiance was great too. Will be back next time I am in town. An instruction for non-asians would probably be good as I am never sure I do it the right way - but sure tastes good!","1183":"fantastic italian execution (not the head sort) at this packed restaurant in chinatown. reservations much required - tables run out quickly, and the place is well popular even on weekdays. it's been lauded as a great place to grab some italian and lives up to that reputation (living up to reputation seems to be a problem these days), with good service and reasonably prices.it spans that rather comfortable spectrum of cosy enough for date night but bright enough for family night, and the good food helps conversations flow.I'm not a huge fan of the mostly carb-heavy cuisine, but this side of it is right up my alley. lots of fresh seafood and ingredients simply done up and plated without too much fuss, enough to show detail and attention, but not enough that my food gets cold.it's also a fair portion size (barring the fish, which we'll talk about later), and I've realised recently how important this is for me. I've grown rather tired of poncy food in small dabs and dibs on a spartan place (unless it's truly meant to be that way - and what does that even mean?), and I want very much to feel satisfied and happy at the end of a meal.it was a meal of three starters and one main - and for good reason. the starters sounded more interesting and more creative than the mains (which were mostly plates of some seared meat-or-other), and were also cheaper (perhaps two or three starters were equivalent to one entree) - and they turned out that way too.we started with insalata mediterranea di verdure alla griglia, a warm salad of grilled grins topped with a light creamy cheese sauce and caramelized walnuts. I loved the sweet tender pumpkin with the crunchy nuts - and even though I usually eschew rich sauces, this was very tasty.and then the rather transcendental calamari alla griglia, or grilled squid coils with a lovely chop of garlic and herbs. delicious, plain delicious. seafood sweet and tender, these were salted just right and utterly fantastic.we had to round off the starters with some bruschette (it does, after all, take up a fair half page in the menu), and ended up with the etna, which had a slice each topped with chopped tomatoes, a grilled eggplant slice, parma ham and a slab of mozzarella. alright - but perhaps the most average dish we had. it was just a bit of toast with stuff, and not wholly inspiring (though the cheese was good).our nominal main was the day's special of salt-roasted fish, a slim specimen of a white type simply roasted with large grains of salt and served alongside a small salad. it was well cooked (and I don't mean doneness), with the flesh flaking off with a slight push - but it was also the most expensive dish at more-than-sixty for a slip of a fish, and not quite worth it considering what we had got as starters.it's definite that we had to finish with something sweet, and this time we had two. a tiramisu al pistacchio di bronte was a green layered rich concoction, with a very mild pistachio flavor - but at least it wasn't too sweet. a delizia al ciccolato was less interesting, and not flowy so much as moist - but it came with some delicious pistachio ice cream.I haven't mentioned service, and it was pretty good: just friendly enough without being unobtrusive, and they knew how to handle the crowds and seat people efficiently. price are very reasonable for the quality of food, though that statement holds truer for everything but the mains - and I'll be back to give some of their lauded pizzas a go.","1184":"The food is excellent here.The beef carpaccio appetizer was very good, as was the pork in marsala sauce.The tiramisu is outstanding, among the best that I have ever had.However, the level of service, for a restaurant of this price range, does leave a bit to be desired.Once they bring you the food, they never return a few moments later to make sure that everything is ok, or to check on whether you need anything.I should not really complain about the service as it is slightly above the usual abysmally low level of service in the food industry for which Singapore is notorious.I challenge any Singaporean to debate me on this issue.","1185":"I had had dinner at a restaurant earlier and left that restaurant still hungry, which isn't a good sign for me. I wandered into Etna as it had been on my list of places to go. It was very cutesy decorated and brought back memories of my honeymoon to Italy! It was about 8pm on a Wednesday night, the place was quite busy, and I was seated promptly. I was recommended a delicious Sicilian Cabernet and the mushroom pasta, and I have no regrets! They paired very well together! The mushroom ragout was very savory, which I love, and the portion size was perfect for me. I can't wait to go back and sample more of their delicious cuisine!","1186":"Disappointed with their level of service. Food was served more than an hour after we ordered. Orders were mixed up. Wait staff don't smile at customers. Food is priced too high but food quality is mediocre. The place is also very noisy. I tried to keep an open mind and look for good things about this restaurant, but could not find one.","1187":"Amazing calzone, superb service, really nice ambiance. Best Italian food I've had outside Italy","1188":"First visit to etna for dinner and I am abit undecided on this place. Had their calamari and beef carpaccio for appetisers, linguine al granchio and snapper for mains paired with merlot and sparkling. Whilst we were off to a great start with their impressive appetisers, mains were a tad disappointing. There was nothing spectacular about their al granchio and it was served up with a crab claw. I may be demanding on this but I did not foresee getting my hands dirty trying to peel the meat off the crab in a fancy Italian restaurant. Snapper was fresh with a delectable capsicum sauce but it is not something I would specially head back to a restaurant for. Their service staff were friendly but I expected more attention to details. Overall, it was good but not great. I would head back again just to try out their lunch menu and coffee though.","1189":"This a very fine Italian restaurant. Food is delicious and the service very friendly.","1190":"I was happy to choose Etna for celebration of my husband's birthday! \u00c2\u00a0I asked the restaurant to bring a cake for him as surprise in advance and staff did a good job!Also, the food, atmosphere and staff's hospitality are really nice. \u00c2\u00a0We had salad with mozzarella cheese, today's pizza which used lots of vegetable and looks very colorful! and lasagna. \u00c2\u00a0All of them were very delicious and the portion was just well. I felt Etna can be used for various situation such as for couple, girls night out or casual business dinner with reasonable price.","1191":"Just a quick one from me for this review.The atmosphere was pretty good here. Had a nice dinner with my sister and girlfriend. Yoi could have a nice conversation and it felt cozy. So a 5\/5 for atmosphere. The food was a 3.5. My sisters lamb pasta (forgotten to which type) was excellent one of the specials of the evening. I had the pizza which said ham, but when it came out it was prosciutto which was very unexpected and threw me a little as I don't generally enjoy that on pizza. My girlfriend had soft shell crab linguine which according to her wasn't great.In summary I would give it another try with different meals.","1192":"If I could, I would eat their pistachio tiramisu every single day. The best tiramisu in Singapore. The restaurant also ignited my passion for gnocchi and other pasta.","1193":"Meh. I don't think I'll come here again. Well, maybe? From the reviews, I thought this place would be fantastic but I was not impressed. We ordered the four items: 1. Burrata di Andria con Rucola, Pomodorini Pachino e Prosciutto di Parma 2. Wrapped and baked cod (Chef's special)3. Etna Pizza4. TiramisuThe burrata was fresh and the bf really enjoyed eating it with the parma ham but I wasn't too impressed. I enjoyed the burrata at La Latteria (basically across the street) much more. The baked cod was very disappointed. It wasn't fresh and barely tasted like fish! The Etna was definitely worth it! It came with parma ham and chunks of QUALITY mozzarella cheese! The pizzas were rather big so I suggest ordering just one to share. Maybe include an appetizer and some wine? You'll be good to go! As for the tiramisu, you MUST, MUST order it! The desserts are all made in house and the tiramisu was simply divine! The only dish I would die and come back for! It was covered in crushed pistachios, but special pistachios that are grown only in three parts of the world: Sicily, Israel, and Iran. So worth it! So DELLICCIOUSSS!! Service was alright, but, seriously, that tiramisu...*sigh*","1194":"Good service. \u00c2\u00a0Nice atmosphere. \u00c2\u00a0Very well prepared food. \u00c2\u00a0Spendy, but you get what you pay for.","1195":"Recommended! Delicious food, nice wines, great service. Couldn't ask for anything else.","1196":"Had dinner with my co workers here. Ambiance- very cozy, warm and intimate. The tables are situated close to each other thou the pace is not packed when we went there so it didnt feel as crowded.Service- the manager (or the owner?) is very attentive and give good recommendations. Thou the wait staff can have more training over attentiveness. We waited a while before someone took our order.Food- Most of what we ordered were the specials of the day. The food is mostly for sharing. I highly recommend considering the specials of the day for great selections.Price- a bit on the pricey side. Thou the pizza is reasonably priced, the appetizer and mains are a bit pricey.Overall great experience and would recommend to give it a try","1197":"Decent home style Italian place. It packs a busy crowd and you should definitely make reservation.The burrata appetizer is great. Most of the pasta were homemade. I didn't quite enjoy my pasta with truffle cream, porcini mushrooms and sausages. I usually dig anything with porcini and truffle, but the pasta is too thick for me, and the mushroom taste is overpowered. The other crab pasta was better but I prefer Valentino's version much better.Price point was very good. You get good value for money.Servings are a little on the big side so feel free to order to share. We wanted to order two appetizers to go with our two pastas and was advised by our server to just go with one appetizer. Good call as that left me with a tiny bit of stomach to have their dessert and a little cup of limoncello on the house. Woohoo.Service was great, warm and friendly. They made you feel that you are dining in a friend's home. The owner came over to ask if it was our first time here and how did we hear about them. I said YELP!","1198":"Etna offers fantastic Italian food in a nice setting, for days you'd like to treat yourself. I tried the Eggplant Pizza, one of their homemade pastas, and the calamari and shared among my group of 3. I found it to be just the right amount of food for us.","1199":"I'd been to the one at East Coast Road before, and while the service was excellent, the food I tried was mediocre. This time around, however, it was the food that was great and the service was decent but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were nice and polite, but I didn't feel I could chat or really talk to them, which is fine, but a more casual approach would be nice. That being said, the restaurant does look a lot classier than the one in East Coast, so I guess they're catering to a different crowd who doesn't talk to service stuff much. Who knows. I had the Penne Arrabiatta ($18), which was just spicy enough and the pasta was cooked just nice in the traditional Italian al dente way. Too many places here sell out and overcook their pasta because that's what most locals prefer, so I like places like Etna and Modesto's who stick to their guns and serve it how it should be served. I also tried the Bruschetta ($8.50), which was really yummy. Bruschetta seems so simple but it's so easy to go wrong with it; Etna got it just right. I can't recall the name of the wine, but the red house pour was really good and went perfectly with the meal. By the time I was done with this, there was no room in my belly for desert, so I gave that a miss. Either way, the pasta and wine is ACE. :)","1200":"The lasagna was excellent. The pizzas are thin and crispy. The ravioli were small but good. The tiramisu was great.One downside was that they took the burrata appetizer off the menu. Another is the prices, which are high. The burrata pizza (32++) doesn't have mozzarella other than strips of burrata which are added at the end, so it is colder than a typical pizza.","1201":"Very good Italian food hidden away in a shop house on Duxton Road. \u00c2\u00a0Service is always exceptional and the food is always just what it should be. \u00c2\u00a0Straightforward high quality Italian dishes. I have been here 5-6 times (always for lunch) and am never dissappointed. \u00c2\u00a0The weekday set lunch menu is a good bargain. \u00c2\u00a0The small dining room is simple (maybe a little on the dull side) but tasteful with white table cloths and cloth napkins. \u00c2\u00a0I wish they could knock out the wall between the two rooms to make it a larger more interesting dining area. The wood fired pizza oven is at the rear of the dining room in full view. \u00c2\u00a0Highly recommend Etna for both food and the attentive service.","1202":"Excellent service, excellent food, friendly atmosphere. Real Italian chefs! I've been a regular for 5 years. Try their Tiramisu -- it's the best in Singapore!","1203":"I am a convert to yakitori after dining here. I never really like yakitori as those I had tried before were pretty ho-hum. Grilled meat on skewers. Nothing special or mind blowing. I have walked past Nanbantei countless times but somehow have never dined there. It just never appealed to me as the menu looks limited and the specialty is yakitori which is not my favorite type of Japanese food. Then a friend dined there and said it was good, and the lunch menu has decent pricing. So it stayed at the back of my mind for the \"one day\" moment. Well, that day arrived when I walked past it again and decided to just try it. The place was packed and apparently you need a reservation. I was lucky and got a spot with the caveat that I would need to vacate in an hour as someone else has a reservation then. There were only 3-4 tables with the rest of the seats surrounding the chefs table where you could see them grilling the meat. Everyone was patiently waiting for the meat to be ready and food to be served. It seemed like everyone just ordered the yakitori bento which was a good deal. Yakitori bento consists of 5 sticks (asparagus wrapped with pork, pork with shiso leaf, tsukune, leeks and pork and quail eggs), miso soup, rice with 3 toppings, pickles and dessert (red bean and mochi). All that for under $20 makes it a value for money meal. The meat was so perfectly grilled that they were tender and juicy. They did not need to rely on the sweet sauce or heavy seasoning to mask any smell or taste. It was just the best yakitori ever for me.","1204":"This is a solid 4 stars, deserving a visit if you are in the area, and crave this kind of food.This is quality, authentic, and good value, all rolled up into one. \u00c2\u00a0The reviews by other yelpers (Carolyn, Ricky & Seth) are spot on, so there's not much for me to add.They do take reservations, though obviously not required, but most helpful as it's a small restaurant, and especially if you want a seat at the counter, which my wife & I enjoyed.Our favorites were the unagi and grilled zucchini w\/ cheese and tomato on top. Our dinner for 2 with 2 beers was $101++, but could easily be enjoyed for less. I would return.","1205":"This old gem of a restaurant is one of the best kept secrets in town. The affordable and satisfying set lunches are what's worth coming back for. No efforts were spared despite being a set lunch, moreover the portions were not skimpy. Taste was excellent as far as Japanese food goes. Expect nothing extraordinary but just good food done right. Reservations can be taken online which make it a breeze!","1206":"Not our first time here. \u00c2\u00a0We came to a conclusion on this place is that u need only for for the grill stuff. \u00c2\u00a0The rest u can get any place else as they are not as good. \u00c2\u00a0This time around we decide to hit mostly the chef's recommended menu and boy they were good. \u00c2\u00a0Especially the wings as we had 5 orders of it :). \u00c2\u00a0The trick here to is to order a little at a time say 3 to 4 grills at a time so your grills will remain nice and hot. \u00c2\u00a0The downside is you have to wait which is probably a good thing as you will have time to digest and decide if you will order more. \u00c2\u00a0All in all a great place and hey if they have Japanese customers here they are most likely doing something right.","1207":"Nanbantei is a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant in Far East Plaza, which specializes in yakitori. \u00c2\u00a0And while the yakitori is decent, it isn't anything special. But the course sets are a good value and includes a nice selection of yakitori and sashimi, and the larger sets include grilled fish and a nabe as well. \u00c2\u00a0The yakitori + sashimi set is a good way to go for one or two people. \u00c2\u00a0The sashimi is a bit limited but fresh; however, the slices were inconsistent in thickness. \u00c2\u00a0Among the yakitori, I enjoyed the negima and asparagus bacon, and the shiitake was also very good. \u00c2\u00a0There is a small selection of shochu and sake, which is also well-priced. \u00c2\u00a0Overall, while I wouldn't say that Nanbantei is great, it is a good value.","1208":"Nice cozy place for a casual dinner. \u00c2\u00a0The meat skewers are good. The chicken wings are crisp and not oily. love the grilled sweet potato too. It's not on the menu, so you have to ask if it's \u00c2\u00a0in Stock, \u00c2\u00a0and takes 20 minutes to cook. When \u00c2\u00a0I was there last week, the bill for 2 amounted to 67$. Grilled unagi at 18$ was the single most expensive item we ordered but the others (chicken wings, asparagus and bacon, mushrooms) cost 5-8$ per order of 2 sticks. The place is always packed, \u00c2\u00a0so make reservations and expect close quarters.","1209":"One of my favorite and affordable Yakitori places I've been in town! Overall, this restaurant can satisfy your crave for a meal on sticks. Food is slightly on the salty side, and slow service is expected during peak time.","1210":"Yum. It's a tiny venue but the food packs huge flavors. I've never been a big fan of japanese izakaya street bbq skewer type food (is that what it's even called)? But this place has converted me. Everything is flavorful and delicious and it's fun watching the cooks grilling everything right in the middle of the restaurant. Prices seem reasonable. This place is worth checking out.","1211":"This Japanese cuisine at it's finest. \u00c2\u00a0A travel back in time. \u00c2\u00a0There are no bad choices. \u00c2\u00a0Lots of locals and business men. \u00c2\u00a0If you are in a hurry this is not your choice. \u00c2\u00a0Each and every item is made to perfection. \u00c2\u00a0We had 5 in our party and shared orders. \u00c2\u00a0If you have a choice eat at the bar and watch the process. \u00c2\u00a0Entire staff is Japanese and very helpful & friendly. Top floor of the mall and in the same location for 30 years. \u00c2\u00a0Prices a bargin. \u00c2\u00a0The Yakatori \u00c2\u00a0is better than in Japan.","1212":"Overall pretty good place for sashimi and chirashi bowls. The fish is fresh and I found the sashimi to be especially delicious, but the other fish I tried were just decent and nothing too special. For the good quality of the fish, I found the price to be pretty reasonable as well.Food:- Kaizen Chirashi Don (Large): This bowl comes with a few pieces of various sashimi (salmon, salmon belly, yellowtail, tuna, scallops, ikura) along with rice. The portion size for the large is quite generous, and was definitely filling for me. The salmon and salmon belly were both very flavorful and had a nice texture. I wasn't a huge fan of the other fish, but they tasted pretty decent. The ikura was a bit too fishy for me though.- Aburi Kaizen Chirashi Don: This is the same as the Kaizen Chirashi Don, except the fish are all seared a bit. This is more expensive, and I overall felt the regular bowl was better. The searing tastes off a bit too much of the flavor for some of the fish.- Sake Sashimi: 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. Very tasty but was a bit pricey for the portion.Service:No problem with the service, but be prepared to wait if you come at peak times. I came on a weekday and the restaurant was nearly full (with a lot of reserved tables already).Price: $$\/$$$The Chirashi Dons were both $26.90, though the normal one was a Large size and the Aburi one was a regular size. The Sake Sashimi was $6.90 for 3 pieces. They also have various other bowls which range from $19.9 to $40+ for the expensive ones such as otoro or uni.","1213":"Great place to get sushi in Singapore! Had a friend that kept raving about it, so finally gave it a try and was worth it! Located on the 5th floor of the Takashimaya shopping center on Orchard Rd. Everything for presentation looks amazing to eat. Fresh and thick pieces of sashimi. Beef was also really tender, soft and flavorful. Everything was delish, would recommend! Only gripe was service isn't that great, not very attentive but we'll still go back for the food!","1214":"I think this restaurant's services is very good! The waitress is very patient with us and be very nice to us even though it was so crowded. We ordered the sashimi, tempura, tamago, sake sushi and unagi avocado roll. Everything were so delicious especially the sashimi, it was very fresh!! Furthermore, I like the environment that it had the bar counter. However, it was a little expensive so I am going to give 4 stars instead of 5.","1215":"The sashimi is fresh and thick. The kitchen shows creativity, and some dishes are delish (e.g. pitan tofu), while others are avoidable (e.g. wafu spaghetti, teba gyoza, unagi fried rice, scallop mentaiyaki). The portions are minuscule, so you could end up spending $75 per head (without alcohol) before being full. At least here, they take some credit cards (not Amex), whereas the original Sushi Bar outlet at Far East Plaza (which is cheaper) only takes cash. At this price level, with minimalist service, you'd be better off going to Ginza Kuroson Takashimaya on 3\/F for much better ambience and better food. People will mourn the disappearance of mid-price, varied Japanese eateries at Nghee Ann City, like Sushi Tei or Ichiban Boshi. Now, for reasonably-priced Jap, you have to go to the basement lah!","1216":"The sashimi is fresh and thick. The kitchen shows creativity, but some dishes are good (e.g. pitan tofu, or the daikon salad which looks like a mini yusheng and tastes ok if you don't mix the awful sweet pink stuff), while others are terrible (e.g. wafu spaghetti, amaebi karaage, scallop mentaitaki cut so thinly it breaks). The portions are minuscule, so you could end up spending $70 per head before being full.

Prices are reasonable too!","1218":"Tried out this place on a review by a fellow helper. One detail, it is on the 5th floor of the Takashimaya shopping center.I ordered the scallop mentaiyaki and the Kaisen chirashi don for lunch. The don was pretty good except for the tuna and salmon which were a little fibrous. This meant it wasn't the best cut of fish or it was not prepped properly. Overall it was a very tasty dish. As for the scallop it was sliced very thin and tasted amazing with a mildly spicy mayonnaise and some truffle (I think) oil. I does come across a little greasy. Other than that the dishes were very good for about US$33.","1219":"The place brought back a fond memory. It's funny sometimes to think that everyone seems to have moved on, while I got stuck in time and resist to grow up. I stepped in right at 9pm when they took the last order. I opted for the torched sashimi over rice, same as last time- at $26, it's a big bowl full of fatty pieces. Though anti-carb, I cannot stop eating the rice as it's the right texture and almost bouncy on my teeth. Also, the sashimi was so fatty- I had to use the rice to balance. ;) Imagine how satisfying it was.. Now, I am ready for my midnight flight home. ;p Until next time..","1220":"The Sushi Bar is a few steps away from Sushi Tei but how people still pick Sushi Tei over The Sushi Bar is a mystery to me. Only explanation could be that they do not know there is sushi heaven behind the corner.The place was packed on a Thursday night around 7 pm, but we managed to get a seat right away. Overall, the service was super quick and food appeared almost instantly.I will join the choir and sing praise for their kaisen chirashi don: it really is as amazing as you read in the reviews (and the reviews of their other location). The fish was amazing, the slices were thick and super fresh. I had trouble finishing the normal size don (granted I had a late and rather big lunch) which is a first!Highly recommended!","1221":"I truly regret not trying this place earlier! Yes I've heard about this place also having one of the most worth it chirashi sets at a good price. Well... Everyone was right! As seen on Yelp, I went for the popular items right away - the scallop mentaiko carpaccio to share, I had the premium chirashi and my friend being a smaller eater had the normal chirashi. The premium chirashi even came with uni inside with big and plump ikura! Everything was generally very fresh, however the prawn was a bit slimy and strong tasting to be absolutely honest. Everything else was to expectation and a little above, given the great feedback all over the Internet. One thing about this place that really stuck out was their stuff which are aburi-ied (flame torched) ! Anything that they flame torched wasn't just for show. It really does bring out that extra flavour! They seemed like masters at it. Even down to the scallop mentaiko carpaccio! That smokey flavour.... I miss it already!They seem to have a chirashi bowl that is all aburi (torched on one side and raw behind)! I absolutely can't wait to go back and try that! I'm giving this outlet 4.2 out of 5 stars! Would have been slightly higher if it weren't for that lousy prawn! ;)","1222":"This branch of the sushi bar offers more seating and a larger menu. Service, however, is brusque and sullen. The aburi salmon roll they are famous for is flavourful at first bite. The dollops of mayo on top lends it sweetness and creaminess, with a touch of saltiness that accentuates the other flavours. However, once you remove the dollop of mayo on top, the roll itself is extremely average. Though fatty and plump, the salmon itself is not particularly flavourful. The filling of avocado and crab stick and lean maguro don't contribute much in terms of flavour too. So I would say the star of the dish is the mayo! :) \u00c2\u00a0There are better quality sushi options out there at a similar price point.","1223":"I'm a huge fan of The Sushi Bar at Far East Plaza, so I was pretty psyched when I heard they were opening up another location down the road at Ngee Ann City. \u00c2\u00a0In some sense, this location is even better than the original. Blasphemy, I know! \u00c2\u00a0I find that the food selection here is a lot more extensive than the original. The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember. Second, the Ngee Ann City space is far larger and has much more of a restaurant feel than the hole-in-the-wall experience at the original location. Third, the queue is a tad bit shorter. \u00c2\u00a0In any event, the aburi dishes are the real winners of The Sushi Bar, separateing them from every other sushi restaurant in Singapore. I'm not familiar with the term \"aburi\", but from what I understand, it is essentially grilled\/torched raw fish. The Sushi Bar has perfected the art of torching high quality sushi, leaving the edges burnt with the inside nice and raw. Simply, an awesome combination. In short, depending on whether you fancy chirashi or sushi, you should order either the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, Salmon Aburi Roll or both!","1224":"Enjoyed dining at this new outlet at Ngee Ann City. Sat at the sushi bar itself, good initiative from the chef to ask how he can help or serve me when he noticed me looking out for the waiter. Tried the salmon sushi roll, nicely torched and love the combination of taste of the sauce with salmon when I popped the sushi into my mouth. My hubby had the regular Chirashi Don, and the portion looks slightly bigger compared to the one he had at Far East. Would love to come back to try more next time!","1225":"If you are craving for the ultimate aburi chirashi bowl, you are at the right spot. This is a must try. Fresh and thick slices of sashimi, torched just enough to release the omega three goodness, coating the rice below, this is literally a bowl of heaven if I can only imagine. Their other dishes are also very competent and all rather reasonably priced. Make a reservation to avoid long queues.","1226":"The sushi here was reasonably priced for what you ordered. Went for my friends birthday and they came out with a candle on top of the Maki. A nice touch!","1227":"My first time trying The Sushi Bar chain and it was a splendid experience indeed. This branch is pretty new, hence I'm the first reviewer. The queue was pretty long and told that we had to wait for 30 mins (on saturday night about 6:40pm) but we only waited for 18 mins. Woohoo!Anyway, we ordered their two kinda signature dishes:1. Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don $26.9This is basically the main attraction and the star of the night! The combination of torched fishes with fresh glistening pearls a.k.a ikura is just perfect! Don't forget the rice is magical too! Toppings are generous with fresh grated wasabi and sliced ginger!2. Salmon Aburi Roll $15.9Raw salmon rolled with crabstick & avocado and topped with torched salmon! Double salmons attack! Great for salmon lovers! And two non signature dishes but very delicious as well:1. Teba Gyoza @$3.5 but no minimum orderAs good as I thought it'd be! Yes, you might have guessed it, it's actually chicken wing stuffed with gyoza fillings. Creatively delicious! Me love!2. Amaebi Karaage $6.9I always love Japanese sweet prawn sashimi and The Sushi Bar definitely nails the fried version.The ambiance is pretty nice, sophisticated decor and spacious area. Perfect for casual dining whether with a date or family. It is well hidden and located at the ngee ann city (behind serenity restaurant). Price wise, I think it's very reasonable too. I'll be back.","1228":"Ordered the scallop mentaiyaki, it was rly quite good for mentai lovers. We also ordered a chirashi don which were only average to taste. The rolls on the menu which has the recommended signs should be good to order. I got the soft shell crab roll which tasted rly not bad! The cold soba was rly overpriced in my opinion. The waitresses were alright, average standards. Attended to us when we wanted to order and for top up of drinks, otherwise they just stood at a corner which I felt they probably could be a tad friendlier? Overall, it was an alright experience, probably won't be back again.","1229":"Great sushi! Worth the penny, worth the wait. My picks when I'm here are the Dragon Roll, Scallop Mentaiyaki, and Salmon Aburi Roll. Love to wash these down and cleanse the palette with some Green Tea.","1230":"Came here a few weeks back with my friends, who were having a massive craving for some sushi. Although located quite centrally (in Taka), I had a difficult time looking for the shop as it was tucked away in a corner. We were quite early, and didn't have to wait too long for a table, so that was good! (Though I've heard it can get pretty crowded, so do try to go early!)The service was a disappointment; the waitstaff was less than attentive, and my friend had to get her own water, after asking for it a couple of times. The food however, was their saving grace. I loved their salmon aburi roll & the sauce they put in their sirloin steak; it was a nice balance of sweet and salty, and acidic. It was also reasonably priced!Would definitely recommend this place if you're okay with substandard service.","1231":"My second visit at the Ngee Ann outlet for dinner. The place was relatively empty when I arrived around 645pm but by 730pm, a queue had formed. I had tried to make reservations but couldn't get through the line. The restaurant will only seat you if everyone is present. I had the aburi kaisen chirashi don for $27. The seafood was fresh and perfectly seared. My only grouse was that the rice could be seasoned better and a larger portion of rice provided because the amount of seafood overwhelmed the carbs. I guess that is a happy problem to have.","1232":"We had only one idea: eating sushis we could pick from a selection on a \"conveyor belt\". We looked on Yelp and found this place. Being in Orchard Road, it would be easy to find. Well, in fact, you have to go up to the last floor of the mall to find it so it's a bit hidden. But the place was exactly what we were looking for. There were not so many different kinds of sushis but enough for one meal. They offered big rolls that were delicious.As expected (because it's sushis, Orchard Road and Singapore in general), the place isn't cheap. We paid something like 70$ for two at lunch but we had eaten to many sushis. ;-)","1233":"0 zero star! I was totally disappointed with the service. Touted as cheap and good, one will still have to fork out large amounts of $$$$ for this place . So, don't be fooled! The seating is worse than a food court with less than 10 cm between tables . If you are 2 person, there is no way you can order enough food to try as table space is limited . When asked how does one eat without space, no answers ... and they do not come back with any solution. If there is an option for no star , I would have opted for that. Won't come back.","1234":"I saw a picture of a grilled squid online and couldn't resist trying it on my recent trip to Singapore. The squid was tender and delicious, and the environment was authentic, relaxed, and perfect. My friend tried the tuna hand rolls and remarked to me that they were the best he'd ever had, and overall we had a great time.Tomo Izakaya is definitely a memorable experience, especially if you're interested in going outside your comfort zone and trying new food!","1235":"Ate here because of convenience. Ordered a tonkatsu bento that comes with unlimited rice and miso soup, salmon sashimi along with Japanese starters. While eating the salmon sashimi, there was a piece of hair sticking out from the wasabi. It was curly... I wanted to throw up. I flagged the waitress down and told her what I found. When she came back with the bento box, it was the same exact box that she had taken and she just put a new bowl of salmon sashimi. Talk about sanitary... I did not get an apology along with my \"new\" bento box. Wouldn't recommend this place. Food is mediocre.","1236":"My husband and I stumbled upon this sushi establishment late one night after arriving from a long flight and finding most other places closed for the evening. \u00c2\u00a0We ordered our usual nigiri and sashimi and were delighted to find that the waitress recommended different types of soy sauce for each dish. \u00c2\u00a0The fish melted in your mouth. \u00c2\u00a0The quality was unbelievable. \u00c2\u00a0The value for money was really so much better than expected. \u00c2\u00a0It's now a regular place for us when we're in SG.","1237":"(3 stars, but giving it 2 to compensate for the over-ratings from the other reviews)Contrary to the other reviews, I beg to differ with regards to the food quality.Food quality-wise, it's the average izakaya fare. Grilled, fried and some sushi\/sashimi items to pick from on the menu. I passed on the sushi when the fish didn't look too fresh. The grilled squid was previously frozen before getting tossed on the grill, and was rather chewy. The udon was generally run of the mill. The only saving grace is the stewed pork rib.This is a place to get cheap beers, hang out and watch the world go by at the Esplanade. Service is good, and there's a variety of items on the menu. It's a notch above the regular strip-mall sushi joint. However, if you're looking for great Japanese food, this isn't the place.","1238":"Just sushi nothing special over price the only good thing is the location ramen was very taste less","1239":"One of our favourite place for Japanese. We especially love the tomo Caesar salad and the soba. The maki and temaki are pretty good. We enjoy the laid back atmosphere and the good service","1240":"I decided to stop by this place with my wife after work. During a return flight to Singapore on one of the famous budget airlines, I discovered an article that listed establishments to grab cheap beer in Singapore. Now, most of us know that Singapore is an incredibly expensive place to drink alcohol. That's a fact that many of us have to live with. Well, this article stated that Tomo Izakaya had $5 beers and cheap Japanese eats. It was pretty much a must visit after reading about $5 beers. Finding this place was easy. It's close to the Esplanade, and in a great part of town, close to the river with a great view of Marina Bay and the CBD. We took a seat and really enjoyed their d\u00c3\u00a9cor and setting. We ordered a couple of $5 Japanese beers and few bites which included 1) bacon scallop skewers 2) cold soba noodles 3) sushi roll 4) Seafood salad 5) chicken karage. The only thing that stood out was the skewers. Everything else was not memorable. We'd probably return for the $5 beers, but we don't plan on grabbing more food here. 3 stars for the cheap beer and the attentive service.","1241":"My friends and I were looking for a nice outdoor dining area and eventually ended up at Esplanade. Izakaya Tomo serves Japanese cuisine, and I'd say that you will have to try their grilled food items when you get here. We ordered the soft shell crab maki, unagi maki, bacon-wrapped vegetables, grilled squid, grilled beef, and grilled mackerel - we ended up paying about $23 per person in a party of four.Izakaya's unagi maki takes the prize, hands down. The unagi simply melts in your mouth as you bite through the firm and fresh rice ball to reach the center. The unagi is also not overly oily or slimy, so those worried about that will have less reason to hesitate ordering this dish. The soft shell crab is crispy and relatively salty (as should be expected), but not remarkable. I also wondered how difficult it would be to ruin bacon-wrapped vegetables: in any case, I loved Izakaya's version. The bacon fats are grilled nicely, with pepper bits decorating the meat at the surface.The grilled squid was a little tough and could have spent more time in the heat, but I had nothing to complain about the mackerel: thin-crisp skin combined with the succulent white flesh of the fish, tinged with freshly-squeezed lemon zest. You also can taste the smoked flavours as you savour every bite. The grilled beef - my friends concurred - was done just right: sinewy but not tough, with the temperature wavering between medium-rare and medium.Ultimately, I'd say they do their grilled food very well; and the ambience is unbeatable. The cool breeze from the waters nearby, live music in the distance, and open space so that you don't need to compete for elbow room while dining.","1242":"Tomo Izakaya at Esplanade Mall is a hidden gem. The location makes for quiet dining (sorta) with a slightly more sophisticated crowd and relaxing ambience. Gyu Tataki ($13) is the beef version of sashimi. Lightly seared on the outside then marinated with lemon, vinegar and soy sauce after, it was served with pounded ginger and spring onions on top of the rare meat. Very big slices of beef which really worked our jaws. There is none of that bloodiness or heaviness of the red meat. Oishi.Skewers were next. Who could say no to BBQ bacon wrapped anything? The smokiness of the fatty pork flavored the succulent and sweet hotate chunks ($10), giving each bite a burst of juices and flavors.Shitake Mentai Cheese ($7) is a must order. The woody and juicy shitake goes perfectly with the crackling bacon and the mentaiko cream was simply the icing on the cake.The Tonkujyou Chirashi ($36) is really the highlight of the meal. The special chirashi is worth every bit of that 36 bucks even though it's a small bowl. Tomo is very generous with the fresh sashimi. The fatty toro was creamy with fats and extremely well marbled. There was so much uni and salmon roe to go around that we had to finish all the vinegar rice (which was delicious on its own too). One of the best chirashi bowls in town and reasonably priced.For reviews and more, visit my blog.","1243":"Never packed, great food! Makes for a real decent, dignified dining experience. The sashimi was also decently delectable for an izakaya place. All other barbecued-based dishes were also lovely. A go!","1244":"Finally managed to make it here on a weekend at noon. The broth is really flavorful, maybe a little too rich actually. The noodles are excellent and absorb the soup really nicely. The rest of the ingredients are par for the course. Quite reasonably priced at $11 a bowl. Likely one of the best ramen places in Singapore. Taking a star off for the long queues and lack of card payment...","1245":"Came here on a Thursday at approximately 11.30am. It was pretty empty and was ushered to seat on the commune table as I was on my own.Without much hesitation, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with flavored egg and without black fungus. For beverage, I ordered green tea cola.Food came within 5 minutes. The broth was not as rich in flavor as I would like it to be. The noodles were in between of soft and hard and it delivered.Like what others commented, this place can get crowded during peak hours and it was difficult to head out after meals. Service was inconsistent and price wise was reasonable.Overall, I still prefer their Kani King chain.","1246":"This is to me the best Ramen in town. Been eating here for 2 years and never being dissapointed.A part from queue for quite long in the peak time, everything is GREAT","1247":"This the oldest and most popular outlet of the Ramen Keisuke chain. It is located at the Orchid Hotel, next to the another well known Japanese restaurant Teppei. The outlet is very small with limited dine in area. Seats are very close to each other. Do take note that only cash payment is accepted here. There is no NETS or credit card payment available here.Similar to other outlets, there was free flow hard boiled eggs and marinated bean sprouts to help yourself to. There was also sesame seeds to add flavour to the ramen. One could customize the ramen as similar to other outlets.The table was very small, barely had enough space for the food and the condiments on it.Tonkotsu Ramen ($10.90++)The pork soup base was rich and creamy. One would also add the grounded sesame seeds and bonito flakes to the ramen for a stronger flavour. The dish was such as pick me up for a cold night that one would forget about dining in such a small narrow table.","1248":"There are already lots of positive reviews already.My experience here agree with their findings. We had the spicy ramen with everything and the black ramen without \"everything\". I ate 2 eggs and my gf ate 2 eggs, I ate almost halve of the free beansprouts too. I am not sure if they made my money this time, but I sure did enjoy my meal tonight.I hope they remain in business so I can come back again.","1249":"I was there around 8:00pm and there were about 12 person in front of me, waited less than 15 mins. Not bad, the size of the shop is not big, people tends not to sit long Like other reviews mentioned unlimited supply of free boiled eggs and bean sprouts, you can't eat much anyway.I have ordered a Tonkotsu King Ramen with seaweed. The noodle texture is just right and the taste of the soap is good, not too oily. I didn't give 5 stars because the soup is not hot (temperature) \u00c2\u00a0enough. Service is excellent, very polite. I was impressed by though quite a bit of people queuing outside, they still kept refilling the water and no intention to kick you out after you finished. Most of us very discipline, eat and go. I will come back to this Ramen place next time. Worth to try if you never been there.","1250":"You need to get lucky when you visit Keisuke as there is always an endless queue at this place during meal times - and working in the area, I attest to that personally as someone who has witness these queues for the last year or so. There is not a walk to the MRT station at the end of the day that I don't see a snaking queue outside this outlet. I got lucky - on two separate occasions in fact, once at lunch and the second time at dinner today. I say lucky because while there was a queue, the wait wasn't too long - we 'skipped' the queue during lunch because we had a table for our (smaller) group size opened up. At dinner today, we did have to wait for a bit (~15minutes) but again were lucky to skip past a group in front of us. So my tip here would be to go only in groups of 2! - the shop is rather small, so they have more 2 seaters, which gives you a higher chance of a shorter wait. I tried both the red spicy and black spicy tonkotsu noodles on the respective visits - added all ingredients in the red, and just an additional egg for the black (cause dinner needs to be a small meal :P). I have to say that while I loved both soup bases, their chashu is rather inconsistent. I loved the melt in your mouth piece that I got at dinner compared to the 3 rather tendon-filled, tough pieces that I got when I went for lunch. I think it's again, all about luck when you done here, depending on the day etc. because the same happened for my egg - Japanese ramen eggs are notoriously awesome because of its yolk consistency (at least for it it is) and the egg that I had at lunch was disappointing because it was more hard-boiled than runny. My colleague on the other hand had a perfectly runny egg. ): But I guess that was redeemed by the egg that I got when I went for dinner. They had free hard-boiled eggs at the table, as well as marinated bean sprouts that I would definitely recommend everyone to try! I guess for quite a number of people, this is a highlight though I wouldn't concur as most of the ramen places in the Tanjong Pagar area have this free hard-boiled egg perk. The food here is really good, when you get lucky - which is why the 4 stars. It lacks consistency in both the broth (my dinner partner had been here before, but he had horrible tasting broth - when we went for dinner, his feedback was that it was a lot better than his first try) and their ingredients, which I feel is really sad because every visit could be a hit or miss. Keisuke Tonkotsu has a sister branch nearby in 100AM serving the ramen with a chicken based broth instead, which I hope to go try someday.","1251":"Ate here several times (even before Yelp was created), and now that I've eaten it, I'm reminded of Yelping and thus here's my review. You can read the rest of the reviews, they are largely accurate (except for the criticism, maybe they had blocked nose and hence their sense of taste went haywire). Haha. I would say that I've never tasted any broth as thick and flavorful as Keisuke's Orchid Hotel - in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0In addition, you get to have a multi sensory experience - space is cramped (a la Japan), you crush some sesame seeds, and the aroma fills the shop. Technically you should go in, eat fast, and get out fast, similar to Japan (correct me if I'm wrong). Of course you can eat slowly to spend more time in the shop, but why deprive others of their noodles? :DTldr: broth thick, noodle\/ramen qq (springy), meat is nice! One of the best ramens I've ever eaten, and for that price, yeaaaaa.","1252":"Came here for a late lunch so avoid the long queue! Yay!! Saw that they actually provided free barley for customers who are waiting in line to help themselves to, they even left several fans in case it get too hot. That's nice. I ordered:Black Spicy Ramen - the broth was thick and savory. I opted for the noodle as 'normal' texture so that's nice for me. The soup was not spicy at all, just a hint of it. The pork slices were thick and flavourful, but a little tough. I opted for additional flavour egg and it was good, soft & seasoned at the yoke. Free beans sprout - I thought it would be plain boiled bean sprouts but I was surprised to find a small jar of bean sprout goodness left on the table for your own service. Their bean sprouts were boiled and seasoned with sesame, spicy oil and something yummy. I only know I CANNOT stop eating that!! I wanted to whack the free eggs too but was way too full from the free bean sprouts to do so. Will return if in the area, just to whack the bean sprouts again!","1253":"We came here on a Friday afternoon around 3pm and the place wasn't very busy at that time. \u00c2\u00a0We were quickly seated and given a checklist menu to order our ramen. \u00c2\u00a0I had the classic \"Tonkotsu King Ramen\" with the flavored egg and the \"normal\" authentic Japanese taste (as stated on menu). \u00c2\u00a0While we waited, there was a large bowl of hard boiled eggs for us to eat. \u00c2\u00a0This is what my gf remembered as her favorite thing about this place. When the ramen came out, the broth was deliciously rich and thick, definitely the best part of the ramen. \u00c2\u00a0The noodles were good as was the soft boiled flavored egg. \u00c2\u00a0I was expecting a little more sides and the Chasyu wasn't served the way I normally like it, I like mine melt in your mouth soft but it was ok. \u00c2\u00a0Would definitely come back and try their spicy ramen on a \u00c2\u00a0next visit to Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0I liked the Green Tea Cola in a bottle as well.","1254":"My favorite ramen in Singapore! The bowls aren't perfect - perfect ramen should have perfect broth, noodles, charsiew, and Keisuke only gets 2\/3 of these down pat - but it's never disappointed me since I was first brought here 4 years ago. Speaking of the 2\/3 things, this chain of Keisuke (and likely the others as well, though I can only speak for Paya Lebar, Bugis Village branches) has such deliciously milky and rich broth!! Their menu is simple, with the original or black (pepper) or red (pepper + chili oil) versions. I ordered the black version, but I honestly don't see much difference between them - they're both really good. The noodles are also great, al-dente, not too soft, not too chewy, delicious. It's not the sapporo style ones that resemble instant ramen, but the straight-cut Hakata-style, just like Ippudo's. If you've a bigger eater, definitely order extra ramen for a few bucks!Also, I didn't list the flavored egg as one of my criteria for perfect ramen since its pretty much a basic pre requisite. Keisuke's is perfect and hits the spot. The charsiew is a little meh. Nothing special. The little extra perk that Keisuke offers is the free-flow bean sprouts salad & hard-boiled eggs. Some people go really crazy on the hard-boiled eggs and I don't really understand why, but to each his own. I'm a huge fan of the bean sprouts! They taste slightly spicy and sweet and are so addictive. I gulp down whole bunches of these with my noodles. I'm not kidding, sometimes I literally finish half the container at my table. Kind of strange, but this is definitely one of my favorite things about Keisuke!","1255":"Nearly perfect blend of flavor and spice. Being a food simpleton, I tried the Spicy Red Ramen with none of the extra accouterments. I wish the broth had a slightly more pork fat taste but I had a hard enough time finishing it as it came because I stuffed myself silly, like the good little tourist I am, on peanuts from Long Bar while I waited 20 minutes for my drink. I am giving 5 stars because I specifically requested a medium pork fat flavor, expecting the strong option to overwhelm the spice. I regret that decision but it was still a mighty fine bowl of ramen. My first in 6 months! Thanks Keisuke!","1256":"Yelp brought me here.I was in SG on holiday and was excited to see SG on yelp!I walked here from where I stayed at in Clarke Quay.I waited a good 45 mins in line and it prob would have been a longer wait if I was eating with someone (party of 2)I counted about 22 chairs, so it's small... hence the long line. You preorder on paper while waiting... so when you get seated your order comes right out.I'm not a ramen fan but I did eat everything. I had the original with everything.What I didn't like was the customer service. no one came to fill up my water. what's up with that???I guess they are too busy trying to flip tables.If you're in SG and love ramen come here but come early to avoid the long line.","1257":"Any day can be a ramen day for me!!I have been returning for many good bowls of delicious, hot ramen in this store. The only irks is you have to share those tiny tables and the space is rather tight. Hence, the line is long at times but come early to avoid it. Pros:Free bean sprouts and hard boiled eggs for allSapporo bottled beer available hereAyataka green tea available hereThe pork broth is goodThe egg is delicious that comes at $2Cons:You gotta pay by either cash or nets Credit card is not available here...","1258":"Welp. What a disappointment. But let's start with what went well. The broth is great and is how a good tonkotsu broth should be : thick, rich and extremely flavorful for all 3 types: normal, black (peppery) spicy and red (chilli) spicy. The oils, ground sesame seeds went well with it. The noodle was nice and firm. The portion of meat was great. For 15.80, it came with all the good sides, including 4-5 big slices of pork And that's exactly when things went to crap. Those big slices of pork. Oh, they held so much promise. But the first warning sign came when I noticed that any signs of the good ole usual layers of fats seem to be missing. Strange. Maybe they were using a lean cut. But nope. Biting into it was like gnawing into a gunny sack. Dry. Oh god SO tough. Flavorless. It was awful. Enough to spoil the meal for me I guess. The chef has clearly way way waaaay over cooked the meat, making it extra tough and dry, and of course, melting all the fats away. In short, I would sorta recommend this place if you're vegetarian and looking for some great ramen and broth. However if you, like me, find the pork to be an extremely integral part of a good tonkotsu ramen, I would recommend you stay far far away","1259":"A solid choice. I took the Japanese style ramen and it does taste like ramen in Japan. The concept with the all you can eat eggs is nice. A great value for money place!","1260":"Cash only. I find that the portion is too little esp the noodles. For extra portion its $2The noodles tasted great and the broth tasty. Small joint with usually a crowd for lunch.We were suppose to line up with the other establishment but we just decided to come here due to long wait on the other side.","1261":"Came here after another super yelp elite party. Really wanted to get some food in the tummy and this place closed at 1030pm. It was perfect. Imagine hot soup in a really empty stomach at 10pm. The best way to cure hunger. I have to say the service was pleasant. Whilst waiting for our turn to get into the restaurant. We were offered free Japanese Barley Tea. Which was actually barley rice tea. And we waited for a mere 15 minutes and we were in. Our waitress was great and got us settled easily. What helped this place is that our orders were pre-taken when we were waiting outside the restaurant to get in. great concept. We barely sat for 5 mins and our food arrived. Pictures were taken and it was then time to eat.While this is a good place for Ramen, there are better ones. The broth didn't speak much to me, And i really had wanted to try the lobster king ramen. but it wasn't available here, only at their clarke quay branch.Well i would have to give it a taste soon. Ill be back!!!","1262":"My friend brought me to this place Keisuke Tonkotsu King for Ramen recently. What attracted me the most was the free flow of soft boiled eggs! Guys like me who are training up their body would need the extra protein boost! The shop is rather small in scale but it makes the environment much more cozy. Queue is also quite long so people who want to go try the food should go early.The soup is thick and full of flavor. Noodles are just nice and of large portion!","1263":"One major complaint: this place is way too small! We were here right at 6pm when they opened and we managed to walk in straight away. \u00c2\u00a0But the tiny space filled up almost immediately even before our noodles are served.Free flow of hard-boiled eggs, bean sprouts at each table is a nice touch. But note that you do get a perfect onsen egg in your ramen, so I would advise against bring too greedy with the free eggs.Ramen - I prefer the original to the black broth. The black version has a spiciness that reminds me of Sichuan spice and I feel that it took away the sweetness of the amazing tonkotsu broth. I would only go for the original next time.The pork slice is nothing compared to santouka. I didn't finish mine.Order original with extra firm noodles and less oil, that is my perfect bowl of ramen.Plus...thank you yelp for finally allowing reviews to be posted via mobile app!","1264":"Delicious, delicious. I love good ramen and I'm so happy my friend recommended \u00c2\u00a0Keisuke.I opted for the spicy black king, which was delicious. I've had other ramen with black broth (Ramen Dojo in San Mateo, CA), but this one has a different flavor. It's more black pepper-y. When they say spicy, it's pepper spicy not chili-oil-burn-your-mouth spicy.Boiled eggs and bean sprouts are also offered at the table, so eat up!","1265":"So my quest to look for a decent bowl of ramen in Singapore (despite what you think of this metropolitan city where you can find almost every cuisine readily available, it is not -that- easy to find very good ramen) took me to this place where I dedicated a good part of my Friday night, post-work at. Queuing, that is.Be sure to come ready to queue at this little outlet (or the one nearby). If it helps, they serve you green tea and you can order your ramen first so your wait is shortened just by a little. Naturally, I was very hungry and full of expectation when my dinner partner and I were finally showed in.Ramen is served very quickly, along with your personal stash of beansprouts and boiled eggs. So that was a relief after the long wait. I picked the pepper ramen with regular soup broth and regular ramen (eat the way Japanese do is my battle plan for the day). Go for the regular soup broth if you, like me, are a fan of thick and rich broth which are just that slight bit salty. I love the way the flavours melt into the noodles. I wouldn't go for the pepper flavour - thought is was a little unncessary and will head straight for the original the next trip. (Yes, a next trip is already planned).If you are one for bites on the side like gyozas with your ramen, head for their other branch. I heard the gyozas are fabulous. Will be back to report on it.","1266":"I was stunned to find myself even a degree less than obsessed with Tonkatsu King. \u00c2\u00a0After my orgasmic experience at Tori King, I was prepared to be charmed and then wholly seduced by Chef Keisuke Takeda's take on tonkatsu, my most favorite variety of ramen.As with Tori King, the noodles (I ordered hard) were perfect and the free eggs and bean sprouts were great. \u00c2\u00a0Alas, it was the broth that took me aback. \u00c2\u00a0Although I ordered the richness of the broth and the chicken oil both normal, the broth was filled with many small brazen globules of fat. \u00c2\u00a0Try as I did, I was unable to convince myself that it was simply another way to get collagen to my lips, and though the overall flavor was nice, I had trouble truly bonding with my bowl of ramen. \u00c2\u00a0For the time it took to get into the small eatery, I'm not sure I would wait in line again. \u00c2\u00a0If I do go back, I'm going to order a lighter broth.PARTING THOUGHT: I'm still planning to try the outlet in Millenia Walk and will definitely be back to Tori King!","1267":"This is my go to ramen store. I love their thick broth and side bean sprout. You have the options to choose the saltiness and the oiliness of the broth, which is great. Their flavor eggs are so yummy. One bowl is around $10 before tax and service charge which is on the lower end for ramen, considering they give out free eggs and bean sprouts.","1268":"We loved this place - Keisuke Tonkotsu King. The flavor of the soup and Ramen was fantastic. We felt the flavor was what its suppose to be, ramen was served and cooked at the right texture and moment. Eventhough we had to wait for a moment in line but it was worth the wait during lunch time.Would definitely be back next time!","1269":"I had passed by this place many times and seen a long queue outside at lunch and dinner, so I figured I definitely have to try it! Due to the long queue outside, I made sure I went early or lunch... and still had to wait. Still the wait wasn't long as the turnover rate is quite high, and people just eat and leave quickly. The place is really small and can seat only about 20ish people. Ambience here isn't fantastic, and it's not a place to hang around for a drink after. You just eat and go.While I was waiting in the line, I was given a menu to choose between the basic tonkotsu, the black spicy or the red spicy ramen. I picked the basic tonkotsu ramen special that came with all the toppings because I'm greedy like that. You get more for a top of a few dollars. They take your order while you're in line.At last, we managed to get seats near the counter, but it was interminably hot! Perhaps my corner didn't get much air circulation, or maybe we were just too near the counter where they prepared food, but it did get uncomfortable.My bowl arrived, still steaming, with a large sheet of seaweed sticking out on one side. I pushed the seaweed into the thick broth and mixed everything up. It was mouthwateringly fragrantThough it was unpleasant sweating over my bowl of ramen, I still enjoyed it immensely. The ramen noodles weren't the best, but they were springy - just the way I like it! The soup is probably one of the most authentic I've had in Singapore, really thick and milky, even if it was a bit salty. Be sure to grind your own sesame into the broth for an enhanced flavour. It definitely makes it taste yummier. I found the char siew meat a little tough, but the egg with the liquid yolk was just divine. I really like those eggs. But I found it hard to finish up all the soup. I normally do at other ramen places, but the soup here was a little too rich to drink by itself, or maybe i just wasn't in the mood that day.They also serve free hard boiled eggs on the table - free flow! You can eat as many hard boiled eggs as you want! I had 2 with my leftover soup and then gave up, but left with a very full stomach, feeling really satisfied with the meal here.","1270":"As a Japanese who just relocated to Singapore, I would say this ramen place serves something very similar to what I would expect in Tokyo. Just like everyone else mentioned, be ready to queue (that's what local ppl say here in Singapore... having brought up in California, I just say \"be ready to stand in line\") upon arrival. If you are a huge ramen fan, I think it is worth it.You can personalize your ramen the way you want it to be. Just make sure you remember what your combination was, so that when the waiter brings you a bowl, you know you have the right one (and they speak with the local accent, so be ready to listen and focus).One thing I would like to do next time is that they have all-you-can-eat hard-boiled eggs at each table. Instead of ordering \"flavored egg\" for your ramen, I think this will work if you just drop the regular hard-boiled egg (the free ones) and let it sink in your ramen for a while.That would take a few SG$ off your bill.A bit on the expensive side, but I think they are staying true to the Japanese style.","1271":"Wow, seems like this ramen is really damn popular!!!Not that there's no good reason for this though. I absolutely love the pork broth here. Whether it is the black, red or original, all are damn tasty! Savoury yet not oily! The flavoured egg was decent as well. But I would say one major disappointment was the meat. The meat was tough and cold :( And I also loved the interior of the place. Cosy (and most say SMALL), with lots of traditional ramen shop decor. I also loved that they played many Arashi songs when I was there (pardon me for the fangirl moment. haha)So overall, I'm still willing to give it a second chance! :)","1272":"I'm giving a 4 specifically on the strengths of the black version, which I adore. I adore it almost as much as I like the Nantsuttei one (apples and oranges, though). It's rich and almost reminiscent of your favourite black pepper crab memory.. except here, you can slurp is all up quite happily.I also prefer the noodles here. You can specify soft, normal or hard for noodle texture. I have a distinct preference for crunchy, thin noodles, and while I do like Ippudo and Santouka and all the rest, Tonkotsu King's noodles win for me. The rest of them leave me full and never wanting any more; Tonkotsu King's noodles always make me order 'kaedama' ($2 for extra noodles. Leave some soup for it). Slurp!It's more central than most of the other ramen hotspots, and the queue tends to be manageable. To be fair I wouldn't know about the regular version and the red version... but the black one is quite something!","1273":"Keisuke Tonkotsu King will probably be amongst the top 3 places slapped with a \"must-try within 1 month\" command if you are working in the Tanjong Pagar area. This little nook is more affectionately known as the \"Orchid Hotel ramen place\" - a lazy moniker referring to the building it is situated in. The place is always packed at lunchtime with a line of people sitting patiently on itsy bitsy stools that rests against the glass of its shop-front. Ramen here is taken extremely seriously and you get to make decisions like how hard you would like the noodles to be, what level of spiciness your broth should be and so on. The waitress leaves you to ruminate over you choices with a slip of paper and pencil and returns to hustle you to your seat when it is ready. You always enter to a couple of shouts from the kitchen, welcoming you in traditional Japanese fashion and soon a steaming bowl of ramen is plonked before you. The soup is flavourful but always a tad too oily for my liking and the slices of meat that come along with it are also much too tough. I do, however, enjoy their noodles because it is always springy and never overcooked. Mention this place and you will definitely be told about how your ramen is accompanied with free flow of eggs - that is probably the most exciting bit of news for me.","1274":"This popular ramen stop is located a couple minutes from Tanjong Pagar MRT station (exit Tanjong Pagar Road) and is adjoined to Orchid Hotel. You will often see a string of people waiting to get in. We went on a Sunday night at around 730pm, and, while bustling, we only waited about ten minutes for a seat. The small restaurant seats about 20-odd people and serves ramen - that's pretty much it, but you do get to make your own! When queuing outside, the waitress will hand you a piece of paper and you tick the boxes - do you want your ramen soft, normal or hard? Do you want to have light chicken oil or do you prefer your soup more artery-inducing? After ticking the boxes, you hand it to the waitress and wait for your turn to be seated. We waited around ten minutes (with about four groups of people ahead of us). The ramen is served pretty much the moment you sit down, so it ticks the box for fast service. Is it good? Well, I think there are better ramen places in Singapore, but for the bargain hunter there is a free-flow of eggs and you also get to ground your own sesame seeds in cute bowls to bring out the soup's flavour. Due to the speed and high volume, I thought the broth lacked consistency (I got mine with light chicken oil), but the noodles (I selected \"normal\") were just the right texture and flavour. Altogether we paid about $35 for two bowls of ramen (including everything), which comes up to about $17 each. That doesn't make it the cheapest place, but so I would give it an average rating for value-for-money and taste.","1275":"It's not uncommon to see long queues outside this quaint and cosy little ramen place tucked away in a corner of Tanjong Pagar. But please, do yourself a favour and join in the queue! This place is one of my top places to go to for ramen. And... they provide a free-flow of hard boiled eggs. What's there not to love?Let me first state my ramen preferences: I like bouncy noodles in a broth that isn't too rich (not gravy like) and oily, with a slice of char siew that contains enough fat to melt in your mouth. And a well cooked flavoured egg of course! I had the Black Spicy Ramen on my last visit, and it almost met all of my requirements. I was happy with the noodles and the broth, but found it a tad oily for my tastes. The char siew was perfect, and reminded me of the ones I've had in Japan. I've had better flavoured eggs elsewhere (Tampopo!). But overall, this is a pretty decent place to go to for ramen, and to bask in an authentic Japanese ramen bar setting.","1276":"This outlet of Keisuke specializes in Tonkotsu Ramen, which is made from a rich milky pork broth. Keeping things simple, they have 3 flavors to pick from- Original, Black Spicy and Red Spicy. Black Spicy is a pepper based spice while Red Spicy is a fresh chili paste.The first thing i heard about Keisuke was their free flow boiled eggs and seasoned bean sprouts. That kinda contributed to the long queue i guess. Not that much of a cheapo to go for such stuff, especially since bean sprouts are the bane of my life.The ramen could be easily customized using the order form. Kinda idiot-proof. I went for the original with seaweed and flavored egg. And a little bit of spring onions. Don't quite get who would go for the 'no char siew' option.Despite the less oil option, there were a lot of pieces of fats in my noodles. I dutifully scooped out most of them.S's spicy red ramen with normal oil level. I didn't quite like the red spicy flavor as it was more of a dull piquantness than a savory one. The original broth was very rich and flavorful but it was also rather salty.Our verdict on the ramen. It's not bad. We concluded that the broth was on the same level as Santouka's or better. Santouka happens to be his favorite ramen in Singapore. I wasn't too pleased with the char siew though as it was drier and tougher than the high quality pork cheeks that we are used to at Santouka. But the egg? Simply awesome. I could inhale 5 of these realistically speaking. Nice gooey texture in the middle and the soy infusion right to the center of the egg. Lovely.I wouldn't mind coming back for ramen IF the queue isn't insane. Certainly one of the better ramens around.","1277":"It's just another noodle soup :)~14 sgd for an average lunch ramen is not good value for money to me. Pork quality not really good. Small space and low-end service. Probably people are more hyped up by the crowd outside rather than the food and the price.","1278":"Any meal that starts with a big bowl of eggs in the middle of the table is bound to end well. The same can also be said for a restaurant that you can find by following a cacophony of slurping. As you may have guessed, both of these things proved true at Keisuke Tonkotsu King. And while we could debate for days about the authenticity of the chasyu, or whether better shio, shoyu or kira miso can be found, it's really the amazing, amazing tonkotsu that made this spot queue-worthy. It's all customisable which I loved - not just your preferred extras, but your noodle texture, any ingredients you don't want floating around in there, the style and strength of your broth (red spicy, please!) and your oil level. And oh that amazing oil - it's like they picked up those piggy bones and wrung them out into a bowl the size of my face. It was milky and delicious - and for a moment I forgot that I was about to step back outside into 35 degree heat. They truly do churn through the queue, so don't expect it to be a leisurely lunch. My advice? Get there early, slurp away, and move on so the next person waiting can enjoy this deliciousness.","1279":"Love this ramen!! Slurpworthy soup and perfect noodles! And of course you get free flow sprouts and eggs!","1280":"Ramen, like choosing a car, watch, or spouse, is all about \"personal taste\".And \"personally\", I like \"taste\". I like so much taste that that for me Keisuke Tonkotsu King Ramen is the place for me when it comes to ramen. I don't think you can find another tonkotsu (pork based broth) place where the soup is as rich, as oily, and as fatty. Yup. You heard that right. While a few of the other reviews have commented that the soup here is too oily, I'm sayin' that's why I love it. FAT IS FLAVOUR. Say it with me. FAT IS FLAVOUR. And at Keisuke Tonkotsu King, the soup has visible pieces of \"flavour\" floating it it. Just the way I like it.Like the more serious ramen places you find in Singapore (and indeed, overseas), you choose the consistency of your noodles, and then customise your soup. If it's your first time, don't be shy. Go for the middle option for everything, don't ask for less oil. FAT IS FLAVOUR. Don't forget. The 'onsen' egg is done perfectly. There's a big basket of hard-boiled eggs for you to help yourself. You can grind your own sesame seeds. There's beansprouts for you to add to your soup. In terms of free condiments, (as far as I know) no one comes close to this shop. \u00c2\u00a0So be forewarned. The soup is really rich, kind of greasy, and probably incredibly fattening. It's not for everyone... YET THE QUEUE IS STILL ALWAYS SO LONG! :(","1281":"There is a reason this place is called Tonkotsu king - it rules when it comes to tonkotsu broth. \u00c2\u00a0I hate to queue\/wait in a line for food, even if the food promises to be delicious.But I am one that can be convinced by friends to try something once and luckily I was rewarded with one of the best bowls of ramen in Singapore (the free barley tea outside helps too).The food:The menu is simple and to the point - only three flavors of ramen are served here with possible add-ons of eggs, extra pork, or seaweed. \u00c2\u00a0Each bowl of ramen can be customized for noodle tenderness, broth richness, and chicken oil content. \u00c2\u00a0While I declined any chicken oil, I loved the al dente noodles and bold broth. We got to try two of the three flavors and both broths were heavy with rich tonkotsu flavor. \u00c2\u00a0I liked my spicy red tonkotsu broth - the flavors here were mildly reminiscent of Szechuan flavors with its red oil (though not the same type of ma la flavor). \u00c2\u00a0 You can request fresh sesame seeds to grind in to your broth. \u00c2\u00a0Top this off with free hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts and you leave a very happy diner.Be warned that you may have to wait during peak lunch and dinner times and literally rub elbows with your fellow patrons. \u00c2\u00a0But you will be happily slurping away when you get your ramen. \u00c2\u00a0Slurp on with the king!","1282":"Truly the King of the Japanese Ramen BrothDo you know that there are two Keisuke shops in Singapore - Keisuke Tokyo Ramen at Millenia Walk and Keisuke Tonkotsu King at Orchid Hotel?Keisuke Takeda is precisely known for his creation of very unusual soup bases cooked with prawns and crabs, not the usual classic soup bases like shio, miso or shoyu. Ironically, Keisuke Ramen in Singapore which initially started selling only the very unique prawn based flavour, switched to selling the usual after customers' feedback. Keisuke Tonkotsu King, the little ramen shop at Tanjong Pagar, goes back to the basics. There is always a queue here, for the reasons that the ramen is really quite authentically delicious, and the shop can only sit about twenty. You can choose between the basic Tonkotsu Ramen ($10.80), Black Spicy ($11.80) or Red Spicy ($11.80). I would suggest a Tonkotsu Ramen Special All Toppings ($14.80), and you can also indicate if you want your soup to be light, normal or strong.While I may have preferred the noodles over at Ippudo or Marutama, the char siew at Santouka, and the tamago at Miharu, the Tonkotsu soup at Keisuke is the best - thick, milky, tasteful, flavoursome and slightly salty. I finished till the last drop. The soup wins, hands down (you may still argue it is too salty).","1283":"Sadly, it was too salty even though opted for normal. Tasted ordinary, noodles were ok, disappointed.","1284":"OMG!!! Amazing Ramen! Cheap prices! No wonder there is always a line. This place offers delicious ramen. best I've ever had in my live (and I have tried many places in Japan...). A bowls of Ramen per $11.5 (less than 6 pounds) and a beer for $7.5 (less than 4 pounds). Heaven on earth for just under 10 pounds... If you are in SG, go! Go now!!!","1285":"Having dined at 4 of their branches (Keisuke Tori King, Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons, Keisuke Tokyo, and Gyoza King), we thought it high time to visit the mothership where it all started. We had:1) Black Spicy Tonkotsu King ($11.80) with Flavoured Egg ($2): so thick the broth was practically viscous. I couldn't finish this, it was terribly cloying. I should have ticked the 'light' option for the soup base, this needed to be watered down to half its viscosity.2) Red Spicy Tonkotsu King ($11.80) with the option of Special Topping ($4) comprising a flavoured egg, seaweed, and stewed pork: just as stodgy. And the pork needed more flavour and stewing time.The best part of the meal was free: the marinated beansprouts that were totally refreshing, lightly spiced and delicious","1286":"Rich, robust broths with loads of taste , usually packed with loads of flavour. The great thing is the ability to customise your order - you can choose hard noodles, soft noodles; how rich you want your stock to be; the amount of chicken oil; etc. And it comes in three variants - the usual tonkotsu broth, the tonkotsu broth with red chilli oil, and the tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil. All of them are good, but just different. The normal tonkotsu is just so porky and intense. The black version features black peppercorns for a spicy kick and for contrast with the porky broth. The red version is just as delicious, rather intense in its spiciness. And the eggs are done perfectly. There's also free beansprouts and eggs to munch while you're waiting which thankfully isn't long - once you get in! Just love this place - just don't like the long queue![My ratings are determined by the class of goods \/ services provided i.e. 5 stars represents the best in the industry for that particular class of goods \/ services; 4 stars represents excellent; 3 stars represents OK...and so on]","1287":"This place is not as good as MenTei ramen on Robinson Rd, but it's cheaper and good ramen for value depending on what you add in. The menu is simple enough -- you make your selection on a piece of paper with check boxes: spicy \u00c2\u00a0vs non-spicy ramen, noodle firmness, chicken oil amount, and broth strength. I went with a non-spicy tonkotsu ramen with all normal selections for $10.80 plus service charge & tax. The best part was you get some sesame to grind and pour into your ramen, and you also got free unlimited hard-boiled eggs & bean sprouts on the table! The queue is usually quite long during lunch hour because it's quite a small place inside, but my coworker and I went on a semi-rainy Friday 1pm and we happened to catch a window when there was basically no queue.I'm glad I have another good ramen lunch option around the Tanjong Pagar area!","1288":"I truly recommend to select normal tonkotsu ramen not spicy one. Noodle is slightly different from other tonkotsu ramen restaurant, e.g. Ippudo and so on. Seat Rotation is very slow , so you must wait for around 30 to 60 mins on the weekend dinner time.","1289":"Good rich pork stock, though I prefer tonkotsu from elsewhere. The queues are long but move quickly, partly a testament to how quickly the kitchen moves too. It's very simple here--pick the soup stock you want (plain, red or black, the latter being spicy), what condiments you want (seaweed, onsen egg, charshu), the degree of doneness of the noodles, how much chicken fat you want (protip: fat is flavour) and away you go. If you need more flavour, there are additional seasonings on the table. OMNOMNOM","1290":"When I'm too lazy to navigate the nightmare traffic to Mandarin Gallery for Ippudo's red bowl, I go to Tonkotsu King.There's usually a queue but you should be able to get a table within half an hour. I would not recommend for a big group to eat here, they'd be able to fit parties of 2-4 easily and quickly, but any more and you might find yourself having to split up\/wait for a long time.Price is fair and you get to customise your ramen based on how much oil you'd like in the broth, type and strength of the broth, hardness of the noodles and whether you'd like seaweed or flavoured egg to go with, or both. In the name of efficiency, you mark your preferences on a sheet while standing in line so your order gets sent to the kitchen when you reach the front of the queue.There is a barrel of cool (barley?) tea next the entrance for hungry\/thirsty contenders in the line - a nice little gesture like this is always appreciated.Once inside, there is plenty to occupy you while you wait for your steaming bowl (which doesn't take very long): conscientiously grind sesame, peel your own hard boiled eggs, or nibble on pickled bean sprouts.I love that it feels a little like I'm eating in a hole-in-wall noodle shop in Japan when I'm at Tonkotsu. I always get the black pepper bowl, it's a good quick fix for when Ippudo just seems too far away and too long a wait.","1291":"Keisuke is located at 1 Tras Link, a 3 minute walking from Tanjong Pagar MRT. It often has super long queues during lunch and dinner. Be prepared to queue for at least 15 minutes during its most busy period. Food wise, the ramen is decent. It is one of the better ramen restaurants located in Tanjong Pagar. Placed on the tables are unshelled eggs which you are suppose to shell, while waiting for lunch to be served. It provides good entertainment while waiting. I would not recommend going there with a big crowd though - getting a table might be impossible.","1292":"One word - SHIOK. Love the firmness of the ramen, the crazy delicious black spicy soup and the tender slices of pork. The complimentary hard-boiled eggs and bean sprouts are also surprisingly very good and addictive. I always eat a whole bunch of the bean sprouts as an appetizer. However, even though I usually indicate less oil, the broth is still too oily for me. I guess it's all part of the dish! I would really like to eat this more often, but these days, the ramen is way too oily for my taste. But if you love ramen, I'd totally recommend this! YUM!","1293":"Hands down the best Ramen I have ever had and I will be thinking about this place forever. \u00c2\u00a0First the all you can eat egg and bean spout salad( salad was addicting) and the Ramen you can make it to your! Black with everything, extra chewy noodle, with intense favor. The black crush sesame totally brings out the favor.... and the super rich thick broth was serious heavy.. and the perfectly poached egg to just send me over for more noodles please!","1294":"Heard from a friend about a ramen place close to Tanjong Pagar MRT which constantly have long line during lunch\/dinner hours. At 1st I thought that it's just another ramen place which open during this recent Japanese food invasion in Singapore. After reading the reviews here, I decided to go during off hours to avoid any lines. The place is sooo tiny, no wonder there's always a line if it gets busy just a bit more. You'll be given a paper to construct your ramen: how thick you want the soup, how springy you want the noodle, onion or not, egg or not, pork or not, and also different kind of ramen (regular, black spicy, and red spicy). I chose the complete regular with normal soup and firmness. The soup is pretty thick with visible fat floating around (this is a good thing for me!) even for the normal, the seaweed is in the shape of big rectangular cut peaking above the bowl, the egg is runny once you break the white part, and the ramen is springy! If you think you want more ramen, tell the waiter before you finish the soup - there's an explanation on the wall about this. Pretty shiok ramen from this small place on a non-touristy area.","1295":"This place totally gets it when it comes to healthy breakfasts. \u00c2\u00a0Would have given a 5th star if it was little bit less expensive. But then again, this is $ingapore!","1296":"Everything is pretty much gluten free. Good food but no ambiance. Great for quick breakfasts.","1297":"I have never ever been so disappointed by lunch before.I got the Superfood Salad, which was $18 ($19.80 after ++). See the picture attached with this review and decide for yourself if it's worth it. It's basically a tiny bed of tomato and lettuce mix with a teensy weensy bit of almond and walnut sprinkled. The dressing was tasty though.The general consensus is that if this place was $5 less expensive, it would have been okay. But it's not.I am typing this review in a queue for fish soup from a nearby hawker center because I felt like I haven't had lunch, even after paying $20.","1298":"My work colleague always orders from Kitchen by Food Rebel and I've been coveting her zoodle with meat sauce for weeks. \u00c2\u00a0It's not far from our office, so we treked over there Friday for lunch. \u00c2\u00a0First off, it's expensive, even for Singapore, and their margins are pretty insane. \u00c2\u00a0I mean I had a zoodle (zucchini spiralized with meat sauce) and it was $18. \u00c2\u00a0 I'm pretty sure a zucchini cost about $1. \u00c2\u00a0The budda bowls looked pretty tasty, they also had some really good looking vegan desserts like carrot cake, an avocado mousse and brownie, but again all pretty steep on the price. \u00c2\u00a0They serve breakfast and wine (not at the same time) and are a cute little place to go grab dinner with a friend or coworker, and the zoodle was good. \u00c2\u00a0They do use quality ingredients, but for me it's still a bit steep.","1299":"Kitchen By Food Rebel is a cafe that makes clean eating delicious and filling! The food is delicious, healthy and creative - and I know where it has come from. The variety on the menu means there is something for everyone - if you want gluten free, dairy free, raw, organic, then you've come to the right place. The staff are wonderfully friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend the vegan buddha bowl, incredible hulk smoothie and the rebel pie.","1300":"Great food and service, and not really expensive for Singapore prices if you stay away from the caviar :) I had the lobster linguine which was exquisite, really a full whole lobster. $68++ Also ordered the antipasti set, which gives you a sampling of 6 different appetizers. $38++ My partner had the carbonara penne, which was also very good. Authentic cheese and real high quality smoked bacon (not your ordinary kind) I think the lunch set menu is also really reasonable, I think something around $40 and looks like a good deal.","1301":"An exemplary italian fine dining restaurant. The staff service was top notch! The food was awesome! All the dishes were fine. Great place for a date and a romantic evening with awesome food!","1302":"Another example of an expats staffed restaurant surpassing Singapore in service. \u00c2\u00a0Singapore desperately needs to follow this restaurant's example of fine dining. \u00c2\u00a0(Really Singapore you don't have to tolerate being so poorly served within a restaurant - wake up). A small entrance bar- good bar service. \u00c2\u00a0Two dining rooms with plentiful, capable wait staff. \u00c2\u00a0It's good Italian (not inspiring) with an attentive wait staff. \u00c2\u00a0The place has an excellent wine menu. \u00c2\u00a0If you can afford it - dne here.","1303":"You're always guaranteed to have a pleasant experience here. Excellent food and very good service in an elegant atmosphere. For starters, I recommend splitting the 'Dream' (S188++) with a partner: so decadent but how delicious - cold angel hair pasta with prawn, oyster, scallop, uni and caviar! Having the dish on your own would be too rich for most people. Classical dishes like osso bucco and veal milanesa are prepared to perfection here; the former melts in your mouth, the latter is juicy with very light 'batter'. Pricey, but still cheaper than the top Japanese restaurants!","1304":"We dropped in as most of the eateries in our neighbourhood had closed for business by 9:30 pm - Garibaldi seems to be one of very few places open late.The staff was very friendly and courteous, we were asked to have a drink in the bar area whilst a table was set for us.When our table was ready we were taken to the main dining area which has a very calming atmosphere, with white and light coloured wood being predominant - complete with curtains to draw out the outside noises and lights. Our waiter introduced us to the set-menu, five courses with coffee, all truffle-themed for 188 S$ per person. It sounded great but we did not want to eat all that much - and spend a little less on dinner.We decided to go with half a dozen oysters (Australia & NZ), shared a scallop\/white truffles pasta starter and had pan roasted sea bass with vegetables as main.The food was delicious, the oysters fresh and very tasty, the pasta with scallops cooked to perfection and with the fresh truffle shavings just divine.The fish had a nice crispy skin and the meat was just perfect both in terms of texture and flavour.We had chosen a Sauvignon blanc\/Semillon from Australia to go with the food, which was lovely and at 88 S$ one of the cheapest choices on the extensive and expensive wine list. We found that the wine in general was overpriced but since we hadn't splurged on food for some time we decided to treat us to it - this however being the reason for 4 stars instead of five, as it really blew us away.Service was very good and professional, and consistent throughout which has become somewhat of a rarity these days, unfortunately.This place is perfect if a celebration is in order - actually there were two local parties celebrating a birthday complete with cake and candles :-).We will certainly be back some day for their excellent Italian food (the executive chef is Italian) and perfect service.","1305":"What a gem.\u00c2\u00a0 Pretty high end Italian place.\u00c2\u00a0 Pretty formal old school cooking.\u00c2\u00a0 The portions were pretty good sized.\u00c2\u00a0 The staff is responsive, the food fast, and very good.\u00c2\u00a0 I had the lamb...very good tasting.\u00c2\u00a0 However, it left my stomach upset.\u00c2\u00a0 It might have been how rich the food was, or how rare the meat was served.Wine list is great here is you have the money to spend.\u00c2\u00a0 Lots of good wines to try for any group.We had to ask for the bill. \u00c2\u00a0Service was not attentive at times.","1306":"Restaurant week dinner -appetizer. Fois gras with fusion flacked that didn't work. Pineapple compote and pandan chiffon cake bits should not appear with fois. \u00c2\u00a0+tagliatelle duck ragu. Not bad. Big portion. Expected a bit more al debate+roasted cod. V nice-dessert was an afterthought. Strange flavor combo. -decor reminds me of higher end ikea. Too modern Not sure if I'd return even if I know the chef","1307":"I went there during the Restaurant Week on 1 Nov. This is the only restaurant that live up to my expectation during this Restaurant Week experience. They really prepared their best though we were paying half the price of their normal menu.Black Ink Fettuccine was on the menu that night. It was well executed :)","1308":"A fancy place with 5-star service and delicious Italian food? Yup, that's exactly what this place is! From the moment we entered, we were greeted with a jovial waiter and a complimentary plate of cheese and olives as we waited for our table to be ready. Just a few minutes later we were guided to our table and sent a complimentary appetizer and some of the best bread I've ever had. I had the fettuccini pomodoro and my husband had the veal and mushroom ravioli. We really enjoyed both and though we won't be coming here all the time (it's a bit expensive), this spot is perfect for a romantic night out.","1309":"Garibaldi is one of my favorites. It's pricy so I don't go as often as I would like. But the food has always been very good and the service friendly and professional. This evening we decided to go with the executive dinner. 5 courses with a beautiful prosecco as an aperitif. The food was excellent as usual with new flavor combinations that were fantastic. Highly recommended for special occasions or to impress a special person.","1310":"Came here for my Birthday and had a great time! Have always known that they were famous for their food - but I've never really got the chance to come. Am glad I kept it for my Birthday!What I Loved: The decor is nice. Service is really good too. We sat at the bar area - at one of the tables - as we wanted to have drinks and finger food. The staff paid quite a lot of attention to us. I ordered an Apricot Brandy & 7-Up which was great. For our finger food, we got the Bruschetta al Pomodoro & Calamari. My fave was the dessert, Tortino Caldo al Cioccolato ($18), Molten Lava Chocolate Cake with Hazelnut Gelato & Raspberry Coulis.What I Don't Love: The prices are pretty rough though. Just finger food, 3-4 drinks & dessert came up to like $138? But it's a pretty high end place so that's expected.","1311":"Pour quoi does Garibaldi even exist? Especially when competition is rife with Gunther's down the street? Well, I went one day as Gunther's was fully reserved and AMEX concierge suggested Garibaldi. The place was 3\/4 full on a Friday night.Food \u00c2\u00a0was lackluster. Perhaps because my taste buds are not evolved enough? I can't even remember what I ate! Service was polite, swift and sterile, albeit lacking a touch of attentiveness that is expected.","1312":"This Italian restaurant is good, but oh-so-pricey. \u00c2\u00a0We enjoyed the dishes we had, extremely authentic, but small portions. The also have a huge selection of wines by the half bottles which is much appreciated and their free bread is good.But when the bill came, it was around the same price as Mozza, and it just didn't blow us away, so I think I'll head to Marina Bay Sands next time.","1313":"Garibaldi is known as one of Singapore's finest Italian restaurant and it is believable with its elegant fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and fine dining setting. The menu entices people with its authentic Italian cuisine and ingredients that have been imported from Italy. I tried 2 dishes there, both of which I am very satisfied with - Osso Buco Con Risotto (braised veal shank with saffron risotto) and Linguine with Crabmeat and Vodka Sauce. The spaghetti was marvelous, proving the high standards of this Italian restaurant as the pasta was cooked to al dente and tossed in a flavorsome tomato-based sauce with a touch of alcohol. The Osso Buco Con Risotto stole the show, with the braised veal shank so tender and succulent. The creamy and rich risotto perfectly complemented the savory veal. The standards of this restaurant are heightened by its impeccable service. The staff was warm and friendly, and not to say attentive and accommodating when taking our orders.","1314":"Fine Italian dining. Sophisticated dishes in a modern European ambience. I had the linguine with sea urchin - absolutely divine in its blend of favors, creaminess from the uni. The crackling pork was also wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0Portions are small, but that's normal for high end European dining. Impressive wine list. \u00c2\u00a0But - it's expensive, as the other reviewers note. Expect to pay $250-300 per person including good wines.","1315":"High-end modern Italian food which is yummy . \u00c2\u00a0Excellent service and nice ambience. \u00c2\u00a0On the pricey side. Good for groups and romantic dates. \u00c2\u00a0Value for money lunch sets options available for weekday. \u00c2\u00a0 My duck ragout pasta was fabulous!","1316":"You know how it goes- a colleague tells you \"hey I know a good place for lunch\", you go there, tell someone else in your workplace the same, and the next thing you know - half of the people sitting in the shop when you visit are people you're working with.This place was a regular spot for lunch given its proximity to my workplace and a pretty safe option when you have too many people who aren't very sure about what they'd like. How wrong can you go with Yong Tau Foo?I like this place for their fried things - really nice and crisp, go especially for the Yong Tau Foo skin which retains its texture even in a bowl of hot noodles (so different from the one in the Kopitiam at my workplace). It's not dirt cheap but you get a pretty good portion for what you're paying (about $4-6) and it's filling!Another gem is the bak chor mee - nowhere near the quality of places like Tai Wah High Street but still pretty good on its own (unexpectedly so actually). Okay. I keep on alternating between the laksa (which is darn good) and the BCM which have never left me disappointed! (And I've visited this place close to 10 times I think, or maybe even more).","1317":"$7.10 for barley (3 stars) and a bowl of mixed brown and yam rice with 7-10 non-meat yong tau foo ingredients was a bit too pricey given that the taste was nothing special. The only thing worth mentioning was the yam rice (4 stars) and the fact that they serve brown rice.","1318":"This a very special Yong Tao too at Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0U have got to try it then U will love it I promise ;)","1319":"Stopped here for a quick lunch - and while it's not the cheapest yong tau foo I've had, it's well worth it. The soup is savoury and tastes (not sure if MSG) authentic and deeply flavoured, and the bits of yong tau foo you select are also relatively large pieces that are surprisingly filling (especially when compared to the sort you get at typical food court stores). It's crowded, and there's a indoor and outdoor area - you pick your stuff, queue up to pay, and then the bowls get served to you. They have the usual noodle bits, as well as the more traditional yam rice. And while I usually eschew the sauces, the sweet sauce and the chilli here are both good. And if you go for that sort of thing, they have the traditional drinks like barley and sour plum (bottled, not sure if fresh).","1320":"Dinner w\/ Linda and 2 other colleagues from the Singapore team Wednesday night was definitely fun and memorable. It was my 2nd Korean BBQ experience here and I was skeptical at first because the 1st one we went to sucked severely. It was relatively empty w\/ only another party that was there. The place is small but very clean, organized, and inviting. The dinner was $27 SGD per person. Fucking cash only which is the only flaw, honestly. I liked that the drinks were also unlimited and the ice cream (w\/ waffle cones available). The meats and vegetables were held separately and it was fresh. I liked the thinly sliced beef and their spicy chicken the most. Apparently my crew and I only cared about the meats (and rice) whilst Linda's crew ate very little rice but instead, lettuce w\/ their meats. Their kimchi was spicy. I liked it. Linda insisted on paying. When I tried to give her the money the following day, she refused. She is a sweet and genuine gal. As I am typing this, I kind of wish that I did not have to fly back....","1321":"Great service and friendly cashier. You'll get to choose your coffee beans. Today it's either Columbia or Sumatra. Lots of seating available but peak time maybe tricky. The set up of very attractive and I'm just glad I chanced upon this place. It faces an entrance from the mrt station and opposite 12 cakes. Easy to locate. Keep serving!","1322":"Famous coffee chain in Singapore. The coffee here is probably one of the best among the other local chains. Their pastries are pretty good as well. A bit expensive.","1323":"Jewel coffee is pretty amazing and i'll tell you why. For a local chain with 4 branches located all over the city, it sure spark that they must've done something right that garners big following from coffee snobs, to brunch lovers to white collar workers in the CBD. This branch here in Chevron House is their third, with the first two at Rangoon Road, Little India followed by Shenton Way. The fourth branch is located in Claymore Connect Mall on Orchard Road, closer to Tanglin side. To be honest, it was my first visit after working in the CBD close to a year. Well, blame me not. We have 'bucks, Costa, Huggs, and 6oz Espresso Bar all within 5 minutes from my office. But yesterday, after a hearty meal at Omnivore (currently trying all sorts of combination before i write a through review), i decided to drop by and verify myself all the hype they've been getting. The shop is located on the ground floor of Chevron House, at the inner part, almost hidden from the main human traffic during peak hours. The cafe is directly opposite Dimbulah, another stellar cafe for artisanal teas and dessert. But let's not sway away from my first experience at Jewel Coffee. Upon walking in, i was greeted by 2 very friendly baristas dressed like a true hipster from Portland. It's a self service cafe, so i approached them and ordered a flat white. I was told Jewel Coffee only serves single origin coffee and they have 2 types currently - Simalungun from Sumatra, Indonesia and San Carlos from El Savador. I can't take anything too acidic (blame it on gastric) so the barista recommended Simalungun and I leave it to him. Now the price. It cost me $6 for a cup of flat white and i thought i;ll never come back anymore. $6 is the price i pay for a happy meal in McDonald's. But when i see the size of the coffee served, it all make sense. Jewel serves double shot and comes in 16oz mug. So you get a good amount of caffein to satisfy the craving or to fill the stomach if you're having light lunch. $6 for 16oz of double shot is pretty reasonable. I am definitely coming back one of these weekends to try out the brunch selection after reading all the glowing reviews from fellow yelpers. Or perhaps \u00c2\u00a0the venue for YUBE (Yelp Unofficial Brunch Event) so that we can try EVERYTHING!","1324":"Best coffee in the CBD by about a mile, in my view. Loses a star for the cramped cafe space and the really uncomfortable seats...","1325":"Try the tasting menu here : 1. It's good value 2. U experience the full creativity of the chefs Have been coming to this bistro more than once and love the chef's interpretation of fusion food. So creative and so delightful !Remember to bring cash or your nets card !","1326":"Arunchala bhavan is back to serving awesome food again. Tried their south indian veg meal and North Indian thali last week. Food was freshly prepared, nicely cooked and i must mention that service has improved too.","1327":"One of the only restaurant in singapore that serves good south Indian and North Indian food. Service is good. Staff is courteous. North Indian thali and South Indian meal are a hit amongst lunch goers. Quality is consistent. Overall a nice place to relish Indian food","1328":"I don't eat a lot of prawn noodle, but after trying this stall I'm reluctant to try anyone else.* Though some might find this a bit pricy ($8 for a regular size, and at most, $13 for a large size bowl with big prawns) the quality is there. I don't exactly know what goes in the broth, but it's not very watery. Rather, it has a good mix of prawn, pork, and garlic flavour. My favourite part is the bits of pork crackling that's thrown in. They are the juiciest, fattiest pieces and really make the dish. I like how you can throw in some chili\/vinegar to cut through the heavy flavours.One of my favourite outdoor stalls in SG!--*But feel free to trick me by saying \"Let's grab some chendol\" and then take me to your fave prawn noodle spot, plop a bowl in front of me, and demand that I eat it and like it OR ELSE.","1329":"My go to prawn mee store is closed for three weeks for the lunar new year, so I have to look for another shop to feed my craving for prawn mee with large prawns. Glad I took a chance to had breakfast here. The broth is very good (not as good as my usual go to shop), second best. Another plus is the fresh made crispy pork lard bits. I asked for extra and was given more than I expected. Service was good too. My sister and I only ordered one bowl as we just wanted to taste if it is good, as we had already had some breakfast at another shop down the street. The gentleman gave us two empty bowls so that we could split the food.Definitely will come back for more.","1330":"Da Dong was sold out before 12.30 p.m. the last 2 Saturdays. Today they have prawns but no pork ribs. Soup is a bit too sweet.Verdict: Nice but not great. River South (Hoe Nam) Prawns Noodles tastes better to me.","1331":"It's a total rip of for a bowl of $8 prawn noodle in Singapore with three mini shrimps and two think slick of pork . Taste is mediocre and forgettable , you can taste better one in blanco court prawn noodle in Beach road \u00c2\u00a0or the nearby prawn noodle place in Still road where $8 can give you jumbo prawn . Totally not worth to come here . Save yourself the money and time.","1332":"At 10am on a Sat, they are already fairly busy but the wait is not bad (10mins). As always their soup is excellent. We had the dry noodles and it came with some sambal premixed in the sauce. A little too spicy for kids but not so for anyone who is used to spicy food. Large portion can easily be eaten by hungry adult. Like that the shrimp are peeled and halved but not deveined.","1333":"This place has pretty darn good prawn noodles. The thing is, even though you order a large, you might end up ordering 3 bowls in total. A large isn't really a large. More like a small. Makes you wonder how big a regular size is. It's 10 dollars per bowl so it isn't really cheap compared to other hawker-like places.","1334":"Ahh, Prawn Noodles! A simple, yet beautiful dish. Located on the corner of Joo Chiat Road and Marshall Lane, Da Dong Prawn Noodles delivers one of the Best Prawn Noodles in the area, if not on the entire isling. Assessing the quality and taste of Prawn Noodles is often quite difficult. Frankly, they all have that shrimpy taste with a cooked garlic finish. In my opinion, what separates a so so prawn noodls from a fantastic one is: (i) the flavour, (ii) quality of the broth and (iii) the freshness of the prawn.Da Dong Prawn delivers all of these and more. The broth is rich in flavour and explodes in your mouth. The uncle even makes it an emphasis (a sign) that he doesn't re-fill the soup as it would dilute the flavours. Wow, that's quality. Overall, simply a fantastic prawn noodles. It is a little on the pricier side for prawn noodles, but hey, prawn noodles are a cheap comfort food anyways. :D","1335":"Arrived here at 08:45 hours . I ordered the Regular Size prawn noodles(5 sing). The aroma of prawns filled the air . One sip of this soup and WOWZERRRR's !!!!!! \u00c2\u00a0The prawn broth was soooo intense . Mix in some chili's and.......WooooHooooo, a mouth full of fireworks. Yes , it's that good. The slow braised pork ribs gave the broth its savoriness . Such a simple, but amazing dish. The regular size leaves you craving for more, but in Singapore ; there's more phenomenal foods to try. Thank you Mr. Prawn Noodle Master","1336":"I stumbled across Mellvin Coffee Shop and found that everyone was having prawn noodles. I took this as a sign that the prawn noodles must be good, so we decided to give it a try. And indeed, I think this ranks among the best prawn mee that I have had. The soup is full of flavour. The prawns were fresh and juicy. The pork slices were cooked just right.Unfortunately, I came late on a Thursday afternoon around 1.30pm and he was out of pork ribs, so it was just regular prawn mee.A small bowl is $5, a regular bowl is $8, and a large bowl is $10.We had a regular bowl of prawn mee, and although I appreciate the extra soup, I think we could have gone for the small bowl instead.He also sells prawn noodles with large prawns. They cost slightly more at $9 for a regular sized bowl.","1337":"Uncle Ah Hoi is perhaps the most dedicated specialist whose hawker fare is not the least diluted by the crowd flocking over to his stall. Previously at Farrer, he told me that he only serves what's the best, and on my first visit, recommended I have a bowl of prawn mee soup. Carpark is readily available across the coffeeshop or along the road so as I shifted my car to a proper lot, uncle prepared a bowl and then urged me to eat it quick and not worry about paying first. The first sip of the soup, I was sold and in love. The sweetness of the prawn broth with the savouriness of garlic in it makes it simple and addictive. He gives 3 pieces of prawn and slices of lean pork meat along with a regular bowl, and nothing to complain. The sign at his stall states that he cannot top up soup because it will compromise the flavour if he did that. I found it bizarre that such after such a big bowl, anyone would want more, but when I was down to my last sip, I knew I was tempted to ask for more. Priced really fairly at $5 a bowl, I am glad for the natural tasting soup, made with love from the way uncle speaks of his food.He closes on Tuesdays, but otherwise, drop by before 2pm and you should be lucky enough to get a bowl!","1338":"This is \"confirmed\" to be the best prawn noodles you can get in Singapore (my humble opinion of course). The soup is amazingly fragrant and prawns they throw in is generous i.e. big and fresh. A bit pricey but worth every cent. I always go for the big pork rib at $10. Do go early on weekends because he always sells out by 1pm.","1339":"Loved the Banana Earl Grey Tart! Gave me a hint of the dessert scene in Australia. \u00c2\u00a0It comprises of caramelized bananas which weren't overly sweet, pistachio crumbles which I like and secretly hoped for more and the earl grey mouse\/cream as you would call it was really good!You got a fan in me! The group also ordered a plate of hot wings and really liked the taste and how tender it was too! Pretty good for a first time visit to Lola. :]","1340":"Place was quite small. Not a lot of seating. Decor was cute. Customer Service could be better. On a weekday around 2 pm, there were 3 servers just standing around. Not very welcoming. Tables and seats were not properly cleaned as there were crumbs on the seats and table was wet.They did top up our water cups which was good.Egg croissant was okay. The scrambled eggs were cooked and seasoned perfect but the croissant was flaky but too soft so eggs made it soggy.Chocolate mint drink was not bad.Desserts could be better. Took a while to get it - perhaps had to wait to get it from next door sister bakery. Got the hazelnut tart and the \"hummingbird\" cake which is basically just banana bread with tiny pineapple chunks in it.Just another cafe in the area which is a nice option but nothing special.","1341":"Whoa. Is this the best espresso in sg? And at 3sgd? Yikes...Cozy trendy venue. No wifi.","1342":"Avocado eggs Benedict ($14) - 3 starsI was a bit surprised and disappointed that there was no fresh avocado - rather it was a sort of avocado smear at the bottom of the sandwich. Taste-wise nothing spectacular.","1343":"We had the Lychee Rose Water Cake. Kinda Nice.","1344":"Been here once and it was slightly after lunch so there wasn't much of a wait. Although I hear it can get quite long of a wait. The atmosphere was nice, feels a little small. I feel like the tables should be slightly wider. I had the chicken avocado salad. A whole half avocado and the chicken was okay. The dressing was a little sweet but fine. Overall a good salad. Tip: They have an iPad booking system so you can put your name down ahead of timeTip 2: it's near Kovan mrt so taking that would be better than driving as parking seems limited","1345":"The glut of cafes that opened in Singapore within the last year has left me in a spot of disconnectedness with the people who are actively involved in \"cafe-hopping\". So I did some research before heading to Lola's Cafe which was suggested by Ms K. Strangely, it seems like the entire nation is heading for the brunches instead of the dinners (perhaps the fetish for egg bens has yet to subside). One of the most tried-and-tested dishes here is the Avocado Egg Bens ($15). Nothing much astonishing about this but the excellently toasted brioche was so crunchy and ideal for mopping up the mixture of runny egg and sweet salad dressing that collected on the plate.The Honey and Paprika Wings ($10) \u00c2\u00a0were indeed so popular that customers who couldn't snap a seat, were ordering it for takeaway. Juicy and sweet, these chickens would definitely be even satisfying with more spice. The dark chocolate tart with coffee cream ($5) could be the best bet out of the three sweets we've had. Speckles of sea salt tempered the bittersweet cacao ganache within a thin chocolate tart shell, though I couldn't recall tasting baileys or espresso in the cream. Meanwhile, I failed to comprehend an Earl Grey Tart ($5) whose filling resembles mudflow. Not sure if it was intended to be of such loose consistency or to be curd-like as those of lemon meringue tarts. The Black Tea Prune Brownie with Vanilla ice cream ($7) might not win brownie points on its looks but the clever use of tea-soaked prunes injected another dimension of sweetness to an otherwise archetypical baked chocolate cake.","1346":"Came here 9:57 am, 3 min before opening. 3 girls were there. Told me: we're open at ten, kinda pushed me out and closed the door. I understand they were busy preparing, but it wouldn't hurt anyone if I wait inside for 3 min. Coffee was OK, to go cup too small. Not sure if they offer bigger. Kinda lost my interest after such \"welcoming\"","1347":"For those of you living in Kovan, you got lucky! Lola's Caf\u00c3\u00a9 has only been around for about 3 months, it surely added more liveliness to the area. This vintage caf\u00c3\u00a9 is also easily accessible - it takes you less than 5 minutes to walk from Kovan MRT (the exit opposite Heartland Mall).This caf\u00c3\u00a9 is set up by 2 young entrepreneurs, Choo Kiat and June. Besides being the boss, Choo Kiat is the chef cum barista. On the other hand, June is responsible for the pastries that you see in the caf\u00c3\u00a9. By the way, 'Lola' is actually June's middle name.This small and quaint caf\u00c3\u00a9 is filled with a variety of vintage furniture and mood lightings. I was particularly attracted to their tables - they are all made from our traditional sewing machines! Furthermore, most of the vintage furniture here are for sale - Do check them out if you'll like to add a bit of character to your room! The most unique part of the cafe is their beer menu consists of a good variety of carefully drafted beers from boutique breweries in US, UK and Belgium. I went for their Matcha Latte which costs $5.00. The latte was pretty smooth and had a sweet aftertaste. It's a little sweeter over here compared to other cafes, you might want to ask for less sugar. I also tried their Banana Earl Grey Tart ($4.00) which is one of their specialties. It's topped with a layer of sugar and pistachio nuts which tastes very crunchy. The Earl Grey paste was a little too moist though.My favourite was their Wasabi White Chocolate Mousse ($7.00). Never would I have expected wasabi to go well with white chocolate! An exotic mix of ingredients, it's a surprising recipe and very delicious! Don't worry about the spiciness of the wasabi; it's very gentle and not too overwhelming. The sweetness of the white chocolate complements the overall taste and it melts in your mouth! It's so unique I can't describe it with words. You have to try it for yourself!Lola's cafe is very conducive for reading and for studying. You could also reward yourselves with some savoury desserts while working your brain cells! It's also a good place to hang out with your friends in the late evenings over some beer and honey wings. Service was great, staff were all very friendly. I will certainly come back again to try out their brunch and beers!P.S: This cafe is free of GST and Service Charge!","1348":"Had the truffle toast which is great, and honey paprika wings which was average. Good cafe but not really worth the wait. Would be better if they had the pastas that \"on the table\" have.","1349":"Very surprised about this cafe. The menu is designed to capture the late and lazy people who gets up really late and missed breakfast but It too early for lunch, hence brunch.","1350":"Kovan is becoming a hipper place for people living in the North East! I know we have Serangoon Gardens and all but that area is seriously too congested for my liking. Recently, the brothers and i checked out Lola's Cafe, a fairly new joint located at Simon Road, just a stone's throw away from our regular Punggol Nasi Lemak haunt (i don't like it btw). Lola's Cafe is a cheerful cafe with a limited seating capacity. I reckon it sits about 20 to 30 pax. And they are really popular. Go early, put your booking down on the iPad booking system and be prepared to wait.I've heard good things about the brunch menu (available from 10am - 3pm on weekends) but i've yet to try it. Friends that i've sent in Lola's way enjoyed the Avocado Eggs Benedict very much. All my favorite ingredients in 1 dish, you bet i'd order that next time.We met late for supper and picked from the bites section. The Truffle fries with grated Parmesan cheese ($12) was MEH. I'm a fan of soggy fries but this style is simply not compatible with truffle oil. The fries were bland and lacking in the truffle aroma.My favorite is the Honey and Paprika Crispy Wings ($9). You have to order this! This is an order from the Tummy Ministry. I loved the light crispy batter which stayed crunchy throughout the meal. The meat was nicely marinated and went perfectly with the light touch of honey which coats it.Their homemade desserts are apparently quite popular here but both desserts that we tried were less than satisfactory. The Dark Chocolate Sea Salt tart with Kahlua coffee cream ($5) sounded more delicious than it tasted. Filling to tart ration was off (too much tart) and the tart lacked in the butter department and was simply too crumbly (and i don't mean it in a good way). The tart tasted like one of those factory manufactured pastry shells. Meh. Sticky Honey Apple cake with French Vanilla ice cream ($7). According to the brothers, who aren't very picky with food, \u00c2\u00a0Swensen's apple crumble tastes better and i concur. I had the Matcha green tea latte ($6) which was worse than Starbucks. It was terribly bland. Will never order this again.I was hoping that i would be head over heels in love with Lola's Cafe but i wasn't. Hopefully their brunch will change my opinion about them. Till then.","1351":"Went back again that night as planned...Their Iced Latte is realllllly good, and so is the lemon meringue tart. Then again, I do love all things lemon meringue.Also, consistently good service. On Edge waiter was less on edge, so that's a plus. :)","1352":"Went to Lola's with a friend last night, and let me tell you, I'm definitely going back there again. TONIGHT.1) Had their Fish & Chips as well as Mushroom Truffle Cream Spaghetti. The chips were good, and the cream sauce was perfection. Really good comfort food. Didn't get to try their dessert except for the Banana earl grey tart thingy, which was aight . Got my dad the Hazelnut chocolate bar for dinner and he said it was good.. (I didn't hear any screaming\/cursing\/life affirmating shouts of joy so I'm gonna assume it's just your normal chocolate nomz.)2) Coffee was good. Not the kind that makes me want to kill someone ( whut? I take my coffee seriously.) Also, their Iced Latte is one of the better ones.3) The ambience was AMAZING. Best decor hands down. For me it's pretty much on par with Drury lane. I have a thing for wooden furniture, kayy.4) No GST and no service charge.... soooooo.. leave a tip! :) Didn't quite like the service from onee of the staff. He seemed...very much on edge the poor guy. Oddly enough the trainees\/newer staff were more friendly. 5) I seriously ADORE the place and the crowd, they seemed really quiet and peaceful happy people. So yes. My new regular haunt. Whenever I have the time.","1353":"I do not understand why on earth do people queue up for 2 hours for this? Yes the fries are good, the wings favorable, but other than that, i didnt find anything worth going back for. The service staff were great though! Despite being shorthanded, were able to keep the queue and diners under control.","1354":"Quality was worth the money. However, taste was lacking the punch and resulted in unsatisfactory meal. Both types of pasta were soaked in sauce although the serving was very generous. Definitely recommend their nachos fries and pulled pork burger, they were SUPER DELICIOUS!! I love what they have done with the buns. Unlike the usual toasted, it's baked until shiny golden brown. I was sold for its' presentation. Thumb down for the chocolate tart though, it wasn't the ending I had hope to have. It's worth the first try, but not convinced to visit for the second time.","1355":"Awesome place. Great food, great staff. I live right around the corner and would go all the time, but because its the best place in Kovan its always packed. Ive only eaten there a few times over the last year, cause when I want to eat, I rarely have enough time to get a table. Its very rare to see the wait time to be less than 90 mins. But if you have the time, and aren't busy, Lola's is as good as it gets in Kovan. Take away is always an option, but they have a great beer selection, so sticking around is better, if possible.","1356":"One of the best cafe that I've tried so far. Downside is the waiting time ard 2 hrs or more.","1357":"neighborhood hipster-type cafe with pretty food and mostly decent flavors - this I would rank amongst the middling ranks of hipster joints.is it a sign of age that I can't seem to abide bad service these days? I'm not quite fastidious (but of course it's not something one just admits to), but the number of untrained staff that I've encountered at new eating places is baffling: is it me, or is it them? this place was staffed primarily by students - young, and not quite well-trained - something I expect we'll see more often now that school's out and they make for low-cost labor, especially with these small cafes.when you do sit down (not so implicitly implying a wait), the food is decent. it's not the best cooking, but good-enough renditions of brunchy egg dishes and fried breakfasts. the portions are reasonably-sized, too, so you won't leave hungry.the draw of the place are their tarts - and some are really pretty good. we had the lime meringue, banana earl-grey brulee and salted chocolate tartlets (in order of increasing appeal) - tiny and adorable and thankfully tasty in fluted butter crusts.stay away from the nutella tart though, for it had a strangely jellyish filling that tasted barely of that dark brown magic - insubstantial both in flavor and taste. I have a weakness for nutella (eataly, won't you open here please?) and so my expectations were highest for this slice, and consequently most deflated. spreading a thick layer of the spread would have sufficed, really.in short, adequately decent and great as a neighborhood cafe - but it's not a destination worth too much effort in travel. although.. that salted chocolate tart might just about singlehandedly make a good enough point to visit.","1358":"It had been quite awhile since I last visited the place. The menu had changed alot from what I last had. Besides the bar bites, the place also offers brunch menu during the weekend. It was recommended that reservation had to be made as the place get crowded during weekends. The place was easy to find as it was just a street away from the MRT station.The place was decorated in dark industrial look way. Although there was no service charge on the bill, there was GST on the bill. Remember to help yourself to the ice water on the shelf.COFFEE BALLER ($8.50+)Macadamia Flavoured Espresso Ice Ball served with warm milkBeware of the hot milk when pouring into the glass. It was a refreshing drink to have and one could adjust the richness of the drink to own's taste.Katsuo Butter Sprouts ($12+)Brussel Sprouts, Katsuo Butter, Roasted AlmondsIt looks simple, but it was filled with sweet, juicy, and nutty texture.Mac & Cheese Refined ($10+)Emmental, Cheddar, Mozzarella Cheese, Crispy BreadcrumbsBest had it while it was still hot and moist, else it became quite hard and dry. It was a cheese lover's favourite.The Refinery Zhng Burger EVM ($18+)Crispy Double Chicken Cutlets, Slow-Grilled Brioche Burger Buns, Overdose of Signature Refinery Salted Egg Sauce, Served with Truffle Fries.This item was available only for 3 July. I got to know about it when I saw the picture of it on instagram the day before. The dish took quite awhile to arrive. The truffle fries smelt great with the truffle oil smell, and was dry and crispy. The chicken cutlet was big in size, but would be better if it was a bit more juicy and overflowed with more sauce. I like my burger juicy and dripping with sauce.The salted egg sauce that served with it, was thick and rich, more like a paste.Overall the food was not bad. The place was crowded but not too noisy.","1359":"It's okay...Nothing to write home about. I like the place more than the food. If you work around the area, it's s nice place to hang out after work. If not, don't bother with the hike to the area.","1360":"The food here is Yums but the service leaves you wanting. Coffee here is just alright. I especially love the salted egg yolk custard sauce on onion rings. So awesome!What's not bad:- beef rice bowl. Tasty - fried cauliflower- big breakfast. Huge portions- mantou sliders. Also very generousThe poutine should definitely be improved. The sauce isn't saucy enough. And the cheese not squeaky or generous enough to be called a poutine. Don't put onions in the poutine please. It's just wrong! Very affordable. \u00c2\u00a0Casual dining. Will be back for sure.","1361":"The place is 10 mins walking distance from lavender mrt. There are crowd. The aircon is strong enuff and blowing on face. I like the truffle fries that comes with the burger. The salted egg yolk source is like a paste. I didn't find it special. It was served seperately in a small disposable plastic container. The plain water is free. It would taste better with slices of lemon in the water. Free one cannot complain. :)Katsuo Butter Sprout is nice with almond sprinkled on top. I like the taste as it is sweet and well cooked.","1362":"I really, really, really wanted to like this place, I did.Unfortch, neh.I've walked past this place a few times, and the place was always crowded on a Friday night, with great decor, projecting the sort of cool hipster vibe, and with a cool name like The Refinery, I felt myself drawn to this place because I like to pretend I'm a hipster sometimes.Alas! I was so disappointed. Everything about this place is great except the food. I will not comment on the cocktail bar on top that is part of this set-up as I didn't drink that night. On hindsight, I ought to have drank to dull my senses.I had a multitude of items which were a hodgepodge of Japanese\/local fusion, and I wasn't impressed. Would I come back? Not even if it was free.","1363":"Having tried some of the other restaurants in Arap street we are pleasantly surprised to discover this restaurant for authentic Turkish food in Singapore. We found the adana kebab and pides to be of the best quality. The dessert kunefa was particularly delicious. Waiter was very kind and offered us free Turkish tea. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.","1364":"Nothing exceptional. It's a small restaurant, the location is off the side of the main street, service was decent, a little robotic. Food was also ok, but lots of places much better in the neighborhood. Also, halal, so no booze.","1365":"I love the whiff of spices in the air as I stroll through Arab street each time. I decided to try Istanblue today:1) cacik - yogurt mixed with cucumber, lemon juice, mint and garlic + pita bread2) al nazik chicken3) lentil soupI must say that I enjoyed all the above dishes. The Chili Oil in the al nazik reminded me in Sze Chuan-ese cuisine, which I was pleasantly surprised by. It went really well with the eggplant dip and freshly toasted pita bread. The lentil soup was similarly a tad spicy and definitely packed with flavour. I appreciated that the cacik wasn't too sour. It was a nice dish to start the meal with as it was very refreshing. I would recommend getting a pot of peppermint tea as the pot is pretty and holds heat well, and more importantly, it is a comforting pot of tea!","1366":"I've been to a number of the popular Astons' outlets (which really feels like they remade \"Jack's Place\") , but this one is my favourites. Astons is known for it's extremely reasonably priced Western food. 1) It's not as crowded as the Cathay outlet for which there is ALWAYS a queue2) The service is MUCH better than the East Coast Road outlet. A little more on the service - the manager who seated us was chatty and friendly, and gave us spectacular service. He gave us a corner booth when I went there with my date for privacy, haha, and waited on us like it was a 5-star restaurant. That made a lot of difference.3) Food - the quality of food at all Astons outlets I've tried seem to be quite across the board . The salmon is quite good. \u00c2\u00a0The focus here is on the steak (which sorry, I didn't try). The soup was sub-par.","1367":"My parents and I ate here lunch earlier this month while we were seeing the famous lion.The food is very good and definitely upscale.It has an amazing view of the bay.","1368":"Right by the Merlion Park, the restaurant provide the spectacular view of Merlion and Marina Bay Sands while dining at this place.We walked in on Sunday around 6pm without any reservation, and we got lucky to get a great corner table inside. \u00c2\u00a0(it was still warm outside and we wanted to be in air conditioned room although patio provides better view of the MBS.We started our dinner with a bottle of red wine. We were a little disappointed by the selection of wine listed under premium wine. \u00c2\u00a0We also ordered a bottle of sparking water to help ease spicy food later.Cucumber salad with garlic was crunchy yet tender. \u00c2\u00a0Fresh cumber mixed with red chili and garlic sauce was very good, after we finished eating cucumbers, we kept the sauce to use it later for other dishes.Asparagus appetizer was cooked well and it also went good with the chili garlic sauce we kept from the cucumber salad earlier.Steamed Sea bass was so moist and tender, sauce used to flavor the fish went really well with sea bass. \u00c2\u00a0In fact, we ate every edible parts of the fish. \u00c2\u00a0The fish was that good.We also had their famous chili crabs. They were good but it seems like all chili crabs taste the same. We'd had chili crabs from other restaurants in Singapore, and I thought all I had so far tasted the same. \u00c2\u00a0Since the chili crabs were a little spicy for me, we ordered several buns to ease my spiciness in my mouth. \u00c2\u00a0We were trying to stay away from carbohydrates but this bun was so yummy, I ended up eating 3 of them. \u00c2\u00a0Eating chili crabs brought back so many good memories I spent in Singapore in the past. I think I had chili or black pepper crabs at almost every visit to this country. \u00c2\u00a0Must have in Singapore, right?Service was excellent. \u00c2\u00a0The server exchanged serving plates for each dish. \u00c2\u00a0When we started eating chili crabs, she kept coming back with more wet towels and more plates to keep our table and hands as clean as possible.When we finished eating, we were very pleased with the quality of food served here.Free WiFi here - ask the server for password","1369":"Right on the water front, its one of my families favourites to book to watch the fireworks! I've been here on National Day and also on NYE and the view watching the fireworks over the river is to die for! The food here is good quality, nice service and great location. Who doesn't love Asian 5 - 12 course meals!? I LIVE FOR THEM. I'm so grateful everyday to be half Chinese.From what I remember from the times I've eaten here nothing on the menu stood out as being bad - everything was delicious and the staff were very accommodating in changing around a few dishes when we called about menus etc. For views of the fireworks (or in general as well, a nice place to bring tourists!) this place is a winner!On regular nights there is a little light show that happens as well - nothing big but just telling you .. it's there. I think its coming down from MBS? I'm not too sure but .. just to let you know!","1370":"Over rated, over priced! Whilst the view is spectacular, I am here to have a nice dinner, not pay a King's ransom for very ordinary food. You be the judge. Half a roast chicken, some stir fried mixed vegetables and a small steamed fish with 3 bowls of rice came to Singapore $205\/-. See my pictures. Is it any wonder the restaurant was empty! It will not do well if it persist in charging such exorbitant prices for really very ordinary food. It was Saturday night and the restaurant was empty! You wonder why.","1371":"View while eating outside couldn't be beat, along with no reservations and being able to be seated quickly was a plus! the chili crab, kobe beef over charcoal cooked at your table, and steamed fish were all amazing! service was also wonderful, however the price was quite steep.","1372":"Nice place, the ambient is quite refined and the cuisine is what I'd describe as \"fusion\" between Chinese and European. If you are looking for something different it might be a place worth checking out!","1373":"The atmosphere, the service and the food was amazing! I enjoyed the seafood curry very much! The scallops along with the giant prawns melted in my mouth and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice to it. The fried buns that accompanied the dish were not too much and perfect for dipping in the sauce.I also had the durian crispy ice cream for dessert, it was so creamy and delicious and not overly sweet.I would definitely recommend and return here!","1374":"Very nice ambience. \u00c2\u00a0But that's where it ends. \u00c2\u00a0The food was very average, the service average and the price was so over the top that our group spent the evening trying to justify the bill. \u00c2\u00a0Go only if you like a view and have money you don't care to donate for an average meal.","1375":"If you're a fan of Chef Yong at Majestic, you'll like his second restaurant at One Fullerton called Jing. I had a few lunch meetings here last year and the food was memorable. So much so that I can wax lyrical despite having eaten tons of over the top Cantonese meals as a Cantonese daughter. My love for Cantonese food only extends to good soups, zi char and modern Cantonese fine dining. I loathe eating the traditional 8 course parade of abalone, braised vegetables yaaawn. Hence Jing by reputation was already on my good books.Jing has a modern feel to it, with a gold and moss green scheme offsetting the brown flooring. The private room I've dined in is spacious and has good acoustics so you're not craning your neck to hear the presenter at the opposite end of the table. The contemporary aesthetic pervades the menu, which Chef Yang (formerly from Pine \u00c2\u00a0Court) sending out some familiar Cantonese dishes with a modern twist. The perennial Peking duck ( I still haven't figured out why Cantonese restaurants serve Peking duck) skin is served with pan seared foie gras and caviar, which tastes incredibly rich compared to the watermelon and foie gras at Majestic. As I am against killing sharks for their fins, I thought the use of sharks bones for soup both maximized the lost of life and produced a wonderful deep, milky broth. The crispy fried fish with soy sauce was very fresh and had great texture, while the crystal prawns were equally fresh, crunchy and evenly coated with wasabi mayo. To end the meals, lobster noodles was in order and trust me, you will not regret ordering these noodles done to perfection, despite what I imagine to be a pretty hefty price tag. The cream of avocado dessert with coconut or vanilla ice cream is also unusual yet refreshing. In all, you won't go very wrong bringing family or work meetings to this restaurant.","1376":"If you've ever ordered popiah in a hawker stall and said to yourself \"I sure would like to try and make that myself\", well guess what? You can! Here at Good Chance Popiah you can hone your popiah wrapping skills and get to eat your creations. They're not $1.50 a roll like in the stalls but hey, you gotta pay a little extra for the novelty of it all. I'm guessing about 2.5x more ... not bad. The popiah ingredients are fresh and I think perfectly portioned to make the amount ordered. Topping up on a particular filling will have an extra charge. It's fun to roll and eat your own popiah. The menu also has other dishes like noodles, bean curd, veggies, and so on. Service was very attentive and if you don't know what else to order other than the popiah, the staff is more than happy to make some recommendations. So roll yourself outta bed, roll yourself to Good Chance, and roll yourself some popiah.","1377":"This is my first time at a self-wrapped popiah place and I love it! Good for fussy popiah eaters like me who do not like garlic (YUCKS) and lard in my popiahs. We ordered the small popiah set which came with 6 popiah skins, a big pot of filling as well as coriander, egg, garlic, chili (go easy on this, it's spicy) , lettuce and bean sprouts on the side. Bottles of sweet sauce and ground peanuts were also provided. We also ordered the hokkien mee and baby kalian. Hokkien mee was good - noodles weren't too soggy and there was roast pork which added a nice flavor. Baby kalian came almost half an hour later than the popiahs after multiple rounds of chasing. Not cool since the restaurant was almost empty (only one other table occupied). A fun place to eat at cos you can laugh at your friends' popiahs. Mine looked really sad plus it burst when I held it. Boo... guess I'm not fated to be a popiah \"chef\".","1378":"First, I'm a popiah fan. Second, I enjoy DIY popiahs or those from the hawker center. And, when it comes to DIY, am so glad that Good Chance Popiah offers their locations for folks like myself to come to. \u00c2\u00a0The popiah skins are superb, the filling and quality just right, and the condiments all there for your choosing. \u00c2\u00a0We also had the flash fried tofu cubes (super tasty).. And we left stuffed. \u00c2\u00a0There is an incremental higher cost \"per popiah\" than going to a hawker center ... but the setting, to me, is worth it, especially if you're congregating as a family or group of folks just wanting a comfortable (air-conditioned) locale offering large round tables to mutually enjoy being together as part of the prep\/dining experience.And the three ladies servicing the room were very attentive and helpful. Great hospitality all around!","1379":"This has to be one of my favorite dimsum buffet places. It's slightly pricey at about $70+ per person after taxes, but so well worth it.We had Sunday brunch here and definitely have to make a booking as this place is IN DEMAND. You come here, order what you like from the menu (no cranky old ladies pushing carts), and have a dimsum binge. Oh! I started with the pumpkin soup - I think I had 3 helpings. My favorite appetizer was the deep-fried almond prawns, which had roe and wasabi sauce on top. Making me so hungry right now.The roast meats are absolutely delightful too, though I felt portions were a bit tiny, probably so we could try more things. Consistently good, would return, and starve myself before I come here again!","1380":"A+ for service and decor. \u00c2\u00a0B+ for food. \u00c2\u00a0We ordered the siu mai, har gow, cod dumplings, waygu dumplings and seafood congee. The plainest most boring looking dish was the congee and it was really good. \u00c2\u00a0I fancy myself a bit of a congee connoisseur having eaten it in many countries\/cities and the congee here ranks in the 25 percentile or so. From there it's kind of all downhill. \u00c2\u00a0Not to say they were bad but the rest of the dishes were kinda like meh... I could have had like 3 dishes for the price of 1 back in LA and it'd be around as good. \u00c2\u00a0Overall it's a good restaurant and a nice high end experience (if not a bit rushed)... but in a city with so many options it's hard to recommend.","1381":"4.5 stars. Excellent dim sum buffet in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. This is the buffet type where you sit and order from a menu and they serve you (as opposed to having a buffet line). Not cheap at S$68\/pax but I think it's good value for money given the quality of ingredients. You could order dim sum, cooked dishes as well as dessert (all included).We find the cooked dishes standard good like what you would expect from an upscale Chinese restaurant but the dim sum were excellent, in particular the Kurobuta char siew pao and siew mai. Desserts were ok.","1382":"I wanted to do something a bit special with Hubby when we visited Singapore so I decided to book Cherry Garden restaurant for dim sum buffet. It literally combines the two best things together: dim sum and buffet. Hubby was so excited for it and we even arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened for trading. We went for the first seating that started at 11 AM.The restaurant was quite grandeur and calm at the same time. The dark wooden furniture gave a very classy feel to the whole restaurant. Hubby and I were used to the bustling dim sum carts and noisy tables. I think it was quite calm because there were only a few people that morning. We quite enjoyed the warm and luxurious atmosphere at Cherry Garden. Yes, there wasn't any dim sum carts rolling around the place that morning. We ordered what we wanted off the buffet menu through the friendly staff. Our tea pot always got refilled promptly by them too. The menu also consists of soup & appetisers, desserts and other hot Chinese dishes (rice, congee, noodles, seafood, meat, vegetables).We started off with something light so we ordered the rice congee and a serving of hot and sour soup. The rice congee came with the century egg and shredded pork while the hot and sour soup contained a good amount of seafood in it. Both items look small in the photo but the size of the serving bowl was actually really good. We really enjoyed our deep fried Chinese-bun that came with chilli crab meat sauce. It was so yummy and if there wasn't any time limit on the buffet I'd just sit there and keep on ordering this dish (heheh).We ordered quite a few dishes from the dim sum selection such as chicken feet in black bean sauce, pork siew mai with baby abalone, juicy pork xiao long bao, and the yummy deep-fried escargot dumplings. I never seen or heard of any escargot dumplings before so we decided to order it. It was a sweet and creamy surprise! The Kurobuta char siew bao had a really fluffy exterior and juicy sweet meats on the inside.We really liked how the serving is suited for the number of people in your group. As it was only me and hubby, they gave us a small serving of the braised beef fillet. The beef was really tender and juicy.We really enjoyed our brunch at Cherry Garden and looking forward to go back there again next time we're in Singapore. The dim sum costs SGD $68 per person and there are two seatings available: 11 AM to 1 PM or 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. It's definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion as well although you might want to book in advance for weekend or public holiday seating.","1383":"Considering this restaurant has earned a Michelin star, we had high hopes for our dining experience at Cherry Blossom, however it unfortunately fell very short on our expectations and we left feeling very disappointed. FOOD - We did not select one of their pre-fixe menus, but instead opted for ordering multiple family-style items as suggested by our waiter. We ordered the Peking duck, scallops, pan seared chicken, fried rice, and wasabi prawns. The food was mediocre at best, aside from the Peking duck - which was quite delicious and I would come back for only that. The other items were nothing special, and certainly not \"Michelin-Star\" quality in our opinion (and we're experienced Michelin Star diners).SERVICE - What a disappointment! For this caliber of a restaurant we were extremely dissatisfied with the waitstaff. \u00c2\u00a0While our courses came out promptly, our table was constantly left with dirty plates for sometimes up to 10 minutes after we had finished eating. Disgusting. We also ended up pouring our own wine several times since the servers did not seem to notice our empty glasses despite how many times they walked by. Unacceptable. The waitstaff was nice but very inattentive to us even though the restaurant was not that busy and we were seated next to the hosts stand. This was another annoyance in itself. Upon arriving we were seated at the table right next to the host stand and entrance - in other words, the worst table in the house. It had no atmosphere and it barely even felt like we were dining in the restaurant. Considering it was 7:45 and the restaurant was less than half full, we requested a different table but were told \"they were completely booked\". By the end of our meal, the restaurant had only became more empty, and there were PLENTY of open tables, so this was quite annoying. Our experience was so disappointing overall we skipped desert and opted to leave early. For a Michelin-Starred restaurant, they have A LOT of areas to be improved.","1384":"This was our favorite restaurant of our Singapore trip and we are avid foodies. To start, the service was the best we've ever experienced - from pulling out our chairs, constantly refilling water & tea, and the kind and friendly attitude of all the servers. Sabrina is the BEST! We ordered the prawns appetizer, the kurobota pork, and the mixed garlic vegetables. I have celiac disease and they clearly mark gluten free options on the menu. Each dish was crafted with care, and the ingredients were extremely fresh. The presentation was fantastic. We finished everything and were tempted to order even more at the end because we enjoyed it so much. The ambiance is beautiful, with calm music and amazing Cantdecor. They even brought out a dessert surprise for our anniversary! Highly recommend this gem of a place - it was the only restaurant that truly impressed us in every aspect. We will be back every time we return to Singapore.","1385":"This was our favorite restaurant of our Singapore trip and we are avid foodies.

Only non-convenient is no restroom there.","1387":"A nice dinner in a nice restaurant with really nice n helpful service. The ambiance is nice, the Chinese foods they're serving is Cantonese but judging from the rice soup with pork that they served, I think it's more to Hokkien style porridge. But, I'm no expert to the Chinese food. The cod fish with vegetables and pumpkin soup also very nice. We tried the lobster soup which also very nice. Portions were small and just enough for one person. Price wise this restaurant is moderate. Some food's selection can be very expensive too. Next time I'll try their lunch :-)","1388":"The location of one of our more recent Yelp brunches, Cherry Garden was in truth, a little disappointing.I've been here for dinner, and one thing that is really top-notch is the service. They really commit to delivering excellent service and deserve due recognition.I enjoyed dinner more than the brunch buffet, mainly because the star of the buffet, the dim sum, was more lose-sum than win-sum.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of variety, and some very unique selections. The custard bun with chocolate was to me, just delicious. Not too sweet, super rich chocolate filling that other people at the table made rather unflattering analogies with, I was more than happy to eat two.The cooked items such as the pork, duck, and other seafood items and meat were definitely of an excellent standard, and probably stole the show. It's only a pity that there's a limit on how many of certain items you can order because they cost more.The soups were... alright. I wouldn't describe them as bland, but they weren't any better than something you'd order at Soup Restaurant. Overall, while the value for the buffet brunch is undeniable (particularly if you're a bottomless pit comme moi), but I think the quality of the dinner menu is far superior. A good compromise? Go for the buffet, but aim for the cooked items. That's where all the delicious lurks.","1389":"I spent two years in Hong Kong so yes I'm picky about my dim sum. And I've also always been incredibly disappointed with the dim sum offerings in Singapore. Even back home in Melbourne there were better options than here.Cherry Garden is the one exception. I will admit that I feel as if the standard has dropped a little since I first came here. But it's still the best dim sum I've ever had in Singapore.Their dim sum brunch deal is good value for all you can eat. There are a few mis-steps, eg. the skin on the har gau is too thick, the fried tentacles are bland and the hot & sour soup also lacks punch.But there are also a lot of hits. The char siu bao is very well executed, the loh bak guo is in the Singapore hawker style rather than the Cantonese dim sum style but tastes excellent, and I highly recommend the wasabi mayo prawns.Service is professional and polite and the restaurant is a fairly comfortable one to sit in.","1390":"Our experience at Cherry Garden was a polished one from beginning to end. It was a little on the pricey end but we did eat a number of delicacies and receive impeccable service. Their ability to adapt their traditional dishes to be gluten free was done with a can-do attitude and at the end of the night our waiter came over and gave me a fresh long stemmed rose to keep. A sweet gesture that brightened up our hotel room for the duration of our stay.","1391":"Maybe my expectations for this place was too high. I went with my taiwanese friends who were in town, and they wanted to go due to high reviews on trip advisor. The general consensus was a \"meh\". Sure, it's a buffet, for a relatively affordable price, but the items are, in my humble opinion, not as tasty as say Imperial Treasures or Crystal Jade dining in. It was oooookay, but nothing blew me away. The soups were a little bland, and the various dumplings were somewhat well, buffet standard. Definitely not coming back.","1392":"Why does Singapore work for gluttons like me? Oh yeah, the endless buffets. It's only fitting I post a SG review for a Chinese buffet... it harkens back to the good ole days of yore, when I willingly posted about my piggy-ventures on the east coast. But the difference lies in the standards of this a la carte buffet of Cherry Garden. This place is good. And by good, I mean goooooooood. Order as many of those little juicy bite-size delicacies of dim sum as you want, and it arrives steaming hot ready to be scooped up and chomped on. Shrimp fillings are surprisingly plump and springy, and the dumpling skin is not too thick (okay, not super thin, but willing to overlook this small fact). If an overload of dumplings isn't enough to satisfy your weekend hangover, top it up with a choice of soup, meat, fish and vegetable dishes-- and even dessert! (I recommend the refreshing watermelon aloe dessert in all its liquid nitrogen foggy goodness). Does this food far exceed any Chinese buffet I've ever experienced back home? Um, yes.The price is only marginally more than you would pay for any normal dim sum excursion, so is it worth it? Um, yes. Have I gone more times than I can possibly admit on a public forum and not seem ridiculous? Um, yes.","1393":"Weekend dim sum brunch here is as good as it get i.e. on par with any of the other famous dim sums you can think of. Ambiance here is excellent to give you a comfy feel. Do try out their crispy wasabi-aioli prawns with fresh mango and roe.","1394":"With all the hotpot choices in Singapore we decided to try Beauty in the Pot. Our decision was based on proximity to the Mandarin Orchard Hotel and the fact they offer a collagen soup base. They offer a variety of soup bases so we tried 4:1. Collagen 2. Spicy 3. Cooling coconut 4. Medicinal chicken They all were delicious but I must say their collagen specialty was the best. We had too many items to list but we stuck with the basics: beef, lamb, enoki mushrooms, spinach, tofu puffs, pork balls, fired bean curd (tofu sheets fired to a golden crisp) and moreThey had a sauce bar as well and was $4\/pax extra. I personally think for th price we payed this should have been included.Coming from Vancouver where we have a plethora of hot pots, this one did stand out a little with the collagen broth. Give them a try (and ask for Gabriel who was an excellent server - tell him I sent you :)","1395":"Famous local hot pot chain - very difficult to book on Fridays\/weekends so would recommend doing so in advanceQuality of ingredients and the selection available here is excellent. Favorites include the premium beef, the fried tofu, the creative meatballs, fishThere are many broths to choose from. We ordered the classic collagen soup and the spicy Mala - both are great.Like Haidilao, you make your own sauces though they do offer some suggestions. At the end, they serve very good iced fruit juiceGood attentive service","1396":"Yummy steamboat with fresh ingredients! The collagen soup is so good! The other soup bases are also good: drunken chicken and coconut soup. Fresh ingredients and good quality. Friendly staff and great service! Variety could be better and items tend to be sold out if you go late at night. The price value could be better. It's pretty pricey for the amount of food. There is 20% discount after 10:30 PM! There is always a line during the day (even weekdays) until 9 PM so make sure you line up early or try to make reservations (if they ever pick up your call).","1397":"Total bill came up to $172 for 4 of us - that's $43 per person, which I thought was way overpriced for a meal that largely consisted of various types of fish cake. We only ordered one plate of beef (the one that wasn't the US beef), which was too tough, thick and somehow fatty, and no seafood or dumplings. We ordered two soups - the tomato and the collagen ones. The meal was mediocre - 3 stars at most - and I deducted one star for the price.The beancurd skin and la mian were the better dishes. Not coming back again if I can help it.","1398":"Yummy collagen pot with exemplary service attitude by every staff! My best pick includes : homemade fish tofu and crispy tofu skin I definitely recommend for you to try twin or even quard pot so that you won't get bored with only 1 broth:) the drunken chicken broth and collagen was a good mix IMO","1399":"My friends and I are HOOKED to this place. We especially LOVE hotpot BUT the broth here is on another level. We used to go to other location which is in Katong, too, but the broth quality there had gone down the drain. So.. this is the most consistent location we know. And by consistent, I mean that the soup is always of the same quality (never diluted) when it's served (before you added the extra ones from the bottles, of course).The most common broths that people get are the Ma La and Collagen. I personally love the collagen one so much and recommend everyone to order at least that one when they first come to visit. For the Ma La, it's really hot and this place definitely does the kick. There's also a large selection of ingredients to create your own sauces that you can mix n match to dip in your items. My friends usually mix some of the ingredients together for their tangy, spicy or garlicky sauces. In addition, they also provide fruits to end your meal. Some of the drinks are refillable and my favorite is the sweet & sour one.After you finish your meal, they tend to give you a small cup of sweetness to wash down your meal with as (or before) you pay along with free wet tissues. No spoilers, but this is a place to constantly experience especially on a cold day with your loved one; that's my bowl of happiness.On a side note, bookings are required especially on the weekend and there's always 20% OFF from 10:30pm onwards everyday.","1400":"I cannot say enough good things about this place - I am HOOKED. We had 4 broths for a group of 4 girls, and got the coconut, collagen, clear chicken and spicy mala-like soup. I personally did not like the mala soup as it had an herb that left a very funny feeling in my mouth, but the the collagen and chicken soups were ON ANOTHER LEVEL. It was so good! The sauces you can mix and make yourself are a nice touch. Fish glue, meat platter, and fried tofu skins are my favourites, and the fact that the waitresses tell you cooking times for each items and constantly refill your drink is something we appreciated very much.","1401":"It was quite a hot day and I was feeling for something cold and not too heavy. The place was relatively quiet at 2.30pm on weekday, with just a couple of customers. The place was known for its poke bowls, but I decided to go for its Superfood Smoothie Bowls which had 4 selections at $6 each.Maca Nutter Base - Banana, raw maca, soy milk. Toppings - Coconut & dark chocolate drizzle, pomegranate, dark chocolate shavings, roasted cashews.It was quite refreshing and smooth, except for the frozen pieces of banana in the base. I like the feel of the burst of pomegranate in the mouth.","1402":"Oh my goodness this place has good poke! It tastes a little better than it does in the US. The food has a really good quality that you can only see in Singapore. I know poke is still new in Singapore and I have to say they did a really good job of making my order. After you pick your base you can get the same ingredients that you see in an American poke joint. If you are a hardcore addict of poke you can add the premium ingredients for an extra cost. Here they have drinks and won't overcharge you no matter what you get. I love the smoothie they have. Tastes real authentic and is perfect for lunch.It's a place where many millennial can have a work or school break. The staff here is real happy and really care for the customer. Getting a to go is good as well because you can pair it with some Milo. The price is good if you are an US tourist. Come here whether you are a poke fan or not","1403":"Delicious poke however, wished the bowl could be bigger. It's difficult to eat as the rice are all the way to the bottom and when you try to grab a spoonful, toppings will just fall over. Service there are so so to me only. Not great but not bad either.","1404":"There was a groupon deal and hence one of my church mate suggested that we come here to celebrate our birthdays.Stepped in around 1.30pm on a Saturday. The dining area were half filled with customers and hence we were able to choose to sit on a high chair or normal seating arrangements. Personally, I have not had poke bowls ever since I stepped out of California. Hence this make-your-own bowl concept was intriguing especially with the vast varieties of items that you could add onto your bowl. For the base, I ordered Signature Sushi Rice. For the flavor, I ordered Spicy Mayo Salmon and Spicy Garlic Sesame Tuna (additional cost). For the toppings, Pineapple, Edamame, Nori Flakes, Lime Avocado and Spiced Roasted cashews (some of them are with additional costs).Decided to sit on one of the high tables. On the side, there was a serving table with \"dressings\" that you could add onto the poke bowl. The colors of my bowl looked vibrant and it definitely made me to dig in straightaway.The combination was perfect. I love each and every ingredients I chose. Each of them have distinct tastes which combined the dish well - crunchy, sweet, sour, spicy.. The must tries are the roasted cashews, tuna and salmon. This place's interior design made the surroundings to be homey. Service was fast but a little pricey. But overall, I enjoyed my meal and will be back again in the near future.","1405":"Very nice and clean space. Looks very good as well. The poke served here are prepared with a lot of passion and love. It's simply amazing. The passionate staff would put your through the paces in selecting your perfect bowl. Whether it's rice, quinoa or a salad. It's ambience is all you want in a place like this. When you're there, don't be shy! Talk to the staff and let them know how you love their food.","1406":"Had a large bowl of sushi rice with Original Shoyu Tuna and spicy Mayo salmon. Added pomegranate, avocado, kale chips, edamameThe fish and rice were tasty and liked how they infused lime into the avocado. However thought the rice was too little in comparison to the amount of toppings you have. Liked how you could mix and match and the serving system was efficient to make even the line during the lunch crowd move pretty quickly. Thought that it was slightly too expensive though, I could go to a Japanese restaurant and pay the same or less for tastier dons","1407":"Something about this place throws me off. Maybe it's the lighting. Or it could be they add too much stuff to the poke bowls. It a bit of both. Poke is meant to be extremely simple. That's how the Hawaiians do it. Fish. Soy. Onions. Garlic. And maybe one or two items of flair. I think the \"poke wars\" of 2016 have made diversifying a priority for competitive differentiation between poke shops. Too bad poke is a commodity and should stay that way. Complexity dilutes taste. But if you don't care about taste and would rather queue up to spend money on a glorified bouquet. Go ahead. Purists like me will make poke at home. DM me if you want my poke recipe.","1408":"I REALLY wanted to like this place, poke bowls are my new jam, as they are filling, decently priced and semi healthy. \u00c2\u00a0I needed to try something new from Poke Bowl, and decided to check this place out. \u00c2\u00a0So, as far as what you get for your money is awesome! 100g of salmon\/tuna for about $11 is killer. \u00c2\u00a0I opted for the spicy mayo tuna I believe with lemon quinoa and edamame, as well as carrots, and Japanese cucumbers. \u00c2\u00a0The ingredients are fresh, and the amount you get is quite well. \u00c2\u00a0However, the flavor is bland, bland, bland. \u00c2\u00a0When I order spicy miso, I expect some kick. \u00c2\u00a0The spicy miso salmon at Poke Bowl makes my eyes water. \u00c2\u00a0No salt, so spice, no nada. \u00c2\u00a0Super disappointing.","1409":"Efficient service and a beautiful space. I like how customisable the poke bowls are, though the pricing system for the different additions on the menu board could be clearer. The avocado mayo salmon was fantastic. If you don't like raw fish, the smoothie bowls are worth the trip in themselves--the maca nutter was earthy and delicious, though I can't vouch for the absence of any added sugar.","1410":"The stall uncle happens to be one of disciples of the 4 heavenly kings of Singapore Cantonese cuisine. That itself should speak about the quality of food here. An added bonus? One of the pioneers of roast - fatty ox; located just next door :)If you're here for ambience and service, don't expect any. But if you're here for some delicious, restaurant standard cze char served in little claypots, you've come to the right place. Recommendations include the sweet and sour pork ( made with real hawthorn!), kong pao chicken (order this or you'll regret), seafood tofu, pork ribs, crab meat shark fin soup (it uses fish maw despite its name). Absolute perfection for a cze char stall. Only downside is it's in a hawker centre and you'll sweat eating hot claypot food. SmallPrice to pay anyways.","1411":"Very tasty bak kut teh. Service is quick and competent.","1412":"The best pork ribs soup in Singapore. I even bought their soup seasoning packages back to California for my family and they loved it.","1413":"moved to a nicer venue and also offering other dishes. \u00c2\u00a0the white peppery broth bak kut teh is complex and sophisticated here. \u00c2\u00a0very nice flavor and ribs. \u00c2\u00a0also had good chiuchow fish.","1414":"Tasty Hyderabadi dum biryani rice with a harmony of spices. Every single mouthful had a flavor & texture with distinct taste of spices that comes together well. The Bismati rice was light & fluffy. Their chicken was a bit on the dryer side having been prepared dum Biryani style but the winner was their flavorful rice. Thanks Stella for the treat.","1415":"Located right in the lobby of Pan Pacific Orchard, 10 at Claymore is a hidden treasure for buffet fanatics. First things first, 10 at Claymore's buffet differs from other buffet because they have a special buffet menu on top of your typical buffet spread. Meaning, the buffet menu is seasonal. Maybe from the month of January to March, they will have an Australian Steak special buffet menu, or it could even be a seafood menu. It depends on what is available during that season really. And from that menu, you can order anything cooked fresh from the kitchen served to your table as many times as you like. That is the selling point of this place. Their normal buffet spread is not too shabby as well. I love their seabass, roast potatoes, bread pudding and roast meat. And personally, the quality of the buffet spread is actually quite good which makes the price (which is in the $50-60 range depending on what is on the seasonal buffet menu) quite worth it. I came back here to eat at least \u00c2\u00a04 times already and always walked away feeling full and satisfied with the service and quality of the buffet. It is a great place for a date or for a big group of people. Do give it a try!","1416":"The highlight of this place is the oyster station where they serve oysters of different countries. It has the longest queue during the start of dinner service. The oysters are really fresh and juicy. My favorite would be definitely from US. One is enough to fill my entire mouth of creamy ocean freshness. Yums:pOther than oysters, their chilled prawns are pretty good too. Those bright red-orange crustaceans are very fresh and springy to bite.One station I would recommend to skip is the Penang laksa and prawn mee. Laksa gravy is not thick and tangy enough. Prawn stock is bland and tasted tad off? Not sure if it's due to my mixed palate. These two dishes are my least favorite. The variety is not as wide as the other buffets I have been to but definitely of better quality. Both cooked food (roasted pork belly, satay, soup etc) and seafood. In short, I'm pretty impressed by their food quality. There's an ongoing $98++ for two pax CNY promotion. Pretty good deal if you like oysters and other seafood.","1417":"We came back for dinner on a Saturday. Unlike lunch, dinner is sold out at 10 at Claymore. Because we made a last minute reservation online, they accommodated us with seats in the lounge area, which was actually nicer and quieter despite being further from the food.They are currently having their Oysters and Lobsters special, which runs for only $68++, which is cheaper than lunch at some other places (and you can use credit card or chope for a discount), and they refill the oyster and lobsters so there is no running out. Besides cold steamed lobsters, they also served a chili crab sauce version, which was delicious, and a grilled version with butter and garlic. The night we were there, they were serving oysters from USA, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. The oysters are chucked to order. It was interesting to try the oysters from different places.Besides the oysters and lobsters, they were serving beef on the roast station, and there was a tray of braised lamb which was delicious. They also had BBQ sauce pork ribs, which was very popular (and flavorful!). I skipped the local delights. There was unlimited fried mantous with the chili lobster, which I filled up on. I also liked their cranberry bread. Yes, we shouldn't load up on carbs at a buffet, but some things are just tasty.I wanted to recognize the excellent service by their staff -- despite being seated out of the way, our plates were cleared regularly. The wait staff at the tea station knew where I was seated so they offered to deliver my drink instead of having me walk across the lobby with the drink. An all round good experience. I'll probably be back for lunch though, because it was quieter.","1418":"We came here for Saturday lunch. They do not serve oysters at lunch, only at dinner. Also they serve chilled lobster claws at lunch, but the entire chilled lobster is available at dinner. This is a smaller restaurant compared to the larger Pan Pacific's Edge, so the variety of food is more limited, but I think the quality of the food is higher. We enjoyed the sashimi (I think it tasted better than at the Edge, where we were last week) -- there are 3 types of fish: salmon, swordfish and tuna. I enjoyed the roast lamb, and the lamb mousakka. The oxtail stew was excellent as well. They had a small but good selection of desserts. I forgot to check out the ice cream, but they only had space for 2 flavors. I had a crepe, and it was delicious. It's a crispy kind of crepe, and they offered local fillings like durian and kaya. I would have had seconds, but we ran out of time. I didn't try the chocolate fondue. I enjoyed the cream puffs.Because it's a smaller place, and there aren't so many customers, they don't refill their entrees. We arrived at 12:30pm, 30 min after the start of the buffet, and already the oxtail stew was almost gone. I went back a couple of times to check, but nope, no refills. In most cases, there was plenty of food to satisfy everyone. The staff was also very nice. We got to talking (and there was a giant downpour outside), and ended up leaving way past the 3pm closing. They let us sit around and cleaned around us. I would go again. Hopefully, there is something else besides the Penang prawn noodles, coz it's not my kind of food. Would have preferred a pasta station.The price of lunch is $48\/person, but we had a 20% discount through our UOB credit card.","1419":"Recently, my boyfriend and I went to 10 @ Claymore for the dinner buffet. Being a huge foodie and a poor student at the same time, he hardly gets to enjoy quality food in huge quantities - but that night was like a dream come true!Most people cite the seafood section as the main attraction, and I can see why. The lobsters and prawns were cold and sweet, oozing freshness. I don't eat oysters but the boyfriend loved them so much he went for seconds. And you know it's really good if you go for seconds of the same food item at a buffet. The sushi corner was acceptable, with the usual range of maki and sashimi.Another section you ABSOLUTELY CANNOT MISS is the premium beef counter; each person is only allowed 2 servings (additional orders are at about $58...Which is the price of the buffet itself) but it's sooo worth it! The meat literally melts in your mouth. But before trying the premium beef you should order the lamb and \"regular\" beef from the menu given. The menu has 4 dishes which are part of the buffet but you need to order from the waiter who will also serve it to you. Don't know if they change the menu but that night it was char kuay teow, hokkien mee, aussie style beef steak and new zealand lamb steak. ALL SO GOOD. Especially the CKT. Don't worry the portions are small so you can just order them all and ask for seconds if you want. Ok, dessert can be summarized in one word: CREPES. Freshly made, piping hot and generous fillings - nutella and durian, both good - I would have had 2 of each if I hadn't been so full. The chocolate fondue fountain would definitely be a hit with the kids (it brought out the child in me). They have really good ice cream too (take my bf's word for it because i was about to keel over from overeating), the lemongrass flavour is especially nice.To top it all off, they have a coffee and tea counter too. With a barista and a proper machine to make coffee for you. And expensive tea (you know the kind where the bags are hand sewn and pyramid-shaped like five stones). Oh and the service staff are really nice! One waiter ran after me when i forgot my dabao-ed birthday cupcake. All in all, a great experience. If you don't count the buffet aftermath at home.","1420":"Excellent buffet. \u00c2\u00a0Fresh tuna\/salmon sashimi, crab, mussels, lamb, pad thai, etc. \u00c2\u00a0The only thing it didn't have was beef\/steak or oysters...but fantastic nonetheless.","1421":"I have always like 10 at Claymore lunch buffet as being quite value for the dollar, especially when there is credit card \"1 dine free\" promotion, making it either a 25% or 33% discount. I like the clean contemporary design of the place, and being a bit away from the main Orchard road thoroughfare, it is often quiet too. The selection is not huge like other hotel buffets but they are of good quality. Quality over quantity. It has been a couple of years since I last dined there but I always remembered the roast beef as being very nicely done, despite them being placed in the chafing dish. I went last week and was disappointed to know the roast beef was no longer on the menu and the place has been slightly revamped (for the better). There was more Asian dishes this time round.The highlight was the special menu featuring 3 Penang\/Malaysian dishes - char kway teow, assam laksa and prawn noodles. Of these, the char kway teow was to die for. The wok hei smell, tender noodles and rich flavor and slight spiciness just teased the senses tremendously. The 2 noodle soups could be better. The prawn noodle broth lacked the strong robustness of a really prawny rich base. The assam laksa soup also had no punch to it. It could do with a stronger assam or hei ko taste to it. There is a pasta station and a grill station now. The grill meat was bbq baby back pork rib and grilled pineapple. That was good. The meat was pretty soft and slid easily off the bone. There was no cold seafood or sashimi but I did not mind. I like the selection of the cold cuts and smoked salmon and rolls\/breads with various oils and herb butter. The hot food was decent. I liked the beef stew and sour-tumeric fish (a bit indian style). The Chinese style fish was fresh with firm meat, likewise for the vegetables which were not overcooked and retained a bit of crunch to it. The only negative is the dessert. It is still not as good as other places. It was that way few years back and it is still the same. The bread and butter pudding was interesting as either they used all the danishes in it or just topped it with danishes and croissants. I do not mind going there again, if only for the Penang char kway teow.","1422":"I was very impressed with the variety at lunch which allowed an out of Towner to try a variety of new things. The staff was so very helpful and allowed me to ask questions as I wanted to understand the origin and Ingredients in all this amazing new food. A great quiet spot with a plentiful Buffett and menu.","1423":"For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog!This time, i had the brunch buffet at 10 at Claymore, a modern bistro grill offering a sumptuous collection of contemporary European cuisine, accentuated with some Pacific Seafood touches. Fresh scallops, prawns, Alaskan King Crabs, lobsters and sashimi are available. And i loved the creamy and more substantial Canadian Fanny Bay oysters. Can't say no to the Iberico ham that was the centerpiece display (till i devoured it whole). The cheeses that i love are available as well, and i spotted smoked cheddar and blue cheese too. The Whole Roast Wagyu Bolar Blade has a fine marbling of between 9 to 10 and it was quite juicy despite its dry appearance. \u00c2\u00a0There's quite a variety of Chinese dishes in fact and all are well executed. The Steamed Lotus Rice was fragrant though i wish for it to be more moist. Oh and that Kurobuta Pork should not be missed as well. Organic Plates of Pleasure are available in Apr and May. You would be happy to know that you get unlimited servings of these petite plates and every dish was stellar. \u00c2\u00a0The Organic Pressed Home-Made Dou Fu was silky on the inside and the golden exterior was really aromatic. The green stuff is actually organic spinach which is compressed together with the toufu. Love the light tasting broth which is slightly sweeted by the Pacific Blue Crab.While the Norwegian Wild Salmon in Imperial Bonito-Miso Broth may not have a strong miso taste (i'm comparing it to Nobu's famed Miso Cod), i appreciated the light touch in flavoring, leaving the fish to speak for itself. The perfectly cooked meat gave way to a moist pink centre which was just of the right texture.Our favorite dish was the New Zealand Grass-Fed Beef Tenderloin no doubt. The fork tender medallion had such an amazing texture that i hardly needed to chew on it. Chef Chris explained that the meat is roasted under low temperature (similar to sous vide but in an oven) to break down all the veins typical of grass fed beef. They do it for the lamb rack too. The creamy and starchy Mashed Organic Potato with Truffle was irresistible and Nutty Marmalade Cr\u00c3\u00a8me was a great complement to the meat.The sweet section was quite extensive as well with many cakes, puddings and more. We had the interesting Lemongrass ice cream from New Zealand that day. I quite enjoyed the bread pudding, as well as the petite mango pudding.Do not give the crepes a miss. We asked for the extra crispy one with Mao Shan Wang Durian topping and it was out of this world. The puree is the real deal and it's a convenient way of eating durian really. Damn i'm missing this already.","1424":"I was there for my future (Fiance's) niece's birthday celebration. Let me say that I am impressed with the special free flow ala-carte items that you can order on top of the usual buffet spread. The lamb shank was succulent and medium rare steak was really medium rare. Love it! Otherwise, if you are a fan of seafood, you will be happy there too, with the fresh, juicy oysters and decent enough lobsters. There was also so many different types of desserts to go with the meal, my favorite was the crepe- you can put fresh (LOADS AND LOADS of) durian on it. Yums! Oh, the service was awesome too, they gave the birthday girl (and us) a huge cake on the restaurant. Good place to go for family gatherings!","1425":"If you love oysters, then 10 at Claymore is one place you should definitely visit. Besides the variety of oysters, the Boston lobster claws was one of the other item on the menu that had me going there! I love their Penang style prawn noodle that comes with a thick strong prawn stock and the fried kuay teow where you can actually taste the wok hei. But if I had to choose one dish, to be the main highlight, it would have to be their signature Plate of Treasures which showcases 6 of the restaurants best dishes depending on seasonal produce.","1426":"We ate here in early December and I'm just getting around to writing this review. I am pretty picky and have eaten all around the world. We made a reservation and were seated right away. Everyone was friendly but one particular gentlemen was super nice and made the meal start off well. We tried everything on the plates of pleasure menu and nothing really stood out for me. \u00c2\u00a0My husband liked the char su noodles and I thought the lamb was the best of the menu. Now to the real good stuff! The seafood was fresh and nicely presented. My favorite was the oysters with horseradish sauce and the fresh cut salmon at the sushi station, just melted in your mouth. My husband loved the tenderloin station and returned many times. Even though tenderloin is not the best cut, they somehow made it melt in your mouth also. \u00c2\u00a0The buffet is small, one of the smallest I've seen but the quality of seafood and meat was excellent. The great service topped off the night giving this place 5 stars from us. I think the meal for 2 adults and our son came out to about $200 which included wine, nice. We've already made reservations for New Year's Day.","1427":"I've sampled Italian and pseudo-Italian food nearly everywhere I've ever been to (Italy included), and maybe the only thing I've actually learned is that Italian cuisine is based on simplicity. It is not about technical skill, but about great flavours, fabulous ingredients and careful combinations. Or so I think.Ciao@ in Kampong Glam is a fine Italian restaurant. It has two entrances, one on Haji Lane and another on Arab Street. It has a nice ambience and a massive selection of Italian wines. We arrived there on a very hot afternoon and felt immediately welcome. The menu is rather simple, but it's still hard to choose a main dish since all seem fabulous. Once the food came it turned out to be even better than we imagined. Fresh ingredients with great flavours, all masterfully combined to achieve true Italian delight.The menu has a warning, asking customers for patience since \"it takes time to cook with love\" (or something along that line). Ciao delivers on that promise. The care they put on their food is truly worth the wait.","1428":"Looking for \"real\" Italian pizza in Singapore? This is the place. Near Arab Street. (July 2018)","1429":"Ciao was better than I expected of an Italian place in the middle of Singapore's Arab neighborhood. We had one pizza and two pastas, all large and filling portions. Prices were very reasonable especially for Singapore considering the amount of food you get. We enjoyed all three dishes and the authentic flavors provided a much needed break from the pan-Asian options that take over most of the city. The restaurant was cute, comfortable, with friendly and quick service! Would come back again.","1430":"Very casual Italian restaurant. Just walk in, tables are ready. Food is just decent, not mind blowing. Good for a Mon-Wed dinner, but I wouldn't make it a date night joint. Pizza met expectations with crispy crust and sizable portions. Pasta selection is a bit thin and the bolognese sauce was runny. If you're in the area, this is your once shot for Italian. Don't make a long trip out of your way for it though.","1431":"I never bother to write restaurant reviews but this place was so bad I felt that as a service to others I had to. The food is nearly inedible. After we sent back 3 of the 4 dishes we ordered because they were soo bad, (I'm talking cold Spaghetti O's from a can bad), the owner came over to yell at us because we didn't like the food. None of us quite knew what to do except I guess apologize to him for the fact that his food was terrible. The restaurant is located in a very popular tourist street, with lots of late night bars, so really we weren't expecting fine cuisine, but it was bad. The chicken tasted spoiled in the pasta dish we ordered, the 'bolognese' was so salty, it couldn't be eaten, and the sauce had that tinny taste like it came from a can. Also, the place is quite expensive for serving such terrible food. We finally gave up and left. Paid over 100 SGD for food we didn't eat and had to apologize to the owner for the privilege of doing so. Stay Away !!P.S. The people at the table next to us, ordered pizza rather than the pasta dishes we ordered, and they said it was O.K.","1432":"good beer and wine selection and reasonable prices for (Singapore anyway). Good service and genuine Italian pizza and pasta. we love to sit outside and people watch. \u00c2\u00a0interesting crowd can usually be seen on Haji Lane. Usually some love music on weekends also.","1433":"The place was packed on a Thursday night about an hour before closing. Idealite is located not too far from a MRT station. I had a herbal soup with the fixings, which paired really well with brown rice. This herbal soup is not bitter, but actually fragrant with lots of veggies and hard-boiled eggs. The soup can be easily shared with 3-4 people. I also had noodles in a pumpkin curry sauce topped with tofu. The noodles weren't heavy nor did I feel sluggish afterwards.Lots of beverage options at Idealite, hot and cold. I opted for a hot ginger citron tea even though it was hot and humid outside. The inside was nice and cool. Thank you for turning on the AC.Service was good. All the staff members spoke Singlish (Singapore English) and Chinese Mandarin. Restroom is a bit of a tight squeeze, literally, there was one small room. Sink is outside. I'd actually come back again just for the herbal soup!","1434":"Newly opened just 2 months ago, this place is perfect for a chill Friday night out. Good buzz, attentive & amiable servers. They highly recommended their pizzas, but we decided to go for the widely photographed\/publicized Boston Lobster tagliatelle for sharing. It was as good as expected, fresh juicy lobster, paired with homemade pasta - left us stuffed. The calamari appetizer was excellent with the aioli, but slightly pricey for the serving. Seafood was very fresh though. Tried the ricotta castagnole too - would highly recommend, but do share with a bigger group. It does get a bit too heavy for just 2 people. However the little fried dough balls were glorious dipped in the alcoholic custard, complete with a burst of salty sweet ricotta in the middle. Bill came up to ~$140 for 2 for the above 3 dishes, without drinks. Will return to try their other dishes!","1435":"Good Italian spot on HK Street. This place = my definition of a solid 4\/5 stars restaurant. Good food, good service, good wine selection though nothing wow. The highlight here is the pizza - very good dough with generous toppings. Other items - grills, etc. are standard - good quality ingredients with solid execution but nothing particularly notable.","1436":"This was a lovely, chill place for Friday evening with an excellent ambiance. I arrived right around 10pm to catch the kitchen open for another 15 minutes or so. I got the Friday night cocktail special. The bartenders served some yummy spicy olives to start. I was told by the great bartenders to get the pizza. I was not disappointed! I got the pizza (I don't remember the name bc I was blinded by hunger) with the delicious prosciutto and finely minced basil and olive oil and ate the whole thing! #piggypower I also got an old fashioned with a new bourbon they'd just got in and it was phenomenal and didn't break the bank. The owner even shared with me all of the new wines he just brought in on the menu and was very informative and passionate about his work. Just go and experience this place. It's warm and relaxing at the bar!","1437":"I was surprised by the good reviews. The pizza was alright, the cod fish was abit fishy and tasted blend. And the heirloom tomato salad was so underwhelming. For the prices they charge, it was very disappointing and not worth the trip. We skipped dessert as the food wasn't good. Maybe we ordered the wrong food but we definitely won't be back again.","1438":"All round pretty good Aussie food. Pleasant setting although road noise is a little loud. \u00c2\u00a0$6 for a flat white is steep considering the small small cup. \u00c2\u00a0Great area for kids to run and play. Recommend for brunch.","1439":"Had come here with a big group for desserts. Got the chocolate lava cake, creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e and bunch of coffees. Was average in terms of the desserts. Have tasted better. Good place to hang out with a group of friends. one of the few places in Singapore where you can actually sit outside without too much discomfort.","1440":"Really good place for families with kids due to the large play area. Been coming here pretty regularly.Unfortunately, service and food quality has deteriorated in the last year or so - think they're somewhat understaffed now. I'd recommend their pizzas, bruschetta and portobello mushrooms.","1441":"Cafe Melba is housed in Goodman Arts Centre which would be a challenge for those getting there via public transport. Lucky for us, we drove to get there and parking wasn't a problem.A good number of patrons were mostly families with children and the open field in front of the cafe allowed these toddlers to run around freely and play. We happen to visit the cafe on a Sunday so we had the brunch menu selection. For starters, we ordered the Curried Pumpkin and Corn Soup. As for our main course, my boyfriend who is a fan of steaks, decided to order the Ribeye Steak (200grams) while I went for the Melba Burger. To avoid having our food all at once, we requested for the soup to be served prior to our main course. However, everything was served at once much to our dismay. The soup came with four slices of parmesan naan which was a good attempt at matching the curried soup although, did not compliment it. A simple soft roll would have done the job. On another note, thumbs up to the taste and flavor of the soup. It also looked fantastic and the aroma drew us in even more. The Ribeye Steak that my boyfriend ordered was unfortunately a letdown. He had a choice between the Black Pepper or B\u00c3\u00a9arnaise sauce which he chose the latter. It tasted good, but did not go well with the Steak. Moreover, his steak was mildly seasoned and unevenly cooked (he ordered medium rare). The shoe string fries on the side tasted better than the star of the dish. It was golden brown, crispy, and flavorful. The steak also came with salad in balsamic vinegar dressing that was light and refreshing.My Melba Burger looked great. Pieces of bacon were stuffed between the buns along with a perfectly cooked medium rare beef patty and home-made relish sauce. It tasted good, but lack the depth in flavor that would have made me crave for more.Service wise, the staff did not pay much attention to us probably due to the influx of customers. We felt that the service was more of a routine to clear out tables for incoming customers rather than to create that service moment that could have left us with a good impression.Overall service aspect made our experience with cafe melba a mediocre one although the food was not bad. It was however not worth the price we paid and we expected a lot more from them. A few minor tweaks especially in the service aspect would have guaranteed my return.","1442":"Is there a more pretentious place in Singapore? Expats and well dressed locals lunching alfresco in 34 degree heat. Food is \u00c2\u00a0bland and expensive. Last time here for me surely","1443":"Location & vibe-wise, was my type of cafe - quiet neighbourhood, ample parking, large outdoor patio, breezy, and not crowded. Food-wise was average... not bad but not spectacular.Came here on a weekend morning and had the Full Melba Cooked Breakfast for $25: \u00c2\u00a02 eggs, pork sausages, bacon, roasted cherry tomatoes, baked beans, mushrooms, hash brown & toast. I was pretty hungry and considered getting the Mega Melba Cooked Breakfast, an upsized version of the Full Melba, which was $36. The Mega Melba doubles the portions of everything but the eggs, and what I really wanted was more eggs, so I stuck with the Full Melba.It says on the menu that you're not allowed to share the Mega Melba, or in their words \"can't be splitted\". That's not very nice... I wonder if they would have a problem with their customers sharing any of the other dishes? Is the Mega Melba too good a deal? If anything it would make their pricing a little more decent as $25 veers on the side pricey for breakfast. They did however provide a glass bottle of water and cups without us having to ask which I thought was nice considering how many cafes these days won't even serve you tap water.Overall, I can see myself coming back if I'm in the area. I don't mind paying a little extra to avoid the crowds.","1444":"Porcini Mushroom Ravioli ($18 before GST) - 2.5 starsArrabbiata sauce, mushroom fricassee, cheese, and crushed hazelnutsI was really disappointed with this dish because it sounded, and looked, so promising. Unfortunately, it tasted very much like American-Italian - in this case I suppose it'd be Australian-Italian although I haven't had Italian food in Australia. It'd probably be the equivalent of having pasta at Buca Di Beppo in California. I liked that the flavours were strong, but what I enjoyed about the dish ended there. It wasn't refined at all - it tasted heavy and cloying, and not in a good way the way comfort food can be. The ravioli skins were far too thick - imagine fat floury soggy dumpling wrappers - and were stuffed with cheese that was the wrong texture. The hazelnuts also ended up adding to the density of the dish as well, when I could've used some herbs or greens to lighten and freshen the dish.I'm giving it three stars overall because I'd try some of the other (probably non-pasta) dishes if I do go back. Ambience overall was cute, though I can see why another reviewer said it leaned toward ramshackle rather than rustic.","1445":"Standard has dropped a lot over the years. Ordered the pancakes during a not so busy time of 4pm and they were pretty obviously microwaved and not freshly made. How do I know? Arrived almost instantly, with steam blazing hot coming out of the pancakes and a horrible texture that can only be achieved with microwaved-old-food. Tasted pretty horrible and the garnish of half a sliced banana was just sad. Was served with what tasted like cheap syrup rather than a maple sauce or anything remotely nice. Had the rosti as well. Did not add salt at all and the \"poached\" eggs were kinda hard boiled. Nothing was seasoned properly. Kinda disappointing because this was in my memory a great place to eat at. Prices are still high. Ordering system was good and efficient but poorly planned on some tables. The iPad was placed in the middle of 2 diners eating which to me was pretty poor thinking. The floor around me was wet and had food all around telling me that the servers were pretty oblivious to things going on around the restaurant. Pretty sure this does not happen that often here but this particular experience was exceptionally poor. For their prices & the amount of people that were there while I was there at 4pm, they really should have some sort of consistency towards their cooking with a full team of chefs in the kitchen.","1446":"Hands down, my new favorite family brunch place in Singapore. We went on a Sunday morning at 10 and almost every table outside was a family (we were 4 adults and 3 kids). It was a great experience - the atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding and the service excellent. Since I think we got there on the early side, there was really no wait to speak of. We were seated promptly, the ordering process by iPad was explained and the kids were free to go to town. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the eggs Benedict, my wife had the eggs florentine and out friends has the full breakfast and another dish - everyone loved the meals! The portions were excellent and the food was served quickly. The kids menu was extensive and the little ones devoured the pancakes and French toast. Prices were very reasonable as well. I don't think I could have enjoyed the experience more. I wanted to take a picture but honestly, the food looked so good, by the time I remembered to, I had already dug in! :)A co-worker goes often in the evening and raves about the pizza and dinner meals - he often goes for a beer and meal after work; I plan to join him again soon as I am anxious to try the non-breakfast items.","1447":"This is a regular Saturday or Sunday brunch location for my family and friends. Specifically because it is so good for kids. A large field for kids to run around in, a sand pit, and their own Bouncy Castle. While it sits next to a busy main road there is a fence keeping the children playing in grass and not traffic. With ample outdoor seating there is always a full patio of parents enjoying some quiet time while the kids run wild. When it is time for the kids to come back and eat they have a reasonable set kids menu that includes drinks and a dessert. Also the menu is a paper placemat with it's own coloring, activities, and colored pencils. I find the food to be good, it isn't the best food in town, but I certainly don't dislike eating here. I have ordered the Chicken Schnitzel burger before and forgotten that it is too much chicken and almost impossible to eat and enjoy. The Burger is good, the wood fired pizza is also good. The price does feel a bit expensive, not outrageous in Singapore but a bit high, worth it for the distracted children though. The service has been good, a variety of wait staff, all who can help you and take your order, things do get a bit slow, but they do get slammed and busy.As I side note, while I have not experienced it, apparently they are more than kids and castles, they have live music and ladies night throughout the week as well. May have to come back here and try it one evening.","1448":"I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to salads. I know what that sounds like, but it's true. Unfortunately, Cafe Melba doesn't cater to salad snobs. I went to their new Mediapolis location on a Saturday. It wasn't crowded at all. The decor was fresh with an Australian vibe so quite pretty. However, I don't like the idea of ordering on iPads. There is always some confusion about whether an order was confirmed or not.We ordered a Greek salad and sweet potato fries.The salad too bad at all, perhaps the dressing was a little on the sweet side and there wasn't enough feta to counteract it. I was just disappointed with the choices -very limited. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries came in a generous helping and were pretty tasty.Overall, it was okay. Nothing special.","1449":"This is a review of a work-related team event at Cafe Melba. \u00c2\u00a0There were approximately 50 people at the dinner\/drinks event.This review will be shorter and less detailed than most of my dining reviews.I asked a small group from the team I manage to organize a end of year holiday party for our team. \u00c2\u00a0They selected Cafe Melba (in the Goodman Arts Centre).Cafe Melba has indoor seating and covered outdoor seating with mounted wall fans. \u00c2\u00a0Our event was held in the al fresco area. \u00c2\u00a0View of indoor seating:tinyurl.com\/cuqvpepThe outdoor seating area is quite nice. \u00c2\u00a0It maintains a feel of almost being indoors. \u00c2\u00a0It easily accommodated our group and could also accommodate a quite larger group. \u00c2\u00a0I do not think weather (unless very severe) would be an issue. \u00c2\u00a0The covering looked as if it could hold up against a relatively steady and strong rain. \u00c2\u00a0The fans were well placed to keep the area cooled.View of outdoor seating:tinyurl.com\/c23enfuWe had a buffet style meal. \u00c2\u00a0Drinks were provided via pre-paid tickets.The food was quite good. \u00c2\u00a0Everyone seemed to really enjoy it. \u00c2\u00a0There were numerous dishes including a chicken, beef, pasta dish, different kinds of pizza, salads, etc.. \u00c2\u00a0Chicken:tinyurl.com\/cwje5slPizza:tinyurl.com\/cc98g64Misc:tinyurl.com\/cuznjjaThe staff was attentive and kept the food and drinks flowing. \u00c2\u00a0The manager was on site throughout the event and in constant contact to insure the evening was going well.Overall - Cafe Melba provided the back-drop for an enjoyable event. \u00c2\u00a0The outdoor space was perfect for our team event. \u00c2\u00a0 The staff was professional, polite and helpful. \u00c2\u00a0The management was engaged in assuring the event went well. \u00c2\u00a0Very importantly, they served a wide range of well-prepared food that was enjoyed by the team. \u00c2\u00a0I would have no issue in planning another team event there. \u00c2\u00a0Once again, I thought they did an all around great job.","1450":"Cafe melba is located in the arts centre in kallang and they have a nice atmosphere and good food. I had the fish and chips which was not bad but nothing spectacular. The service staff was pretty responsive when I asked why my order took 45 minutes to arrive for a fish and chips. And they serve all the food together, including light snacks and starters. Kitchen size is too small to accommodate capacity. You are also unable to make a reservation in advance so come early especially on weekends.Severely overrated","1451":"My favourite dishes? They gotta be1. Beef Rendang2. Rib Eye Sandwich3. Rocket and Parma pizza 4. Crab fish Linguine Oh and the list goes on...!A pretty little bistro tucked in a little corner at the Goodman Arts Centre that used to be the basketball court of the Old Lasalle College of the Arts.Besides the mains, diners can look forward to all day brunch and for those who just want a little snack, check out their Carrot Cake. Filled with raisins and walnuts, it's more than just a normal carrot cake! The size is good for 2 to share at $8\/slice.Their lychee martini according to a fren who can't resist a glass of good martini thinks its pretty good too. Ok, now I'm really hungry!!","1452":"I've been eagerly anticipating cafe melba's opening, and I was not disappointed. The coffee here is the best in the east side of town and is pretty near my place. Happiness!I prefer ordering a piccolo as its stronger and more aromatic. The glasses for the latte are a little big, so the coffee gets quite weak and diluted. I've got to say, the service here is pretty good! The waitresses seemed a little hesitant and inexperienced, but yet were friendly and polite.Also, when I asked about the latte tasting weak, the barista came over and recommended the piccolo. After that I noticed they only charged me for my first order. When I brought this up, they said the piccolo was on the house as I was unsatisfied with the latte. :)The food here is of good quality! Ive tried the breakfast menu and was very satisfied with the eggs Benedict and big breakfast. Prices are a little steep but take advantage of the promotions on at the moment!Weekday mains charged at 25% off, while on weekends, you get a free coffee when you order a brunch main before 4pm! Not sure when the promo ends but i was just there last week and it was still on!The rib eye sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich were both lovely, nestled inside very yummy bread. However the buns for the Melba burger were a bit too doughy for me, though the ingredients inside we're fresh and the beef patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare juicy delight.Great ambience and it's great for families as there's a large field out front, and I've seen an inflatable bouncy castle on weekends!","1453":"I love of how spacious the place is . It's one of places that ppl in East can go for relaxing brunch and lunch , but beware there are lotsa kids in here . I had burger w extra pineapple and beetroot and I had kiwi passion fruit smoothies for my drinks. Both r great and worthed for the price. We were waiting for about fifteen mins when we went there on Sunday around 1pm","1454":"This Australian bistro is a little gem hidden away in the Goodman Arts Centre (GAC) - it opens up to a green field, and combined with the high ceilings, glass panels and wooden decor give it a warm and inviting feeling where you feel you can sit and chill out the entire afternoon.The menu is quite extensive - there's all-day breakfasts, along with your requisite starters, main courses, pizzas, sarnies (that's sandwiches for the non-aussies). My table had the Eggs Benedict with bacon or salmon (both yum), the portobello mushroom stack with a pasta side (also good), and a 12-inch personal pizza baked in their on-site wood fire kiln! My favourite bit would be desserts, which are not on the menu but displayed on the counter for you to pick. That day we had a lovely decadent chocolate cake that came with additional berries and cream... super rich and awesome! For the thirsty, the caffeine addicts in my group pronounced the Cafe Melba cuppa good, and there's quite a long list of alcoholic drinks for you to sip and wind down to at the end of the day. All in all this bistro is a welcome addition to GAC, and makes a great option when one is a little too lazy or the weather is too insane to head out to the hawker centres nearby.P\/S: Cafe Melba has a special Neighbours card with discounts and perks for its fellow tenants at GAC... check with the staff to find out more!","1455":"I wanted to like the place because it does look promisingly chill. BUT the rude service put me off completely. For one, you do not ask your customers condescendingly what they are taking pictures for. I believe the actual words were 'What is that for?' While i do not expect special privileges as a food reviewer, basic friendliness should apply to any customer. Plus, the prices are pretty high and this is coming from someone who is willing to pay for brunch. Would i pay this price for food at a restaurant with mediocre ambience and terrible service? Hell no. You shouldn't either.","1456":"Great location for kids. Shame the service is non-existent with one staff working on a weekend morning. Food average and cold. New management needed and may turn it around","1457":"Food was good, but not great. Curried pumpkin soup was lovely -- great texture, lots of flavour. The naan bread it came with was okay, but didn't feel like \"proper\" naan. Truffle fries were delish -- we devoured them once they finally arrived... ... which leads me to why the 3 stars. Service is TERRIBLE. Terrible! Our server couldn't remember our orders. When they arrived, they came at widely different times. One got left off completely, and we had to wait another 20 minutes for it. It was a gong show. Great wine list. We had lots of that. :)The atmosphere is lovely -- being able to sit outside with fans, in front of a green space, and listen to music wafting in from nearby studios -- all really comfortable and relaxed.I just wish the service wasn't so relaxed. It's the one thing that needs a kick in the pants.","1458":"Came for breakfast on a Saturday. \u00c2\u00a0Mostly families enjoying the bouncy castle nearby and sitting outdoors. I had granola with yogurt and berries. The food was fresh. \u00c2\u00a0My boyfriend had the omlette which was delicious! We both enjoyed a flat white and long black for coffees. I would go back for their dinner specials which look good. A solid meal.","1459":"Great place for families! I enjoyed the food selection (had eggs florentine that was tasty. Service was exceptional, food and drinks were well prepared, kids enjoyed the bouncer and gravel play box, and the adults enjoyed the time to chat and catch up. We will be back again!","1460":"The restaurant is located in an interesting setting overlooking a humongous lawn inside a Arts Centre and that makes for very nice ambience. Had gone for the RedMart Craft beer festival which was happening in the lawns and popped in the restaurant for some pizza & frozen margaritas both were pretty good, pricing was ok and I found the service to be particularly good! All in all would like to go again","1461":"Dropped by on a quiet Tuesday afternoon and they had 1-for-1 promotion for pizza going on so we took full advantage of that. We got two half&halfs - Chilli Crab and Pepperoni as well as Forest Mushroom and Parma Ham with Rocket. The pizzas are the thin crust variety which is perfect for when you're feeling peckish and not wanting to feel too full too quickly. I'd really recommend the Chilli Crab, my Favorite among the lot we chose. Truffle fries were decent, as with the flat whites. Spotted their promotion on margaritas when I was in the Ladies midway through our meal and decided to get a carafe of Strawberry Margarita to ease into the evening. Frozen margarita was a good idea; tangy refreshing and very much welcomed on the palate after too much carbs between two girls. A word of caution for the slow sipper though, frozen beverages doesn't take too kindly to our harsh humid weather so it didn't take too long till we had a quarter of our carafe left with unattractive slush floating on lukewarm pink liquid - and we were seated indoors! Service was attentive and laid back and I wouldn't mind coming around again to try other items off their extensive menu","1462":"I LOVE brunch! And I think I have found my go to brunch place! For starters, the atmosphere is super chill, perfect for a relaxing brunch. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was super yum! The eggs were free range eggs and they were perfectly poached with a runny yolk. The hollandaise was just how I liked it, accenting the eggs but not overwhemingly heavy. Last but not least, I tried the iced long black coffee and I think its one of the best iced coffees I've had in Singapore. Defintely a place to revisit!","1463":"A surprising find.We were here on a Friday evening and it was surprisingly not crazy busy. Love the chill-out ambience. We were a big group and had no problem finding a table.We only had pizza and truffle fries. Pizza were super thin crust and great for sharing. Think skinny pizza. But if you're a fan of neopolitan style like I am, then this is good but not great.Great relaxing place to hang out with friends. They seem to do great brunches. So maybe I will be back to try that next time.","1464":"The brunch here is one of the better ones I've had in Singapore for the longest time. The ambience here is great and you can spot many other like minded individuals and families here having coffee and enjoying the food.It's shaded from the sun, thanks to a large awning and there's ample smoking area. the fans provide just the right amount of breeze should you choose to sit outside, or you can sit in air-conditioned comfort inside and watch the chefs prepare your meal, thanks to an open kitchen concept.","1465":"Ambiance 100%This is the immediate impression when we stepped in to this charming cafe right in the middle of no where one rainy afternoon after lunch. It is so idyllic and very quiet when we were there. We absolutely adored the decor! It felt like someone's open kitchen, filled with delicious things on the shelves.We only tried their coffees since we already had lunch, but seems like I need to go back again to try the food. I'm already sold on the ambiance, so the food won't be a big problem. Now, how to get there without driving is the challenge...","1466":"okayish australian brunch food hidden away in the goodman arts centre. this place has drawn mixed reviews since opening this year - and I'm about to toss my own undecided judgement into the mix, just so you have as difficult a time as I did of deciding if it's worth visiting.on second thought, perhaps that's not the best strategy for ingratiating myself into your favor. so here's it straight up: this place has great potential, but the food and service are in firm not-travel-worthy-but-I'll-have-it-if-it's-there territory. or more succinctly, meh.I admit to wanting to come here for the longest time, despite those reviews: I had seen photos of the gorgeous space in design blogs, and there's just something incredibly appealing about good lighting for photography.but the place doesn't look nearly this good (one day I will learn to stop trusting photos) in the daytime - and there was this slight ramshackle shabbiness about it, like they hadn't bothered to take care of what should be a well-curated space.the pizzas fared the best that day, hands down. we had the chili crab, mushroom and a trifecta of meat products on the three little pigs. these were well-cooked in a wood-fired oven, with a crust that verged between cracker and thin-crust (nothing nearly as flavorful as the famed mozza - but good in its way), and the ingredients were suitably piled on.the other dishes were less interesting: a burger was stacked high and pretty - and so were the pile of pancakes I ordered, which came in a healthy stack of four and drizzled with compote - and the full melba cooked breakfast was a generous plateful of food. but these suffered from bimboticism, having mastered the art of looking good without much substance.so really, if you're here - head for the pizzas. the other stuff isn't bad, and actually perhaps on par with some hipsterish cafes, but I don't think it's worth traveling for. there is just this pervading sense of unfulfilled potential rather perpetuated also by the sheer nothing-outstanding-ness of both service and food. much better food elsewhere, really.","1467":"$40 for a tasteless Reuben Sandwich & frozen margarita - ouch! \u00c2\u00a0Corned beef should be pinky red - not a dirty grey btw....the sauerkraut should be tart & crisp not soggy and bland. \u00c2\u00a0Very disappointed.","1468":"I am currently in the midst of preparing to record an album at the Goodman arts centre and there aren't too many options for food in the centre. However i did manage to try a bit of food at Cafe Melba. I had what can be described as a type of pizza basket. It's clean slices of flour and dough with some meat, vegetable and cheese toppings on it. These pizzas are extremely thin and you may eat them with a choice of 3 sauces that are given to you - pesto, olive and chick peas sauce. The price range is a bit high. The quality of service is pretty good. And the ambience is the best part of the place. They have a very cool outdoor space seating area with wooden benches and tables. They also have pretty excellent coffee. It's a chillout sunday sort of a place for me.","1469":"Went there for Sunday brunch and the place was a zoo of children. They have a bouncy castle which will occupy the little ones for days. There was a special event for Chinese New Year and it was fun with Lion Dancing and face painting, arts and crafts, balloons, etc. Brunch is simply a breakfast menu and I was not impressed. I couldn't order a sandwich till 11:00 am so I was disappointed. The bacon was steamed and I felt bad the rest of the day. One piece of toast was not enough and I waited 45 minutes for a second $4.00 piece. Dry, cold and everything else had been consumed. The service was horrible. They were busy--I'll give them that--but the drinks were super slow, the food just average and waiting for the toast infuriating. And, they didn't care. The tip was included in the bill and I tipped more so they got more than average for a bad experience. I will say the people at the restaurant were some of the best looking folks on earth. Lots of ex-pats with about a dozen languages floating around. Eggs, toast, bacon, a breakfast sandwich, two juices and it was $75.","1470":"Rather limited menu. Service was patchy. Food quality was very good, but pricy for the portions served. Beers are bottle only and served not very cold. Only real thing it has going for it is the atmosphere. Probably good for just an afternoon tea.","1471":"This place is cute. There is plenty of outdoor seating and on a \"cooler\" singaporean night - its a great place to chill - have a drink and some food. Food selection was alright - since I'm vegetarian my selection was of course limited, but I had pizza and calzones to choose from so it was alright. My friend had the steak and was decently satisfied. We chilled here for quite a while and it was super enjoyable.","1472":"The cozy restaurant is part of Shokutso 10, a corner of Basement 1 in Nex dedicated to japanese cuisine. Typical of Teppanyaki serving standards you place your order, and then your food is prepared in front of you. It's interesting to watch how the chef arranges food on the hot plate according to cooking time, such that it is easy for him to swoop the,off the hot plate and serve. I loved their cheese okonomiyaki.Prices are affordable but, as with most Teppanyaki restaurants, it isn't baby- or toddler- friendly. While it may not be ideal for families or couples with babies. this means you can actually have a conversation over your meal without distractions. I love Japanese food in general and this place made me really happy. So far, it's the best Teppanyaki restaurant I've been to that's away from the bustling (and pricy) CBD.","1473":"Value for money 'fast food'. There are 2 counters where you can watch the Teppanyaki chef in action. Normal table seating are also available. You can go with ala carte or set menu. Beef is good and come with a serving of bean sprouts. The saut\u00c3\u00a9ed mushrooms was also good. I've had better okonomiyaki although the serving is quite generous. Chawan mushi was served in an onion skin which was interesting","1474":"Had been around this area for many times but didn't know why didn't try this place. Now that I've tried, I can say that their food here are totally awesome delicious! The food are very filling too. I've ordered a salmon sashimi salad as appetiser and it is totally delicious! Had ordered bean sprouts, fried rice and more salmon with hotate too. All are awesome delicious! Total bill cost $42+. It may be a little costly but I will definitely go back to eat again. Worth it!","1475":"Amazing place for authentic thai food. Good ambience but price can be slightly on the high side. Service is prompt and quick. Here are some of my favorite dishes that you can try:Chicken WingsPandan Chicken Thai FishcakesPad Thai Green Curry","1476":"Thai food by Marina Bay. Ok food, excellent ambience. Would recommend going for dinner in the evening and sitting outdoor if it's not too hot so you can enjoy the view of SG skyline by the water. Food is standard. We particularly like the pomelo salad but the rest was just ok. Service was very slow though and a bit unfitting of its self-described \"fine Thai cuisine.\" Quite expensive for what we got (~$50\/pax) but again guess you are paying for the atmosphere.","1477":"Easily the best Pad Thai of my life so far. Also had a papaya salad that was very flavorful. Beyond the food, the restaurant is very nice. On the water. Spacious seating. Attentive wait staff. Very pleased.","1478":"Nice and cosy environment. \u00c2\u00a0It is housed in Customs House. \u00c2\u00a0No real scene if you sit inside.Food was average. \u00c2\u00a0Excluding Tom Yum soup which was extraordinary.Service was really attentive and good.","1479":"Yummy pomelo and papaya salad. With great green curry. The place is a bit pricey though","1480":"I used to frequent their first outlet in Ngee Ann City whenever I crave good Thai food. This is my first time to this outlet and due to the location, you can expect a mostly business crowd.Food is generally good but I still prefer Ying Thai Palace for my Thai food cravings, the stuffed chicken wings there is definitely better as it has glass noodles, etc in it, not just minced pork.I like the olive rice in Sabai as they sprinkle chopped bits of lime that gives a great tangy bite. If you are looking for Thai in this part of town, this is probably the best option closely.","1481":"I love this location of Sabai Thai better than the others because of the atmosphere. It is on the water and has a relaxed, upscale vibe. The food is delicious. I personally love their Tom Kha Gai, Panang Curry, and Phad Thai. It is great for business dinners, to go out with friends, or date night.","1482":"Located at the newly renovated level 2 of Marina Square, Supreme Tastes Jiang Nan Cuisine specialises in Jiang Nan cuisine and la mian.We went to check out the new Dining Edition of Marina Square and was attracted to Supreme Tastes because of their $10.80++ lunch sets. The set came with a bowl of La mian and a side of 4 xiao long bao. I had a clear soup wan ton la mian and my friend had the Spicy and Sour la mian. My clear soup was tasty and the spicy and sour gravy was also very flavourful. The xiao long bao was full of soup and the meat was fresh.Overall it was a good meal and it's great value. Not sure if the lunch promotion is going for long but it's definitely worth the buck!","1483":"A nice and decent place for shanghai food. Ordered sour & spicy soup noodle and beef brisket noodle - both are nicely presented and good. The red oil spicy dumpling and delicious too.","1484":"Good food with a lot of variety of noodles, fried rice, meat and fish dishes et al, but \u00c2\u00a0as far as dumplings, steamed buns, wanting & fried rice are concerned would prefer Din Tai Fung. The pricing is reasonable and the service is also good..","1485":"very nice! went around 2-3pm on a weekday and did not wait at all! very poignant truffle flavours","1486":"It's pretty good for a neighbourhood \"Tze Char\" aka stir fry place. Their Assam Fish, Ngoh Hiang, Braised Pork Knuckle, Curry Chicken and fried prawn paste chicken dishes are really yums! They've been around for a long time and are competing with 5 other coffee shops in this area.","1487":"Today's tab was up to standard. Feedback to the boss and got it replaced. She apologized for it. What service!","1488":"Accessible halal coffee shop at the corner of the road. Wide variety of India and Malay food. Prata, Bryani etc Strangely they hire mainland Chinese as waiters, probably have quota issues to get Indian workers.","1489":"So many people I see eating here and yet no reviews. It was close to the hostel and opens very late. I just had the prata roti, plain and garlic and the dipping sauce satisfied the late night craving after a very long flight from the US. Has a quite a bit of variety on the menu.","1490":"I like this place! First of all, it opens at 9am, coffee is super awesome with unique coffee blends. Breakfast toast + coffee or tea set is only $12.90.Lunch sets at $15.90.I would say it's very very reasonable deal.","1491":"Had a large latteInitially I thought the foam was a little bitter, but the coffee is rich and chocolatey. Love it !","1492":"Coffee is good, food is not bad. Good for a quick brunch. I don't think I'll come for a 2nd time.","1493":"This place has a pretty laid back vibe and when I came they had some nice music going which wasn't too loud to talk to someone over. Service was good. My Sandwich was delicious. I requested my ice coffee with ice cream and they were happy to do it despite my request not being on the menu. Pricing is a little higher than most but is what I expected given it is western food.","1494":"There are a few times in life when a meal overwhelms your senses with craftsmanship and complexity. This meal is not it. It is middle of the road fare at unreasonable prices. Very unremarkable food that certainly could be better prepared in the home kitchen. I ordered an $11 banana-blueberry smoothie expecting a taste that justifies the price. Instead, I received a blueberry smoothie without the banana because the kitchen had none in stock. I wasn't even given a choice to decline or change my order, rather it was served to me expecting me to just take it. I did, because I don't like causing a scene, and it was as disappointing as my $13 breakfast sandwich with $5 has brown top up as their dishes don't come with sides. Sad!","1495":"I really enjoyed my lunch here! I went with a friend who's a very healthy eater, and judging by the big lunch crowd, it seems to be a nice respite from all the other not-so-healthy eateries in the area.I tried the Brazilian chicken over couscous and it was everything I wanted. Juicy skewered chicken with lots of flavour but not very spicy, gently placed over couscous that had dollops of pesto and the best goat cheese I've tasted in a while. Factor in the texture, and it went so well together. Top it off with a good olive oil, and daaaaaamn son!It appears they have a decent coffee menu and some bar concoctions, but the food left such a great impression on me that I wouldn't mind re-visiting and trying more on the menu.","1496":"Favorite place for yogis! I heard that they use to give discounts to students studying for their yoga teaching certificate at Tirisula, but sadly that's no longer the case.Best coffee in Arab Street! My favorite order is the Mexican salad with organic chicken and fresh guacamole. Fresh greens, shredded chicken, and zesty guac--me encanta! Other yogis have ordered the Mongolian beef salad and salmon salad. Also quite good! I've also tried their toast, and loved the honey they have! Would def. come back for some food if I'm in the area!","1497":"This place is a total disaster. On the menu it said poached eggs and it came with one cold egg, when we ask for the other egg, the owner showed up and scrutinized us why should we argue over a small mistake on the menu and accused us for starting an argument. All we wanted was what's written on the menu. Food is terrible and service is slow and bad. Please try to avoid this place at all cost.","1498":"Great food and coffee in lovely Arab St \/ Haji Lane are. Aussie style fare, tried a few item and all delicious. \u00c2\u00a0Coffee is top notch!","1499":"So I chanced upon this place after seeing danielfoodiary visit this on instagram. So I got some deal.com.sg vouchers and got 4 other friends to check it out.Here is the store front, it's at the edge of Arab street, I walked about 5 minutes from Bugis MRT Exit D (Downtown line)Once you enter the shop, you will see the bar and front counter, sadly all those sandwiches up on the chalkboard were not available for dinner. I was so looking forward to trying the fully sick sandwich. I guess I have to come back here during lunch time then!So here is their 2 page dinner menu. It is not a lot of items, but it is good, as you don't have to waste too much time picking items. As a group of 5 we decided to pick a bunch of appetizers1. Cracker Squid ($13)The squid was okay, the batter could be crispier, the tartar sauce was okay. The dish looked presentable, but it just didn't taste as good as I had hoped it to be.2. Squid Taco, Pulled Pork Taco, Fish Taco ($8 each)For the pulled pork, that was apparently cooked for 12 hours, it tastes not too bad. Generally pulled pork is very sweet and this wasn't too sweet. I only wish the taco was the crispy corn kind, rather than the flat bread kind. This had me missing my Doritos Tacos for 99 cents in the US!3. Lotus Root Croquettes ($12)I decided to order this as I found this to be interesting, instead of one lotus root, it was all mashed up and shredded up. Pretty much like a mashed sweet potato breaded and fried. I found it a bit strange. The cilantro dip was not too bad, I liked the spices and it added some flavour to the sweetness of the lotus root.4. Truffle Hot Chips ($8)Pretty decent truffle chips, you could definitely smell and taste the truffle oil. My friends even commented that it might be better than Habitat's truffle fries! A pretty good compliment if I might say so myself. They are generous with the fries for just $8 nett. 5 of us each had a good share of it!Main Courses :1. Steak Out ($18)I saw a comment on facebook that their steak was juicy and tender and decided to give it a try. We ordered it Medium and it did come Medium! Hurray! for cooks who know what they are doing! The steak was indeed juicy, tender and not dry! I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would definitely order it again if I was here for dinner.2. Pork Yakitori ($15)For $15, I think this dish is overpriced, unlike the japanese yakitori, this did not taste like it had the yakitori sauce\/teriyaki sauce on it. It reminded me of the halal kebabs, not sure why. The potato salad on the side though, was amazing! It tasted like a egg\/carrot\/potato salad? I am not exactly sure what ingredients went into it, but it was more amazing than the yakitori itself. The yakitori was okay, it was juicy, tender, it was abit hard getting the meat off the stick, but at least the meat wasn't dry.Desserts :1. Brownie ($6)Apparently one of their best sellers, this brownie looked very humble, but once you dig your dessert spoon into it, you realize that it is very dense. Unlike most brownies that you would eat and feel gerlat, \"heaty\", or feel like you're about to get a sore throat the next morning. This brownie gives you that same sensation but not to that extreme. I feel that it would be well paired up with the SegaFreddo, but not at $10 more.2. SegaFreddo ($10) - Brandy Hazelnut GelatoThe cheerful waitress recommended us to try this Brandy infused, hazelnut gelato. There were indeed alot of whole hazelnuts in this Gelato, but I could hardly taste the Brandy. Even though the waiter who served it to us, asked us to eat it with caution, as if we would be completely tipsy from eating the dessert. It was a nice dessert, but definitely not worth $10. We spent a total of $125 for 5 people, with the deal vouchers. It was a worthy dining experience. The shop itself seats at very most 15 pax, I hope they would consider serving the sandwiches during dinner, as I believe it would attract more customers.The service was good and throughout the 2 hours that we were there, the nice Indian lady asked us several times if we needed service, water top up, or any food recommendations as she knew that we were looking for ways to spend the $125.","1500":"Chill vibes and nice servers! Had the salmon wrap which was alright, nothing exceptionally good about it. Also, had the Soy Iced Latte which was actually pretty good. The coffee taste was strong and it paired well with the smooth soy milk. The place is rather small, not the best place for large gatherings. Though it could be a great place for dates.","1501":"The food (eggs with salmon, spicy chicken leg) has been sub-par the three times we've been and the service hasn't been all that great either (waitress seemed lost, they sat us next to a smelly trash can outside). The only thing I'd order again is the waffle and one of the espresso drinks. We had one really interesting experience where I was refused cream with the special hipster v60 (or whatever it's called) coffee. I asked three times, and every time the waitress insisted I order a different coffee no matter how much I pleaded and assured her I wasn't going to put all of the milk in my coffee and ruin it. Give me my damn milk!!!","1502":"Really no reason to go there. First, the service is very bad: server had no idea what the dishes included (do they include cheese, do they come with bread); the dishes were served one, then two, then the last one came after the first three finished eating. Second, the food was meh: potatoes were undercooked, shaksouka came without egg.. very meh. Third: all the brunch dishes included a single egg. Surely one would want more than one egg on toast? Of course we could've ordered more, but this brings me to fourth: the prices are way too high for what you get. I'm surprised this place has 3 stars.","1503":"Went to this place for brunch and was pretty underwhelmed. The coffee was good here but everything else was at or below average. I wasn't feeling hungry so I just got the sourdough toast with butter and honey with a side of bacon. There were 2 small slices of bread, which actually made sense because the toast only cost 3.50. \u00c2\u00a0There was a pack of butter and what appeared to be honey in a small dish. Whatever it was, it was not honey. It tasted more like evaporated milk but whatever, it was still sweet. The bacon was 7 dollars and I got 3 generous strips. Pretty decent for Singapore standards I guess. My toast had some avocado bits and smudges on it which was kind of unsettling. It didn't bother me that there was avocado on the toast, it bothered me that they were messy and careless in the kitchen. My sister got the \"stoner surprise\" (stupid name) which was an eggless waffle topped with strawberries and blueberries. It also came with a side of maple syrup. It looked really photogenic if you get what I mean but it didn't look appetizing at all. She wasn't impressed with the taste. There are so many of these cafes in Singapore now and they're all pretty much the same. The coffee is good but the food is mediocre and overpriced.","1504":"Poor service, dishes differ from menu. They survive by overcharging tourists who will never be return costumers.","1505":"Recently found out that there was a Singtel promotion at this restaurant where one could enjoy 50% off on selected dishes on the menu and dine in here.Iberico Cold Cuts Platter (S$24++)Pork Loin 'Lomo' .

The croquettes were undercooked and the tortilla espa\u00c3\u00b1ola was still eggy and runny on the inside. The drinks are also very very pricy, but at least they were good. I would only go here again if trapped by monsoon rains when staying at the Orchard hotel or if not dining with a vegetarian.","1509":"This was one of my best experiences in Singapore! Close to my hotel great service & happy hour menu. The ambience of being close to the street yet still tucked back a bit to enjoy outside weather and night lights was a great experience. More importantly one waiter in particular Kino was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and it's true roots which to me was phenomenal since it's a Spanish restaurant and he is a Singapore native. This company shares \u00c2\u00a0its entire legacy and experience with the staff so they can share it with the customers. I will be back and I recommend to all visitors. Also loved the comedy shown throughout the establishment!","1510":"Great new tapas place in Orchard by FOC. A little hard to find as it's not accessible via the Claymore Connect mall - it's actually located somewhere to the left of Delfi Orchard.Came here for brunch on a Saturday, food was really good, though a little heavy on the potatoes (my fault, probably). Servings were generous and good value for money. Service was outstanding as well. A little empty at the moment as it just opened and not many people know about it yet. Will be back for sure!","1511":"I had an awesome dinner here on a Saturday night at about 9pm! It wasn't super crowded and this location is much more manageable than the one on Hong Kong St. I had the Kentucky whiskey sour (delicious!) and the pork chop with a pumpkin pur\u00c3\u00a9e (I needed a touch more salt on this). I also had the pine nut and spinach crouquetas (no pic bc I ate them too fast ). I sat at the bar and could watch the kitchen work their magic. This location is huge and would be ideal with a big group of friends.","1512":"I can't speak for the drinks, but the food sucked. \u00c2\u00a0 Bread had the consistency of croutons -- toasted too much and too slowly. \u00c2\u00a0Mushroom croquetas seemed like deep fried condensed cream of mushroom soup and kinda gross. \u00c2\u00a0Also got some weird scrambled egg thing that was deep fried around the edges and came with some unidentifiable deep fried vegetables. \u00c2\u00a0I should have known better than to go to a tapas place. \u00c2\u00a0 Can't get plain wholesome nutrition, instead just some bourgeois bohemian idea of novelty. \u00c2\u00a0Where does a fella have to go to get broccoli, yams, and chicken breast around here?","1513":"This location by FOC is a much much saner space than their main outlet at Hong Kong Street. The food quality is comparable, but portions tend to be on the smaller side (even for tapas). The stuffed churros are amazeballs!!! Highly recommended!","1514":"Absolutely the best Thai food in the neighborhood coffee shops! The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge! More for big diet people. My first time ordering their Basil Chicken rice and I couldn't finish it! The queue is always long during meal times. What I like is that we can call in advance to order the food! Very friendly service.They have a wide range of menu ranging from salads, soups, main course to desserts! \u00c2\u00a0They operate till 8.30pm on weekdays.Absolutely a must return for us!","1515":"I had the privilege of visiting Genesis twice this past week and after being to a lot of vegetarian restaurants in Singapore, this is the BEST. Several things make it stand out compared to others. First, they are in a newer convenient location that allows for ample parking in the nearby carpark. This is a casual cafe that is often busy but they had enough space for our group. The menu is focused on healthy, fresh and tasty Asian-Western fusion, with entrees ranging from vegan lasagna to dumplings and laksa. We always left satiated. I love their vegan cheesecake as its moist and delicious (compared to at other vegetarian places). In my experience, the staff were welcoming and attentive.","1516":"I'm ashamed to say that I've lived within walking distance from Genesis for 2 years before I finally decided to check it out! Now I'm sad I didn't do it earlier! Amazing, affordable and tasty vegan food! Most dishes are around $10-12. Even staunch meat lovers will be impressed!I highly recommend the dumplings, lasagne, chicken rice, thunder tea rice and bibimbap. All are really good and the lasagne, chicken rice and lasagne are super flavourful -- even though there is no meat!Some friends of mine lurrrve the bak ku teh but I'm not a fan. Maybe it's because I'm not particularly big on the really herbal style of soup. But if you are, this might be for you. The tofu cheesecake is excellent. You wouldn't even think it has no dairy in it. Staff is super friendly, chill and attentive. Ask for Agnes, she's my fave!","1517":"Super impressed with this restaurant as I am not a Vegan yet was delighted by the taste and selection offered!From the dumplings to the tofu cheesecake, it was delightful in a lively setting with helpful staff.","1518":"If you're looking for a non-touristy Singapore food experience without having to worry about getting something non-vegan, this is an amazing place to go. It's in the middle of an industrial\/business side of town with residences nearby, but if you're a tourist who wants to see \"real life\" Singapore without the flash and dazzle of Orchard Road, this is a great place to go. The restaurant itself is very clean, although a bit on the warm side, and it's relatively quiet. The menu offers primarily Asian foods, but there are some Western foods as well. On the blackboard, they also list daily specials or meals otherwise not listed on the menu.On the table, they offer silverware and napkins, but the server gave me reusable chopsticks to use. Some of the meals clearly cannot be eaten with chopsticks, so I appreciated the easy access to silverware. I ordered the dumplings, fish head vermicelli, and mint tea. The dumplings came out first, freshly made and served with a spicy orange dipping sauce, which was amazing. The fish head vermicelli came out piping hot, along with very hot mint tea with the leaves still floating in it. This is the second time I've been impressed with the analogue fish here in Singapore, and it was quite tasty with excellent contrast in textures, which is a common complaint I have with most noodle soups. I was very full by the time I finished the meal so I didn't order dessert, but I'll be saving that for next time!Overall, the meal was my favorite that I had in Singapore. It's completely vegan, the staff was friendly and interested in how I found out about the restaurant, and the food was amazing. I only wish I had tried it sooner so I could have had multiple meals there!","1519":"I was so excited to try this place for lunch, and unfortunately it was an enormous let-down. The quality of the service (non-existent) eclipsed the taste of the food. I tried the dumplings & seaweed rolls, which were both decent enough but the interactions with the staff were so negative, I would never go back. The food isn't worth a trip back.","1520":"Muslim Nasi Padang. Basically Muslim mixed rice.I couldn't have stumbled upon this place since it was quite hidden. I had to ask for directions. On the 3rd floor, beside the bridge across People Park and Chinatown Point, next to the UOB ATM.The taste is authentic. The curry chicken somehow looks \"overnight\" but a bite tells otherwise. The sides are very surprisingly mild to the palate, not too spicy, just right. Sweet is the word.For $5.70 it is slightly pricey, but that's what we pay in town.","1521":"As one of Singapore's most well known establishments, Gayatri is at the forefront of many quality spots in Little India. The Rochor area is in a constant state of change but something tells me this place isn't going anywhere.Despite the retro looking exterior, Gayatri is actually much more modern on the inside. The AC is on point and the odors from the food emanating from the back is potent. There is a lot of natural lighting from the windows and the sturdy table top ensure a quality feast from the get go. The menus are electronic and have pictures for every item. If one isn't into the stock photos on the menu (#1), much of the food is on display. This serves as a good inspiration for visually hungry peeps.The food is delicious. The mutton biryani is all that and more, with super flavorful rice and with nice chunks of tender lamb. I also give kudos to their chicken chettinad (kurma) for the deliciously spicy gravy of a curry and the fish head curry is an excellent dish for flavorheads. It's hard to turn down their excellent variety of dosas or their super crispy variations of naan bread.In addition, I love their vegetarian options. The gobi manchurian is popular amongst locals and the paneer butter masala is straight addicting. While most people wouldn't go for something as simple as the aloo jeera, I just appreciate starches for all intense flavors that they offer. Lastly, the mini samosas are delightfully crispy. I could easily snack on them all day.The prices are fair for the city and the service is on point. I understand a big part of their business is catering and I would never hesitate to employ them for a big job since the food is bangin'. If I had to complain about anything, it's how oily everything is. Grease smudges galore.I am already looking forward to coming back again soon. Singapore truly has a gem in Gayatri.___________(#1) Which appear to be Samsung Galaxy Tabs.","1522":"Time : 13:25hrs ishSaturday July 20th 2019My friend wanted something spicy or some form of Biryani hence to this establishment we went for our late lunch. \u00c2\u00a0It was on one of the Weekend, i.e on a Saturday afternoon after work.Once seated, and given the Menu, I wanted to order something else but unfortunately, that particular item is only being cooked after 15:00hrs Singapore time. \u00c2\u00a0*SIGH*Oh well, hence I settled for my 3rd option to have the Biryani instead. \u00c2\u00a0I opt for the Lamb Dum Biryani ($12.50). \u00c2\u00a0My friend opt for the Lunch Biryani set meal ($6.50) which comes with some spicy condiments, Raita and 2 different kind of vegetables on her plate. \u00c2\u00a0My friend also opt for the Fish Curry and some kind of Fried Chicken ($7.00) stuffs as her side dishes. \u00c2\u00a0Her order comes with some form of Papadum. \u00c2\u00a0When I got the chance to taste the Fish Curry it is pretty \"bland\", aka it DO NOT WOW me as much. \u00c2\u00a0Thankfully the Papadum is ok to eat.Thankfully I have my friend aka the company that counts on that Saturday afternoon. \u00c2\u00a0Even my order of Ginger Tea ($3.00) with Milk as part of my beverage is some what lacking and too diluted.Each plate is being layered with Banana Leaf in which I am cool with that. \u00c2\u00a0My order comes with the Biryani, a spoonful of Raita, and a small bowl of Dahl or Curry of some kind. \u00c2\u00a0After a few bites of the Biryani rice, I am utterly disappointed with my order of Biryani. \u00c2\u00a0The Biryani itself aka the rice was a little bland for my tastebud and the meat or protein found in the Biryani itself was some what too little for my liking. \u00c2\u00a0Its more of BONES than anything else. \u00c2\u00a0**DOUBLE SIGH**Oh well, I may return but NOT in a hurry. \u00c2\u00a0NOTE to self, NOT to order the Lamb Dum Biryani again. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps the other items in the Menu which I need to order after 15:00hrs Singapore time will entice me to write a follow up and perhaps from there my review might differ.With all the Indian restaurants available on this street alone, I guess I have to venture more and try more other restaurants available hence my mission of Biryani shall continues.My oh my perhaps it was a Saturday or a weekend, this establishment was somewhat empty before I arrived, while having my meal there and when I left this establishment. \u00c2\u00a0Maybe the other patrons do not want to queue in line from those other famous Indian restaurants along this street. \u00c2\u00a0No line in this establishment, meaning sometimes the food is not that good, hence this 3 Generous Stars review for having a meal here at Gayatri. \u00c2\u00a0At least I have tried having their Dum Biryani here.In terms of service it was ok. \u00c2\u00a0NOT as welcoming as I was hoping for. \u00c2\u00a0Once we are done for our lunch we proceed to the Main Front Counter to make our payments by indicating the table number we were seated at.Gayatri offers Home Delivery and Catering options by calling their hotline number : 6294 6294 or email : catering@gayatrirestaura\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. \u00c2\u00a0Even from the receipt that I had, they indicate for FOOD TO GO or Take Away, it is best to consume those food, within 3 hours of purchasing.Left Gayatri at about 15:00hrs ish.Gayatri Main Restaurant122 Race Course Road,#01-01Singapore 218583Tel : 62911011","1523":"This restaurant's food started out great but fizzled out later. Let me explain.My friend and I ordered two dishes. One small fish head curry and one mutton briyani. \u00c2\u00a0Both dishes appeared very quickly and the fish head curry was served in an earthen bowl on top of a small gas burner. Very nice.The briyani was excellent and the mutton was not too soft not hard. The spices were sufficient and not overpowering nor over spicy. The fish head curry was also very good with nice amounts of meat on the fish head. I guess the size of the order was the size of the head and not the serving bowl.After about 15 mins of eating, the rice of the briyani became cold and hard which might have indicated the rice was not fresh but reheated. The small burner was slowly evaporating the water and made the curry super salty that made it impossible to continue eating. This made ending the meal disappointing.Service was pretty good but there were times we had to flag down a server for service. Another nice thing was the banana leaf used as a plate. It was a bit of a hit and miss.","1524":"My uncle took my brother and I to Gayatri to enjoy some Indian food since we don't get much of it back home. We went in on a Monday night at around 6:30 pm. We shared the Butter Dosa, Butter Chicken, Paneer Butter Masala, Appam and the Murtabak (sp?). My favorite was the Paneer Butter Masala and my brother's favorites were the dosa and appam. The service was good. Our waitress was friendly and helped us when figuring out what to order. I actually enjoyed the food so much that I returned the next night to take my grandma to try it. We ordered similar items to the previous night, but also gave a two vegetable dishes a try. I'm not sure what they were called but I didn't care for them. The service was a bit slower than the night before but the restaurant was much busier.","1525":"Good Indian food in Little India. Lots of options for vegetarians, but you really have to dig for them in the annoying iPad-based menu. Really, can we just go back to normal paper menus please?","1526":"Gayatri was highly recommended by my pal who enjoyed Indian Food and during one of the weekends where we were around Serangoon Area, she suggested to show me her favourite Indian Food eating place since young. Out of curiosity, I followed her. I didn't realized that Gayatri is just located by the side of Muthu's Curry Restaurant and good thing about it is that even though the place is crowded, it is less commercialized.We did not make any reservation and was lucky to grab a seat for two. Service was friendly and accommodating.Instead of having plain rice, we ordered Briyani Rice set that comes with 2 vegetables. Empty plates were given to us with chargeable wet tissue.Servers will then go around topping up rice and sides (cabbages & gourds). You can let them know the portion to be placed on your plate without wasting.What's good about ordering like this is that the vegetables are free flow and you are free to request for refill upon finishing them.We requested for chicken as well as fish curry to pair along with our Briyani Rice.Butter chicken was great in its fragrance. The chicken were char-grilled and cooked with garlic, ginger, onion and cashew nut gravy. \u00c2\u00a0Gravy was luscious and yummy, also a good alternative to pair them with the rice.Butter Chicken - $8.50 (Small)Comes in two sizes, small or large. They were not too spicy and with excellent texture that give full hints of freshness in their Sotong.Sotong Masala - $6.50 (Small)Easing the amount of spice, it will be good to have a cup of Lassi, a popular traditional yoghurt drink. I enjoy the glass of Lassi as they were refreshing and not too sweet.Mango Lassi - $4.50With many of my Indian friends mentioning that Gayatri Restaurant is a better choice, I can't agree further. I hope to be back for more food one day.","1527":"delicious, but a tad bit too spicy for me, as I'm not used to eating too much heavy indian food. but really worth it. it came up to about $20\/pax with the 6 of us adults, sharing about 4-5 dishes of meat and vegetables.","1528":"Good for late diners - last orders are at 10.30pm. The menu is very large - comes in an ipad.The food is decent and it's not pricey. The fish head is nice but I prefer the one at Sakunthala's which has slices of lemons in it. More serviceable than a destination eatery","1529":"We wanted to go to the Banana Leaf Apollo for their fish head curry but came to this restaurant by accident, the outside looks similar. The service and food were very good. The price is lower for Monday and Wednesday \u00c2\u00a0Will definitely come back again.","1530":"looking around for the local fish head curry broth we stumbled at Gayatri's to try it. it was decent but maybe i prefer coconut milk based curry because the spice was hot and not soothing or smooth. it was just hot spicy broth that i didn't want to drink afterward or even eat with my rice. the cool part about eating here was the service buttons you can press on the table to bring your check etc. we came mid day so it wasn't too busy and FYI- your clothes will have a strong stench after the meal! the mango lassi drink was by far the tastiest i've ever had although i haven't had too many.","1531":"First things first - Good filter coffee. Food wise - very similar to other places along the same road. \u00c2\u00a0Decent north indian options as well but the butter chicken is with chicken on the bone which is bit of an inconvenience.Prices are cheaper than Banana leaf or Muthu but taste wise, spices are stronger but not the chilli which makes it very Indian and not too localised.","1532":"I've tried many dishes at Gayatri, and honestly, none of them are worth mentioning. the food is pretty average, and can be a little pricey for what they are serving.The only thing I come for nowadays is the Fish Head Curry, and I normally have that with Briyani rice or just plain rice.I love the fish head curry here. It comes in a large pot, still bubbling, full of spices and amazing herbs. The curry is thick and spicy, with a hint of sourness that balances the whole dish nicely. It also comes with lots of vegetables and pineapples in it.I can tell immediately if a fish head isn't fresh, and I've never had a bad fish head here. The meat remains moist and tasty, and the gelatinous parts of the head area \u00c2\u00a0real treat.To quell the fire in your mouth, you can have the free flow onion in a yoghurt sauce, or try the mango lassi, which is also pretty good. It's not too sweet, and it takes some of the heat off.They have a promotional price on Mondays and Wednesdays for fish head, so make sure you pop in for that deal!","1533":"I absolutely loved dining at this restaurant. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They serve the food quickly and efficiently.","1534":"Some Indian friends recommended me this restaurant after I asked for suggestions for banana leaf places. Served on a banana leaf atop a tray, the variety at the restaurant is wide but unfortunately the food disappoints. The portions are tiny and the food quality is not fantastic. It feels as though they made the curry a few days ago and the ingredients are not fresh and maybe even reheated. The interior of the restaurant looks much better than Samy's curry, but for an overall good experience, maybe you might want to look somewhere else.","1535":"Love the curry fish head and chicken dum briyani... The naan goes very well with the butter chicken ... would really want to go there again ...great service and superb food...","1536":"Loved this place for the 3 years we were in Singapore.the only decent place with a good variety of meat combinations with southindian dishes. Like my favorite iddli and pepper chicken. Briyani is good. Even my wife lived the mock mutton curry as a veggie.","1537":"First of all this place is probably more $$, at most $$ and half not $$$. We ended up paying SG$150 for 4, but there was a lot of food and plenty of beer. Without beer it would've been SG$40 less. One panful of pork (knuckles, ribs, roast veg) and rosti, pommes de terre wedges and sauerkraut. Great value if you ask me. There was just too much food and we ended taking home about 1\/4 of the food.The food was delish, although the sauerkraut wasn't as good as I expected (then again I'm no sauerkraut connoisseur, and this may be what good sauerkraut was supposed to taste like). Meat was especially outstanding although the brown sauce could've been thicker.View (of Sentosa) was fantastic and the waitstaff were extremely diligent\/attentive. The main waiter even explained how we could attain the 10% discount immediately (buy\/preload a loyalty card and then register online using their free wifi and then pay using the card (supplement w credit card if insufficient) after the meal). Best meal since I returned to Singapore a month and a half ago!!","1538":"i had the worst experience here!!!!!!we ordered a lunch dish that was supposed to come with an appetizer. After eating for a bit, we realized we never got our appetizer so we asked about it.The server said we do not get it because we ordered from a \"different menu.\" Not knowing what that meant, we asked if ours is cheaper or had bigger portions.The server responded saying it's exactly the same.So i asked why we dont get an appetizer then and she said because we pointed at a \"different menu\" and gave us SO MUCH ATTITUDEWHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!so stupid. never going back.","1539":"We come here quite often, the location on sentosa boardwalk is good and you can sit outside by the sea. Usually we have the platters and beer. The platter is tasty with generous servings, and pretty good price too. Of course they also have a good range of beer.","1540":"Disappointed with the curry wurst and gluhwein. gluhwein should be kind of heady, intense, festive; sugar on the rim cheapens it, makes it just a fruity drink, even moreso than sangria.fries with curry wurst were served too hot, and the curry sauce just tasted like ketchup. basically it tasted like a naked hotdog with cumin, and a pitifully small salad.it was all thoroughly mediocre and hard to justify given the prices.the beer was good and the location could be nice of you sit outside. but \u00c2\u00a0the food","1541":"The seafood salad was delicious! Though it was a \"regular\" portion, it came with generous amounts of leafy greens and seafood. The smoked salmon was also not salty which is always a plus!The black forest ham fladden was also a good choice. The ham was not too salty and complemented well with the rocket greens. The service however was really slow as they were understaffed and some of our special requests for our order were forgotten.","1542":"We particularly like this particular Brotzeit outlet because it's by the water and seems more laidback than the ones in town. We love the sausage platter and the pork knuckle ... the crisp skin is amazing! The mashed potato is really yummy and the sauerkraut does a good job of providing some contrast in taste to the meat overdose.Dad likes the beers quite a bit and they have interesting fruit beers like mango and banana ... light enough for the ladies who aren't into the heavier stuff.","1543":"have always been a fan of Brotzeit and they never disappoint! even after all these years.went for dinner at 5pm on a Tuesday evening, and ordered a platter with the famous pork knuckle, schnitzel and sausages. you also get a choice of two sides. if this is your first time dining here, i recommend to order the platter (:as the pork knuckle takes a longer time to cook, they offered to bring out the schnitzel and sausages first. i liked that they informed us about this. the staff are friendly and attentive.","1544":"I often go down to Brozeit for my monthly tarot group gatherings (yes, my tarot group books a section of Brozeit and you'll see a group of people discussing tarot card, buying tarot cards and doing \u00c2\u00a0practice tarot readings). Most of the time, my friends orders their beer there which they claim is one of the best. For me, I settled for their tea and I'm a big fan of their mashed potatoes and potato wedges. Just something about it that makes it so yummy. Their main dishes are HUGE, so don't say you have not been warned. The ambiance here is lovely as it is facing RWS so the view is often unobstructed if you request for outdoor seating. It's a nice place to chill out with friends or a significant other if you are around the area.","1545":"I spent two months in Singapore and since my Singaporean friends always took me out to their favourite places I needed to show them some German food. I hadn't been to Brotzeit before and was hoping for good, non-touristy dishes. Most of the dishes were Bavarian which is a false representation for Germany. But I still liked them and thought they were well chosen and prepared. One of my friends is vegetarian and we got Schupfnudeln with cheese. He loved it and later returned with other friends for Kaiserschmarrn (shredded pancake). I'd bring friends there again. If I was in Singapore...","1546":"As usual i stopped in the vivocity location and it was great. nothing like good german beer and food. \u00c2\u00a0I highly recommend the pork knuckle which was prepared perfectly. \u00c2\u00a0Crispy on the outside and falling off the bone soft on theinside","1547":"So I was here for junk food and dessert one day (yes, yes, a sausage place for dessert, what was I thinking - but hey, I do these things so you don't have to!). Ordered up some stuff to share, namely the fried camembert and shredded pancake. The fried cheese was nothing out of the ordinary, being crumb coated and served with a tart cranberry sauce. The shredded pancake, on the other hand, was way out of what I'd expected. I was imagining delicate strands of pancake, not unlike rosti but what was plated couldn't be further away from my own imagery. It was more of roughly cut as opposed to shredded, and dusted liberally with icing sugar. Kinda tastes like egg sponge cake, or kueh, given it's dense texture. The accompanying plum sauce was tangy, and overall, I found it a little too weird for my liking. Service is brisk and although the place gets terribly crowded, you're still assured of prompt service and regular refills of water.","1548":"Whenever I'm missing my days spent roaming Europe, I go to Brotzeit German Bier Bar. While it definitely pales in comparison to the authentic european experience, the casual laid back vibe here takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the daily grind for a few moments. Of course, a great pint of chilled beer can only add to one's enjoyment. Their house pours are really yummy. Not an avid beer fan, I tend to shy away from most brands of beers but I love their Erdinger beer, slightly fruity and light, it is a brilliantly refreshing drink to end the day with. They do fantastic bratwurst and sauerkraut as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food there. However, my dining companion's chicken schnitzel was too dry. The service staff are also very friendly and patient, offering their recommendation on beers and dishes if you have any problems ordering. The last time I was there, they had a television screening a football match, so it can get pretty rowdy when a certain sport event is going on (especially football). Other than that, this is a pretty ideal place to end the day at, unwinding from work with a pint of beer and some german delicacies.","1549":"Wife likes this place for their Greek salad. I like it for the varieties of beer on tap that are not named Tiger or Heineken. The lighter beers like Weissbier and lager obviously go down easier in the Singapore weather, but it is also nice to occasionally quaff a glass of the darker (Dunkel) brews.The sausage platters are not half bad either - good quality meat and sides - sauerkraut, potato wedges and mashed potatoes are some of the options. The garlic sausage and curry wurst particularly stood out in my mind.","1550":"3.8 stars. Our food was kind of cold but it was good. Hilariously, beers get monotonically more expensive over the course of an evening.","1551":"A good chillout place, celebrated my friend's birthday! Pork knuckle platter is good for 3 of us though it was recommended for 4! Yummy Crispy Skin! Service was a bit slow when the place is filled! Overall, a satisfactory visit.","1552":"For me, the best fish head curry in Singapore. Yes, it may sound like I have lost it but the sweet and tangy flavour that they create is better than over spiced version that race course road creates.Another thing that goes well for this place is that its an economy rice place so you can try it with other dishes and there is option of having the same curry with a fillet when you are dining alone.They even just give the curry for free as a side along with your economy rice order. I can just order one veggie, one egg and have the free serving of a small bowl of curry for a very economical and happy meal :)Nice place in CBD that is always popular and now they are even open for dinner and on Saturday as well.","1553":"This is THE place to go for fish head curry! The fish is fresh, the eyeball is still there, and it comes in a giant bubbling pot, with a bunch of other veggies. Goes great with other side dishes like the fried egg, kang kong, and crispy pork!Definitely a great family style meal!","1554":"This place is very crowded during lunch time so be prepared to wait if you come in a group. But it's so worth it! As the outlet name suggests, the fish curry is what rocks socks over here. You can also order other side dishes to go with the fish curry, I'd recommend the sweet and sour pork, as well as the kangkung. They're also open for dinner on weekdays and I come here regularly to tapao whenever I need to stay late for work.","1555":"I knew curry fish head was popular in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0For some reason a part of me just didn't want to believe it could be good. \u00c2\u00a0The first thing that comes to mind is fishy flavored curry. \u00c2\u00a0That just doesn't appeal to me. \u00c2\u00a0My husband is a food fanatic, so we had to find curry fish head. \u00c2\u00a0Originally we had not planned to go to Ocean Curry Fish Head. \u00c2\u00a0We happen to pass by upon going to Amoy food court. \u00c2\u00a0We saw a long line outside Ocean Curry Fish Head. \u00c2\u00a0After we finished lunch at Amoy food court we decided that Ocean Curry Fish Head was calling for us. \u00c2\u00a0Luckily the line had diminished. \u00c2\u00a0I requested to sit inside, but for some reason they made us sit outside. \u00c2\u00a0Rude, but I had no energy to care from the all the heat and walking we had done. \u00c2\u00a0The curry came out in a large stone pot. \u00c2\u00a0We each had our own bowl of rice. \u00c2\u00a0I was truly amazing. \u00c2\u00a0There wasn't even the slightest fishy taste. I was very impressed. \u00c2\u00a0I would have loved to have another meal at Ocean Curry Fish Head!","1556":"when ever i come to Singapore i need to go here for a Curry fish head. this is my favourit restaurant for this. The fish is always fresh, delivery fast and a nice place. please keep doing like this","1557":"Excellent and relatively cheap Chinese restaurant that specializes in, yes, you guessed it, fish head curry, one of Singapores delicatessen. This is not a place to go on your own, but rather with a company of 4 people or more: the curry comes in sizzling hot stone vessels and is quite big. Next to the curry, they also serve octopus (beautifully tender), fishcake, mutton curry. It may be crowded! There are 3 more of these restaurants in town, but this is the one I went to.","1558":"Never thought I could enjoy eating salad until I tried the salad here. A colleague of mine dragged me to this place - with $5.40 you'll get lettuce (greens), 5 toppings, and 2 salad dressings. This is such a deal. The portion is big for one person. If you'd like to top of some kind of meat (they have choice of turkey, beef, chicken, tuna, ham), you just need to top up another 0.50. They'd give you a really generous amount of meat.They also sell freshly cut fruits and fruit juice (no sugar) at reasonable price (i.e. sweet potato: $2.50, pomegranate: $3.50 | juice: $2.50 for watermelon juice, $3 for papaya juice, etc).The reason why I gave this place 4 starts instead of 5 is because service is sometimes not pleasant at all. The server would give you a scowl when you're taking more than 3 seconds to decide your toppings.","1559":"Our go-to butchery in Singapore, and they recently moved just across the street! the new butchery is HUGE- it has a small outdoor playground for bored kids to play outside, while the parents shop their meat goodness for the week in a two-storey building with the elevator. \u00c2\u00a0Not sure if we liked the layout though- if the butchery had more of a \"cozy\" and \"welcoming\" feeling, this new place seems more like a meat factory in an industrial setting and can get a bit confusing trying to find the entrance\/exit. I usually get my cut of korean samgyupsal here (pork bbq), and steak to eat for dinner. We seem to get better cuts if we come earlier, as we had slices of the most tender steak one week, then a bit chewy and forgettable meat, the next. so come early! i deducted one star for having very little selection of organic meat available for my baby.","1560":"One of our favourite places to go for a meal during the weekend. Can be hot outside and may take up to 20 minutes if you want a table inside. Staff are very friendly and the food excellent! The aged beef burger and the meatloaf are must try dishes.","1561":"New store layout is bad. As I'm writing there is a guy is asking the restaurant waitress if the store is closed. And now even another guy roaming the ground floor with a confused face. Haha Btw the \"meatloaf\" at the restaurant is a over sized spam that tastes like hotdog. Sheesh","1562":"Okay rating based on their cafe. The burger is so so. It's more of a Salisbury steak or am I nuts? I think a red flag is they don't ask how you want it cooked. The flavors aren't bad but it's not what I expected. The roast beef sandwich is too dry. Why do you do a hard cheese like Parmesan? You're better off with a soft cheese for better texture. Actually the sauce was nice. \u00c2\u00a0Either be generous with the sauce and toss with the lettuce or put it on the side so it doesn't disappear. Or that beef needs to be a little more rare. It's just so dry with toasted bread, hard cheese, and full cooked roast beef. Maybe the only dry thing in singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The fries is exactly this...they are dumpster diving at Mcd's. The taste temp and texture is of a 24hr old mcd's french fries. It's not expensive and if the day is nice, it can be a comfortable sitting outside on its patio. That's the charm imo. Plus the actual butchery is amazing.","1563":"Amazing market and Bavarian themed al fresco dining with meat heavy, but affordable menu. Paulaner 0.5L drafts are $12 and served in a proper glass. The only drawback in the whole experience is that the bistro service takes an eternity. The staff, although pleasant, can't be bothered to come to a table more than once. So make sure you get everything ordered at the first contact because you are on your own after that. The dedicated playground next door makes for a nice family experience. Butcher closes promptly @ 19:00.","1564":"I heard a great hype about this place from my uncle and decided to give it a try. Yes! It was good, high quality steak matched with high quality ingredients but that was basically it. No umph, no kick! Nothing remarkable. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed the food but it was not my favourite steakhouse . However, I can't say the same with service. At first they greeted us with open arms but when they came to realise that we were to stay abit longer, they grew impatient and gave us a sour face. Other than 3 stars from me~","1565":"When i get the opportunity to go to Huber's i feel like a little kids on Christmas morning! \u00c2\u00a0Upon entering the doors you can hear the angels singing that sweet hyme of butcher greatness!!!i know that it is expensive, but this is Singapore and they have never steered us wrong. \u00c2\u00a0all of the guys that have ever helped us out have been super knowledgeable and provide any advice if you ask. \u00c2\u00a0i am a big fan of being able to have them cut the steak to the right size and package however you want them to. \u00c2\u00a0i also love the little cafe the menu is very german but tasty. \u00c2\u00a0everything that we have ever had has been great, and how can you beat wonder heve beer on tap al fresco?!","1566":"Don't eat a misteak!Now I know that the above quote rightly belongs to Philly's own Pat's King of Steaks, but I hope they'll allow me to use it to aptly describe Huber's!Although I love cows and I think they are cute and gentle, I will admit they are absolutely delicious. (But if I had to kill my own meat to survive, I'd probably turn pescatarian. :P) It makes me happy to know that there is a quality butcher here in Singapore that I can rely on when I feel like being fancy by making my own steak.The store is in a great location, as it's the first thing you see if you exit Holland Road onto Dempsey Road. As fellow reviewer Mark D. said, it's quite pristine! The store is a well lit, organized meat heaven. When you walk in, you are greeted with a ton of beef, chicken, and pork to choose from- steaks, sausages, burger patties, you name it. I also like how the employees who work the counters are always attentive and willing to help. I've bought their Australian steaks twice and enjoyed them both times. Outside of the meat, the rest of the store caters to Western tastes. They have a small section for veggies\/herbs, a decent selection of cheese, along with bottled beers and other condiments. The bistro is outside, so al fresco dining is your only option. My husband and I ordered their burger with gruyere and caramelized onions. To be honest, we thought it was just okay. We actually think Go-Go Bambini (also in Dempsey) has the better burger. If you feel you've eaten some \"misteaks\" in Singapore, then stop by here; you won't be disappointed! :)","1567":"UPDATE:After being a customer of this place for quite some time, I regrettably have to amend my positive review below.I cannot recommend for anyone to eat at their Bistro, and if you do, know that it's at your own risk!Today I went there for lunch and was served RAW sausages - and I mean red and bleeding in the middle. \u00c2\u00a0Serving raw meat to a visibly (8 months) pregnant woman, and then not even offering to take it off the bill, is not a place that I can recommend to anyone.I am extremely disappointed - I have emailed them and gotten no response, and the waitstaff did not seem to get how dangerous the situation was either.It's a real shame but it seems this place has gone steadily downhill, at least when it comes to their Bistro.--This is by far the best place to buy meat in Singapore!The shop recently moved to a bigger, two-storey location on the hill on Dempsey Road, with two separate car parks, and it couldn't be better! \u00c2\u00a0Everything is more spread out and easier to find, and I believe they've added more variety as well - the shop also looks a lot nicer.The Butchery:The meat here has never been a disappointment. \u00c2\u00a0We have gotten everything from mince, cold cuts, parma ham, chicken, sausages, burgers, kebabs, and they have all been absolutely lovely. \u00c2\u00a0The price is of course on the higher side, but you know whether the meat is coming from and you pay for a very high level of quality! \u00c2\u00a0Even the vegetables and herbs are of a great quality, but I do think they're ridiculously overpriced. \u00c2\u00a0I would definitely recommend to buy meat here but advise to buy veggies somewhere else!The Bistro:This has gotten a huge improvement as well! \u00c2\u00a0It is on the ground floor, in a bit of an alcove, with minimal indoor and mostly outdoor seating. \u00c2\u00a0The cafe is all in the shade, and in a very pleasant location - there is also a convenient playground next to it, so its great for kids. \u00c2\u00a0I see many families having lunch hereThe food is awesome! \u00c2\u00a0I highly recommend the currywurst, which comes with a lovely sauce and very tasty little chips! \u00c2\u00a0There is also a nice selection of beer. \u00c2\u00a0A perfect lunch spot!Overall, I love this place. \u00c2\u00a0It was a great discovery, the quality of the food is top-notch, and you know that despite the price, it will be worth it in taste and superior to anywhere else!","1568":"This is a review of a shopping trip to Huber's Butchery.I had been wanting to visit Huber's to purchase some meat for home cooking. \u00c2\u00a0I had wandered in once before with some colleagues and just looked around. \u00c2\u00a0I knew I would be back.The place is spotless. \u00c2\u00a0They have a very wide selection of meats and can cut many things to order.tinyurl.com\/cfrv5odtinyurl.com\/bnrzbhktinyurl.com\/d9yxhuptinyurl.com\/cul7rytAll of the meats look of the highest quality. \u00c2\u00a0 The only real drawback is that it certainly isn't cheap. \u00c2\u00a0It is the most expensive meat I've ever purchased.The staff is beyond friendly and helpful. \u00c2\u00a0They were simply amazing. \u00c2\u00a0They answered all of my questions. \u00c2\u00a0They were friendly throughout the process.Beyond meat, the shop does sell other things to round out a meal. \u00c2\u00a0They have a small selection of vegetables and fruits. \u00c2\u00a0They have some sauces and condiments. \u00c2\u00a0They have breads and buns. \u00c2\u00a0They have a nice selection of beers.Along with some odds and ends, I purchased:1.5 kg sirloin for roasting ($90)tinyurl.com\/btwc326 lb pork shoulder for making pulled pork ($67.65)tinyurl.com\/cpe5bsw2 kg whole chicken for roasting ($24)tinyurl.com\/cnc2l4lAll of the meats were expertly packed and wrapped.Receipt: $237.65tinyurl.com\/c86voa4When prepared at home, all of the meats were as good as they looked. \u00c2\u00a0 Huber's is a very professionally operated butchery with a great selection of meats. \u00c2\u00a0For me, it is too expensive for everyday cooking. \u00c2\u00a0But for splurging here and there, it is a great luxury to have available. \u00c2\u00a0 As an additional note, they do offer delivery.","1569":"Stopped by here to grab our protein for the week. Whole chicken, bacon, bacon wrapped dates, sliced ham, ground beef. We're now stocked. The prices were reasonable, but on definitely on the higher end of our budget - have I mentioned how cheap I am? We sat down for a bite before starting our shopping. We didn't come soon enough to get the chicken meal. Pretty darn Paleo, minus the fries which could be easily substituted. Instead, we opted for the short rib and my oh my, was it delicious. I'd still go for the chicken next time we're there (if they have it), but if you're down for a more indulgent meal, I'd say give it a shot. We had two ciders to go with our meal. I ordered a pear cider and hubby got the lime cider. There was beverage envy, but I was pretty stingy and didn't share too much because it was so good. We'll be back. This place's meats make me seem like an amazing cook. Bacon wrapped dates with a roasted, seasoned chicken and a side of roasted cauliflower? I could win any Paleo man's heart with this meal - luckily, I already have the hubby's. :)","1570":"we drove here for just the iberico ham, swiss raw bacon & cold cuts. good selection, will be back again.butbreakfast at the bistro was unimpressive, and they don't serve tap water.","1571":"I think it should be listed as two things: butchery and bistro separately. The bistro is nice, it's a mix of European cousin, predominantly German, tastes good, the price is okay. Nothing special.The butchery is a very pretentious fancy place for people who are okay with buying ungodly expensive meat. Yeah, yeah, the butcher can cut it any way you like but for that price he really should sing and dance for you as well. The quality of meat is not better than if you just go to a regular wet market (well, hello, it's Singapore, the quality is superb anywhere) but the variety is better. So if you wanna play a really rich Julia Child and go handpick some meat for your beef bourguignon and chat with a butcher then go ahead.","1572":"The design of the new shop at 22 Dempsey Road could not be worse. There is an steady stream of customers trying to get into the store on the ground floor (where the parking lot is) but not being allowed to do so because it is an \"exit.\" You are forced to take an unnecessarily long and indirect walk up to the second floor to enter and then take an elevator to go down one floor to get the the meat section.Customer convenience was not a consideration when they designed how to get into the store or to get around once you do get in. Absolutely crazy.","1573":"Butcheries are my favourite stores to visit, next to supermarkets. Fresh, great cuts of meat with all sorts of herbs, potatoes, tomatoes, onions to cook them with, this place is like a candy store to steaklovers - wait - like a butchery to a steaklover. Okay analogy lost, but you get my point. Feast your eyes, or have a US ribeye to devour at the al fresco bistro. Be warned though that the grill masters are rather inconsistent, sometimes a medium steak turns out exactly pink in the middle like it should be, sometimes it's brown and well done in some parts, and medium only in 20% of it. No one experience has been the same for me, but it's good enough for $28-ish, it scratches the itch without breaking the bank.They serve their steak the way purists like them, no sauce, some salt and with good shoestring fries and some greens. I've never paid much attention to anything else on the menu. I do fancy the french onion soup now and then, but it doesn't quite compare to the thick intense concoction (blanketed by gruyere cheese) that I've had in better French restaurants. Still, a bistro's a bistro, adjust expectations and you'll be a happy diner here.Note that bistro hours differ from the butchery's. Bistro's operating hours as follows:Monday: Closed Tuesday to Friday: 11.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. \u00c2\u00a0Saturday, Sunday & public holiday: 9.30 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. Both butchery and bistro are closed on Christmas Day, New Year's Day and Lunar New Year.","1574":"If you like good meat, and if you like to cook good meat, this place is heaven. Beautiful cuts of meat all round. You can even find home cured bacon. Meat heaven. Vegetarians stay away.","1575":"Worst customer service ever. \u00c2\u00a0Been trying to reach the store for days but in vain. \u00c2\u00a0No one picks up the phone and no replies to email inquiries either. \u00c2\u00a0If you call during non-business hours then you get a recorded message, if you call during business hours then the phone just keeps ringing until it eventually gets disconnected.","1576":"Still a great offering of fine meats, but the new location is way too big and impersonal, and the bistro isn't open in the morning when the main shop opens. Such a shame, I hate to say it but I hope that they end up having to downsize and end up going back to their deli-style roots.","1577":"One of the best lasagne I've ever had in my life, rich and packed with meat which is what most lasagne lack. I was after a beef lasagne but Huber's only had a chicken option on that day and I thought why not give it a shot. It is definitely a lighter and healthier alternative to beef, the chicken used is shredded and not minced which gives a superb texture especially with the pasta sheets and creamy cheese. I 've tried to request for the chicken lasagne recently but with no luck. Hopefully it will be available the next time I drop by. The name of the place is a dead give away but if you're looking for prime cuts of meat and their related seasoning, this is the place to go to!! From angus to wagyu, you name it, Huber's got it!","1578":"We came to have the lunch buffet here as it was under Burpple's one for one. We didn't know that it was the Hotel's restaurant so it was a pleasant surprise. It overlooks the hotel pool as well so it was a nice environment. We were always greeted with really friendly service staff which made the experience nice. I won't say that there is a large variety of food but it suffices for the scale of the restaurant. Wished there were more international choices though The food is good as well especially the carved meats that they have.","1579":"Kuriya is one of my favorite Sushi destinations in Singapore. The place is elegant, the service impeccable, and the fish was recently swimming. Very fresh! My husband said his Uni was probably the best he's ever had. For me, the way the Chawanmushi was prepared and served was an absolutely joy. We ordered several dishes, for fear of missing out, and everything was delicious. Can't wait to go back!","1580":"Suitable for business lunches and corporate events. Reserved a place for business lunch and the service was excellent. Very easy access as you can walk in directly from the drop off point at the Office tower location.","1581":"Fantastic fresh fish! \u00c2\u00a0Visiting from my current abode in a land of dubious food preparation, fresh seafood was definitely high on my list when visiting Singapore.Simple high-quality sushi and sashimi. \u00c2\u00a0That's what I wanted, and that's what I got. \u00c2\u00a0Sake, Hamachi, Hotate, Madai, Unagi--all very tasty. \u00c2\u00a0I did play with the rolls a little bit, trying a Dragon Roll in one visit (enormous) and a Foie Gras roll in another (interesting) though the basic fish is the star.The atmosphere is brightly lit, vibrant, and open. \u00c2\u00a0They open early for lunch and fill up by about noon--it seems a popular place. \u00c2\u00a0They did have the sushi conveyer belt and while I sat at one for a few moments, I felt the stuff going by wasn't the best of their offerings, so I just ordered off the menu.","1582":"On the pricey side but the atmosphere is pleasant and the food is high quality. The service could have been better. We were a table of four and one person's lunch set arrived 20 minutes before the others. Agree that Kuriya is one of the better sushi restaurants in Singapore.","1583":"I love Kuriya Dining! It's my default dining destination if I happen to be at Great World CIty and have some time to spare. A meal at Kuriya is to be enjoyed at leisure, to rush through it would do neither you nor the chef justice. We got the edamame (really fresh and plump), selection of sushi (very fresh) and some yakitori items (grilled prawn, scallop and wagyu beef), king crab (sweet but a bit difficult to extract) with plum sauce, uni egg rice in claypot (seasonal item), dobinmushi (really tasty) and chawanmushi (really smooth) Everything was absolutely delicious, though I prefer the king crab at Hide Yamamoto.Service was really good and our server even offered to scrap the burnt parts of the uni egg rice for us if we liked. They also called to remind us of our reservation and the last order time, and were very lovely about it when we apologised for running late. Will definitely return!","1584":"Definitely one of the better Japanese restaurants I have had in Singapore, but it comes with a big pricetag. The sashimi is very fresh and their beef based items were really tasty. I particularly enjoyed the wagyu uni donburri and the wagyu curry udon. \u00c2\u00a0I would go back for these most definitely.","1585":"This is possibly one of the most consistent Japanese restaurants I have eaten at over the years and all the raw fish is always fresh and delicious. The service here is also impeccable and much better than many other Japanese places I've been to. Only thing is that it's not cheap, but it's worth the premium.","1586":"Very very fresh sashimi and delicious bento as well! I would say this is my daily to go jap restaurant, if not for its sky high prices! However, it is still worth going for special occasion to indulge in some splurging and pampering on your belly.","1587":"Easily one of the best Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Although a little on the pricey side, Kuriya knows how to serve up authentic and seasonal Japanese cuisine. Sashimi here is cut to perfection both in length and width ensuring adequate taste and portion. Wasabi here is grated fresh from the root and if you're lucky enough you just might get the end of the root to grate on your own when you request for more wasabi. A long time favorite on the menu and a personal favorite of mine would be the Miso Wagyu Beef which is served over a mini wooden Japanese stove. The beef grills atop a special kind of leaf which further enhances the flavor and visual experience. If you are lucky enough, do try the Matcha or green tea creme brulee \u00c2\u00a0which is out of this world tasty! It is a rare treat indeed, sometimes only with seasonal menus but it doesn't hurt to check with your server!","1588":"For the price, I would say that it's not one of the very best Japanese places around, but the experience here was very good and the food itself was quite satisfying. The feature here I think is the beef, which we had in a variety of settings, from donburi to grilled to shabu shabu style. The quality of the Wagyu was just amazing, which was extremely tender and had the right beef flavor. The raw fish items were fresh and pretty good quality, but I've had better and paid a lot less. The service was top notch however, and the server was extremely friendly and had a nice conversation with us.","1589":"Authentic food, good service, unreasonably priced! \u00c2\u00a0And the price is my only reason for the three starts. \u00c2\u00a0$200 per person for a tasting lunch menu, with just green tea. \u00c2\u00a0That cuts into celebrity Japanese chef (like Nobu or Morimoto) price range!","1590":"My favourite fine dining restaurant for Japanese food. Everything is top notch here from the food, ambiance right down to service. I particularly like the sashimis here as it is super fresh. Pricey but worth it!","1591":"Love the ramen here! Probably the best I've had in Singapore. I really like the toasted garlic flakes that are stacked with the condiments and utensils. The gyoza and karaage are also delicious. Staff is attentive and always fill your water as soon as it is low. We always see a server named Elaine here and she is always right on top of everything. The only gripe I've ever had at this particular location (United Square) is that the credit card machine can be incredibly slow and sometimes it isn't operational at all. Food 5\/5Service 5\/5Speed 5\/5Pros:-great and speedy service -delicious ramen -toasted garlic flakesCons:-credit card machine occasionally dysfunctional-no air conditioning (but still breezy)","1592":"Came by this ramen place and was not disappointed. Had the Ajitama Uma ramen which had bamboo shoots, egg and a strip of braised pork belly, Shoyu style. The aburi salmon was also very good. Will come back for more. No Miso soup base here though.","1593":"the declaration of bariuma spirits is once again proudly displayed for all to see.and once again, their numbering of these spirits is highly questionable!?and can they fulfill their promises here as well?1. we will energetically serve hot ramen.yes, they did!1. we will energetically greet with big & cheerful voice.yes, they did!1. we will energetically provide cheerful service.yes, they did!1. we will energetically provide brisk service.yes, they did!1. we will energetically clean up our restaurant till it shines.yes, they did!i did not drop my medicine on the floor this time around and so did not pop it into my mouth without hesitation.once again, the spirits were there but is it enough???surprisingly, the experience here was better than that at tanglin.the ramen broth somehow seems to taste better, not as porky tasting nor as shoyu laden as my last review for their tanglin outlet.maybe they have tweaked the recipe for their broth?nevertheless, it is still really rich and creamy, the way i like it.noodles are still al dentely executed.yakitori combo was again, surprisingly tastier than at tanglin.there was a nicer char and a more evenly layered basting of tare.having tried their gyozas for the first time, i would highly recommend them.pan fried crispy on one side, a soft skin contrast on the other and finally plump juicy meat filling bursting with flavours at the first bite.additionally, outdoor seating is available here and more importantly free wifi!for a better appreciation of the bari uma spirits, check this place out instead of their original tanglin branch!","1594":"This is my top 4 ramen places in Singapore. I must say that you can get quite a good range of ramen in Singapore.Bari Uma even has a noodle making machine and the noodle is thin and smooth. I especially like the char grilled char siew, which tastes delicious. The thick pork bone soup smells heavenly and one slurps leaves you wanting more. It is exceptionally great on a rainy day! This branch is not crowded at all. I don't know why. So I guess it is worth visiting when the famous ones in town are always having a long line.","1595":"It's not bad. I like the pork, but I wish they had miso ramen instead of just shoyu. Noodles can be hard medium or soft. Also got the dumplings, also not bad. I would give 3.5 so my 3 stars to average down the 4.","1596":"Good dumplings. \u00c2\u00a0Fried rice was so-so. \u00c2\u00a0Had better one at Singapore Seafood. \u00c2\u00a0Noodle dishes were excellent.","1597":"After having an amazing meal back in Hong Kong a few years back. I couldn't wait to get the chance to dine at one of the DTFs here in Singapore. My first time in HK, I remember ordering at least 4 orders of the incredible crab and pork XLB.After a long day at Universal Studios, and as we were exiting the park, my kiddo points out that there is a DTF. Without hesitation, we decided to have dinner before leaving. Here is what we ordered:- Crab & Pork XLB- Vegetable & Pork Dumplings- Stir Fried Garlic Pea Shoots- Fried Rice with Egg & PorkTo start, I ordered their watermelon juice. It was a huge disappointment. Wasn't very sweet and I felt forced to finish it just because I paid for it. All the contents of the Vegetable & Pork dumplings were packed in pretty dense and it was DRY!!! Not juicy at all. The pea shoots and fried rice were delish, no complaints. I almost fell asleep waiting for the crab and pork XLB. The restaurant wasn't even crowded. Upon first bite into one of these dumplings, it was not the same as I remembered. I can taste the crab but it had a fishy taste to it and the pork was DRY!! The skin was not silky smooth.My favorite part of the entire meal? The Mango Pudding and the Almond with Black Sesame. YUMMO!! I don't even want to waste my time and dine at another DTF at a different location before I leave.","1598":"TLDR; even if you've been to locations in other countries, try out the items that are exclusive to Asia\/Singapore. The wait for just one person took awhile but I did go during lunch hour on a weekend. This location is on Sentosa so expect a lot of tourists and families everywhere. Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry: I LOVE duck. So of course I had to try this out. It comes with 6 pieces and each piece was so crispy. It had a strong pepper flavor on the inside but I didn't mind it. It wasn't dry at all too. Steamed Chili Crab Bun: It's nice that you don't have to order a minimum amount of buns but I wish I ordered more. It's not spicy at all and this is coming from someone who thinks hot Cheetos are spicy. Definitely recommend this. Definitely recommend getting a few for yourself. I've been to the locations in Taiwan and USA so I didn't try items that I could get elsewhere. Not sure if the XLBs taste any different but I'd be willing to try when I come back again.","1599":"We chose to eat here one night for dinner (we had no idea this was a chain until we went to Taiwan...where it was much better)! The service was so rushed and unfriendly here. The food was okay but they didn't have half of the stuff I wanted so because it was rushed (there was a line outside waiting to get in, so I assume they're just trying to get customers in and out), I just ordered something that was...meh. I didn't have a positive experience here but the one in Taipei 101 was much better.","1600":"The custard bun was very tasty. The restaurant only makes 100 per day. The best dumpling was the truffle dumpling which was $5 for one dumpling which is reasonable I think. The award winning dumpling was underwhelming. We ordered 10pieces. We were excited to taste it but found it bland. The price overall was expensive. I found better tasting dumplings at a cheaper price elsewhere.","1601":"Beautiful location. \u00c2\u00a0No wait around 2 pm hour. \u00c2\u00a0Great Xiao Lung Baos and Shu mais. Friendly, efficient, attentive and quick service.","1602":"Best pork dumplings. Why wait 2 hours in line in LA, where they have an abundance of DTF in most Asian cities? No wait.You sit, you eat, and you're done in 40 minutes. Then you get to burn off those calories in the sweltering Singapore heat.","1603":"Kids: soup dumplings are our favorite. Also the fried pork. We like to watch the cooks make the dumplings. One rolls the dough, one adds the filling and one shapes the dumplings.Parents: we love Din Tai Fung. The food is wonderful and consistent wherever we go (we have been to DTF in 5 other countries). What's not so good is the price\/value and the wait can be long. If you're really hungry, order from the \"snacks\" list which comes out quickly.","1604":"It was my first time dining at a Din Tai Fung Restaurant. This happens to be in Sentosa and near the entrance of Universal Studios\/S.E.A. Aquarium. My husband and I just finished our self tour of the S.E.A. Aquarium and wanted something light to eat. We were seated at a table for four, but there's just the two of us, it just means more room for us. The server placed the menu and the order slip on the table for us as well. We ordered the Steamed Pork Dumplings (10 cts), Steamed Pork Buns (3 cts), and Steamed Sesame Buns (3 cts). Then realized that we had forgotten to order our drinks. We then asked the server for two hot Jasmine teas. The first order to come out were the dumplings! Which were porked filled and also filled with a soup broth. So when we bit into the dumplings the soup would escape out and tastes so wonderful. I really enjoyed the Steamed Pork Dumplings, it's definitely one of my favorites. Both sets of buns came out right after we finished the dumplings. The pork buns were decent, nothing too special, I did like the breading on it rather than the pork meat. The sesame buns were really good, according to my husband, but I was not a big fan of the sesame buns, since it was my first time trying that kind of paste. It's not something I would eat too often, but my husband said it was pretty good. Once we finished all our buns and teas, we went out to pay. The service was alright, but the refilling of hot tea was very good, since our teas were never empty. My husband mentioned that the servers could have been a bit more friendly. I really liked how they had several cooks\/dumpling makers in the see-through room making dumplings right in front of us. It's pretty neat and it shows how fresh each dumplings were when made to order. I would definitely like to come back for the Steamed Pork Dumpling. It was quite fun to eat, but could be seriously dangerous if you bit into one when it's super hot! Beware of hot, fresh dumplings! Take your time to eat them or just open the dumpling to release the soup before enjoying, if it is too hot to eat the whole thing at once.","1605":"Always amazing!! \u00c2\u00a0No trip is complete without a stop at Din Tai Fung for dumplings!! \u00c2\u00a0Fast service, amazing food, and good price ... what's not to love!? \u00c2\u00a0The Pork soup dumplings are the best around the world! \u00c2\u00a0Consistently great food and quality in presentation. \u00c2\u00a0Highly recommend!!","1606":"at least 10 locations just in singapore, and 5 stars for the crab pork dumpling, which is chili crab 40% larger campaign currently through Aug-Sept. \u00c2\u00a0some other different items like a chocolate lava bun. \u00c2\u00a0had some fried vegetable pork dumpling and noodle soup, no wait.","1607":"Din Tai Fung has consistently good food. Waitresses and staff are all business - almost like non human robots. Very efficiently run chain restaurant. Diners mark selections on a clipboard either while waiting for a table or immediately when seated. \u00c2\u00a0We go about once a month, all the locations are pretty consistent and we often tend to order the same things on each visit. \u00c2\u00a0Sliced Cucumbers with Garlic, Xiao Long Bao, \u00c2\u00a0Shrimp and Pork Dumplings, Shrimp and Pork Shumai, Pork Buns, Fried Rice with Fried Pork Chop, Wontons with Vinegar and Chili Oil are all extremely good.Today, we ate at the Resorts World Sentosa location. \u00c2\u00a0It's a large restaurant and geared for the large groups and tourists. \u00c2\u00a0Today, we waited about 10 minutes for a table. \u00c2\u00a0The number display was broken so the hostess had to shout out the numbers in a shrieking voice that was as annoying as the sound of a very loud dial up modem (I'm telling you - they're all robots!) \u00c2\u00a0 I believe the prices here are a little higher for the tourists. \u00c2\u00a0They also do not serve complimentary green tea after you are seated. \u00c2\u00a0The food today was a little better than normal DTF quality - meaning it was excellent.There is often a wait for a table so the trick is to arrive early before the peak rush. They open an hour earlier at 10am on weekends. \u00c2\u00a0Din Tai Fung is a great place to bring out of town visitors for dim sum. \u00c2\u00a0Even the most constipated westerner will find this food appealing.","1608":"Oh Din Tai Fung. I love you. The dumplings are always great. ALWAYS. Beautiful little thin skinned juicy pork dumplings full of soup and deliciousness. So so good. Also get the egg and prawn fried rice, wontons in black vinegar, spinach with garlic and the red bean with sticky rice. Service is solid. This location is busy because it's in a touristy spot, but the wait is worth it. Love it.","1609":"I have been to many restaurants of this chain but this one is by far the worst in terms of service! I asked for water refill many times and only got it after 15min. By the way, they charge for water. The food is of course good, but be wary of the waiting time. We ordered the Xiao Long Bao and it came as the last dish! The server told us that it needed another 8min to deliver because it needs 15min to cook but we ordered it 30min ago. I am very disappointed with the quality of service, will not come back to this location again.","1610":"It's a large space! Many, many round tables fit for large groups and families. Beef noodle soup was the best I've tried. The xiao long bao was yummy as well. I haven't tried the other branches in Asia or in California so I had no expectations or standards to measure this one up against. But going here after a full day at Universal Studios was a relief, to say the least. At the front, you just write out all the dishes (including water) you want on a sheet of paper and they bring it to you in a few minutes. I did notice it took a while for my boyfriend and I to get our server's attention.","1611":"Great food! Cant go wrong with anything if you're not picky but service needs improvement.","1612":"DTF's dishes are no doubt the best.But this one branch isn't just my favorite.","1613":"Dumplings here are bigger, juicier, and flavorful than the ones in USA. More menu selections. Haven't tried the other Asia branches to compare it with.","1614":"Almost invariably wonderful Din Tai Fung reduced to a very missable. Take a shrieking hostess on a 120 decibel PA system \u00c2\u00a0yelling numbers off a painfully long waitlist (mainly of wise guys who have long since deserted) - God save the unwitting who have decided to wait. Add inept manager and newer staff. And strange for DTF not their usually high standard of food. Far better idea to enjoy the delights at Malaysian Food Street next door, especially if is a warm or balmy day since the air-conditioning is just right. Or try something in the food stretch - Bali Thai and Ruyi sound good. Else maybe just go back into town to DTF at city hall, paragon (my favorite decor) or Wisma. If you do decide to stay, wait patiently and try get a seat in the much more pleasant dining area that is further inside and has more windows and open space. Try and enjoy but of course don't let this one color your view of DTF overall. Hopefully they'll sort it out.","1615":"Horrible customer service for sub-par food at this branch. \u00c2\u00a0Avoid this location.","1616":"Happy hours was till pretty late. Had the Belgian witt and chicken skewers. Brought a date and it was under 50 for our drinks and sides. Highly affordable, No 10% service charge. Oh, and they removed the rotating stools from the bench","1617":"Favorite neighborhood chill spot here. Good food and reasonable prices. Highly recommend the truffle fries over everything else, the portion size is huge. Good to munch on while you enjoy your nice beer or sparkling Prosecco.","1618":"Surprisingly empty when we visited on a Sunday afternoon at 12. Menu is intriguing and every plate was exquisitely plated - I watched the adjacent table order the granola with yogurt and fruits and it was extremely prettily plated. I had the eggs en cocotte ($19), which was satisfying but not mind blowing. Eggs were nicely poached, and I liked the doubanjiang hollandaise. The truffle mash was slightly hard and flavorless though - was not a fan. I really liked the jamon soldiers; they went really nicely with the luscious yolks. My friend had the chili crab scrambled eggs ($20). The corn cakes were creamy with intact corn kernels in them. The scrambled eggs tasted more like chili than the chili crab sauce (which probably contains more tomato). Also tried their interesting-sounding Organic Chai Soy Almond Latte ($7), which was not bad, but slightly too sweet for my liking. Total bill came up to $49.","1619":"I frequent Tuckshop often for its natural laid back atmosphere with their friendly wait staff who are usually prompt with their service! Food is delectable but too salty for most dishes.Drinks are my favorite section in their menu. I simply love the vibe it gives off with their consistent acceptable service for a casual laid back cafe!Location: 3\/5 (abit out of the way)Environment: 4\/5 (indoors)Environment: 5\/5 (outdoors)Food: 4\/5Drinks: 4\/5Service: 4\/5","1620":"We tried this place after reading reviews of how pet friendly it was in a Singapore Pets magazine. The following day we took one of our dogs to the Pet Expo at Changi exhibition centre. For a dog that was born feral he really did a great job coping with the huge throng of people and pets. After a couple of hours my patience had worn out more than his had and we decided to reward him with a trip here. Parking is at a premium in this area, so I left the old girl \u00c2\u00a0( my old Merc) with the valet parking attendant and watch him smoke the tires off into the distance. As we walked up, a member of staff told us that the NEA had paid them a visit and they were not allowed to be as dog friendly as they would like to be or the magazine article said. Oh Well. Not the best of starts.We got a table, actually an oil drum right on the edge of the outdoor area and perched precariously on some uncomfortably high stools with the dog just outside of the \"official \" \u00c2\u00a0restaurant outdoor area but close enough that many people paid attention to him. Anyway, back to the Tuckshop, yes the seats were uncomfortable but the place has a very good vibe and the Archipelago beers selection went down a treat. The Summer ale being our particular favorite. We just ordered appetizers to eat, Pan Seared Ribeye Tataki with Tomato Salsa and Poppodom and the Chicken Curry. Both were instant favorites for a return visit with hopefully the Roasted Chio Bak with Spice and Vinegar. Dip being back on the menu. We had left room for dessert, which is a choice of four different ice cream sandwiches served with a shot of Baileys with Milo Dinosaur powdered on the top. I had the marshmallow while my wife had the mint. Both were perfect with the Baileys and Milo Dinosaur powder being an unexpectedly good flavor of dessert. Our dog attracted lots more attention from both Locals and Expats as well as the staff who throughout were friendly and efficient without being too attentive. Shortly afterwards we summoned the Valet Parking attendant and before we knew it the old girl screamed into view. We headed home after having enjoyed our day, but not quite as much as our dog did. Note to management: please get the approval you need to make the Tuckshop pet friendly.","1621":"Nice place for beer. They have a lot of beer selection. The foods selection are good and tasty but slight pricey","1622":"A very nice relaxing downbeat bar. Didn't try the food. The food menu has a few good items albeit a bit short, nothing to really write home about.In a nice location with good outdoor seating. Great view of the creek right next to the bar. Laid back atmosphere in the evening.Great beer list, broad selection. Enough to keep you entertained on repeat visits. Cocktails could be a bit better.","1623":"The barley, pumpkin and egg salad was delicious and healthy, will definitely come back here!","1624":"It's a buzzy place by the road and the newly restored Geylang river if you will! Good neighborhood place to grab some cold bear they have a nice collection of archipelago draft beers & some bottled craft beer along with a decent wine list.For food there are some bar bites & tapas, whatever we had was good and so was the service & ambience. An asset for the neighborhood","1625":"Slow service, even sitting in plain view with few patrons. Staff could be better trained in attentiveness. Time from seating to beer: 20 minutes.","1626":"This is my favorite stall in Food Junction\/Bugis Junction.Sizzling hot food is a good thing. \u00c2\u00a0This is certainly sizzling hot. \u00c2\u00a0The staff is friendly and helpful. \u00c2\u00a0This takes a tad longer than many of the other stalls. \u00c2\u00a0But it is made fresh. \u00c2\u00a0Plus, it is often busy. \u00c2\u00a0But the wait is never really that long.I get the beef plate. \u00c2\u00a0The portion is pretty decent. \u00c2\u00a0 It is super hot and comes on a plate that helps keep it hot. \u00c2\u00a0 It is pretty simply. \u00c2\u00a0There is beef and rice along with the basic seasoning. \u00c2\u00a0There is a side of rice and some soup. \u00c2\u00a0It is all good. \u00c2\u00a0For a quick dinner with no frills, this does the trick for me.tinyurl.com\/8vftfjxFood Junction is very clean. \u00c2\u00a0Even when busy, there tends to always be seats. \u00c2\u00a0When you are carrying a tray with a hot sizzling platter, this is important.","1627":"First visit. Neighborhood restaurants like this one make me fall in love with Singapore's dining scene. This place has been around for many years and continues to be popular. now I know why - Fresh seafood cooked simply for customers. This is the focus - no chichi menu or fancy decor - just honest fresh seafood. 4 words = Home smoked ocean trout. This was delicious. Enticing nightly promos as well. I will return for oyster night and lobster night.","1628":"I live in the neighborhood and have eaten here several times. The food has always been high quality with decent service. I would definitely recommend the octopus, seafood basket and the scallop ciopino. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not entirely sure what is up with the negative reviews. Prices are equal or lower of other similar seafood restaurants in the area and the quality is generally better. I like the location as it's a quiet residential area rather than a busy commercial area like orchard. If you're in the Bukit Timah area definitely check it out.","1629":"Oysters are good, but service by the hosts and waiters is terrible. We had to wait more than 15 min for the host to even pay us attention and then no one took our order until we complained to the chef. We finally got our second dish... one hour later. Food tastes good, but I don't think that the wait is worth it. Suggestions are to buy the seafood to go or eat at another restaurant that has both good seafood and good service.","1630":"I've not dined in the Bistro, but I've bought seafood there numerous times after my mum found their shellfishes and fish really fresh. Being fish lovers, my mum would lovingly search for fresh fish at the market. But when we want 'ang moh' fishes, it may not be so easy to find it at local wet markets. Greenwood has a good variety and they advised my mother which fishes are suitable for grill for our barbeque once and after chatting, my mother ordered the next batch of fresh wild salmon from them. She grumbles that the farm bred ones have a taste and smell about them that loses the 'fishiness' that she likes about the oily fish. We also bought scallops which were fresh and they had quite good seasonal offerings.However, their prices are rather steep and unless it's for an occasion, it might be rather hefty to do groceries here on a daily\/ weekly basis.","1631":"The food was a hit-and-miss: oysters are a must-try, fish catches cooked in the style of grilling or pan-searing are a fail-safe, pastas are a hard pass, and squid, done any way, is a cannot miss.1) For oysters, Canadian Golden Mantle ($4) are best for people who love big bold flavours; whereas the Canadian Mary Point ($4) is for people with a sweet tooth, the Irish one ($4) will be preferred by people who like things delicate (this was my favourite), and the French Gillardeau ($8) is for people who think only good thigns come in big packages, which probably explains its double pricetag.2) Hot Seafood Platter ($99): a massive medley of half a Boston lobster, grilled prawns, fish skewers, NZ mussels with garlic, littleneck clams in white wine, char-grilled Mediterranean squid, oysters mornay with caramelised onions, grilled octopus in spicy vinaigrette mesclun, and fries. It looked a rustic mess, but was deliciously value-for-money. Standouts include the squid and octopus, both were executed flawlessly.3) Squid Ink Linguine ($21.95) - slicked with the moreish essence of squid ink: I liked that it was generously dotted with perfectly cooked calamari.4) Scallop Cioppino ($23.95): an unusual but wonderful combination of spinach pesto-ed spaghetti and spicy arrabiatta, but let down by overcooked rubbery scallops.5) White Truffle Linguine ($23.95) - white truffle tapenade swirled into parmesan cream, and flecked with shitake aplenty: waaaay too rich, this got cloying about halfway through.6) Char-Grilled Atlantic Halibut ($32.95): delicate and beautifully burnished, drizzled with a velvety herbed butter, and sided by grilled asparagus, broccoli and marinated cherry tomatoes. Fantastic stuff, even if I found a number of bones embedded within. 7) Pan-Seared Atlantic Cod ($29.95): perfectly flaky and luscious, and served with grilled zucchini, eggplant, broccoli, herbed cherry tomatoes, atop a bed of fluffy mash","1632":"The bistro is always crowded whenever I visit this place and so I always end up having takeaways (it is also significantly cheaper, $9.50 instead of $18, if you order and takeaway instead of eating there). I love the calamari here and it is one of my favorites in Singapore. The squid is very fresh and the batter is light and crisp. All that deep fried goodness is pretty indescribable. The fish was really fresh too but I found the batter a little too thick for my liking. They give a generous portion of fries which is always good for making the meal a satisfying one. Can't do without the carbs.Overall, they do one of the better fish and chips in town, but eating in is not really an option.","1633":"Higher end of 3 stars.Enjoyable but not great - that kind of sums up everything about the restaurant for me (ambiance, food, value etc...)My brother had a craving for fish and chips and had heard good things about greenwood so we decided to check it out. It's situated in the cluster of restaurants at Hillcrest Ave. Free valet which is convenient since finding parking there can be a headache.All of us just got fish and chips (though we also got salmon sashimi to start). I had the house fish and chips (battered) while the other 2 had the one the waiter recommended as the freshest that day (I forget the name). And really it was enjoyable but not great. And at $20+ for the basic and $30+ for the catch of the day, it just doesn't really seem worth it for 2 small pieces of fish.Was happy to try it once but I doubt I'd return (unless it's for this $1 oyster night other reviewers have mentioned)","1634":"This meal saved our visit to Sentosa! We arrived to Sentosa one Saturday afternoon hot, hungry, and without a plan. Hubby found Quayside Isle on a map and the name of a restaurant he'd read good reviews about. So we hopped in a cab to the W and then walked past all the restaurants to see what looked best. Decided on this one because we were in the mood for fresh seafood. We sat outside with a lovely view of the harbor and shared delicious appetizers, entrees, and wine. Service started off great and then dwindled throughout the night as the place got more crowded. But overall it was a good meal.","1635":"Probably not the best place for seafood in Singapore. They have a good selection but most of the seafood is from overseas and could be fresher. I'd recommend the octopus.","1636":"I've never sat and ate in the bistro before. Why? Because at just $7.95, you can take-away top-quality NZ white fish fillet with chips to munch on. The chili sauce is just too good to resist, and when paired with mayonaisse, this is certainly one of the best takeout fish'n'chips take out places in Singapore. Many living around the area can attest to that as it has become a favourite haunt for people who want to takeaway a scrumptious yet hassle-free meal.I have heard good things about their Bistro though, being housed in the picturesque Greenwood neighbourhood. However, I heard the prices were steep, and definitely not as worthwhile as taking away fish'n'chips. Good news for those with cars as complimentary valet service is provided for customers in this 'hard to find parking' area.","1637":"I don't know why some other reviewers gave only one or two stars. I absolutely loved their oysters. Great quality at reasonable prices. I had both the mornay and Thai chili and both are wonderful. This will be my go-to place for oysters in the future. Also had the chargrilled sea bass. Great moisture and fantastic seasoning.","1638":"Poor execution of what could have been a great restaurant. I had thought the whole point of having a restaurant arm for a fish market was to sell fresh seafood dishes, not dump whatever stale seafood they couldn't sell in the market to restaurant customers. The oysters were not fresh, we returned so many that we gave up on returning them in the end. This included oysters that were $7 a piece. Food was poorly seasoned and rubbery. We had the seafood platter to try a little bit of everything. Lobster, shrimp, clams, grilled oysters, octopus and squid just did not taste good. The platter was supposed to come with fish skewers and they switched it out for fish and chips without mentioning it at all. The kitchen was not well ventilated; everyone smelled like fried fish after the meal. Service was poor, we had to ask for tar tar sauce for fish and chips.","1639":"The service at this restaurant has gone from bad to worse. Ordered take out this evening and was told to collect in 15 minutes' time. We came at the time instructed but was made to wait another 40 minutes for our takeout.The auto olio was cooked and ready for collection but not the seafood platter or the fish and chips. Was told to wait another 3 minutes each time but waited close to a hour for the food. Totally bad showing and on top of everything, they kept giving all sorts of excuses for the delay. The manager that evening (Kailash, I believe) \u00c2\u00a0was a disaster hire....gave one excuse after another instead of an apology. Finally, I demanded a refund as he knew he was in trouble with me and quite a few other customers waiting for their take out.A few more of such evenings like tonite, Fish Market in greenwood will soon be another bygone restaurant at the Greenwood Avenue cluster of eateries.","1640":"I was always drawn to the fish market side of things and after a few times of casually walking past on different occasions, I decided to spend some money and take home some fresh seafood to cook. So, I bought about 1.5 kilos of fresh clams home and proceeded to cook up some dinner. It was disappointing to say the least. The clams were a whole lot of shell and a deceivingly little clam meat. Taste wise, there wasnt any natural sweetness to the clams. Given what I paid for the clams, Im definitely not going back there.","1641":"Having the most unpleasant experience at Geenwoodfishmarket Brought my family here for the oyster festival and after having 8 oysters, I wanted to try another 4 variants. The manager who served us Kailash insisted that I have to order each variant in pairs. No where on the menu stated this and during my last visit a week ago there was no such rule. Nowhere on the menu stated this and he rudely insisted that the rules have changed. They advertised 18 varieties and that was the draw of the festival! How unreasonable to insist that I have to order two each! So I asked to check with the owner and no one came back to explain! \u00c2\u00a0I totally do not see the rationale in this rule as oysters come individual, not pairs and because of this bad experience I am never coming back again.","1642":"To be honest, I've never eaten at this restaurant. What I do rather is call the restaurant to place an order for takeaway, before swinging by 20 minutes later to pick my food up. The pros of doing this: it's much cheaper than eating at the restaurant and you get to eat in the comfort of your own home. Plus, you still get the option of browsing whatever fresh fish they have, which is very handy, especially because they have recipe cards at the bistro, recommending different ways for you to cook your fish.","1643":"This place reminds me of the fresh seafood market in Sydney with the smell of ice, fresh fish and crustaceans. They are doing so well now that they have opened another bistro along the same street however my memories are with the old bistro which was more like a fish market with a restaurant in the back. The old bistro has a nautical theme with dim lighting against walls with posters of various fish and crustaceans. I guess with all the surrounding it does put you into a seafood mood. An appetizer that never disappoints is the pan seared Salmon Belly and Scallops. Well garnished and cooked to perfection, this appetizer is bound to please any crowd. For mains, you're spoilt for choice but I do personally recommend the Cod. Do check with your server for best method of cooking and for information on the catch of the day as well. I almost forgot the most exciting part, it is OYSTER NIGHT every Tuesday, a $1 an oyster(raw, freshly shucked).. But be warned, it's a crowded event so make your bookings early and go oyster crazy!","1644":"Beautiful food, friendly service, and great 2 for 1 lunch specials. This eatery does not disappoint. Tip: If you modify or try to substitute any of the dishes, it is no longer eligible for the 2 for 1 deal. We ordered a Caesar salad and asked for dressing on the side. The Romaine was crisp and fresh. The dressing was rich, full of flavor.We had the pizza with mushrooms and olives, the spaghetti al funghi, spaghetti bolognese, and the pasta carbonara. The pizza had a lovely crust, sauce and the ingredients were fresh. My niece slurped up every bit of spaghetti bolognese. The carbonara was good, but not the best I have had. My favorite entree was the lovely al funghi. I believe they had 3 different kinds of mushrooms and the sauce was so fragrant.Last but not least, the desserts were amazing. The gelato is freshly made with great flavors. The pistachio lava cake was rich and decadent and wonderfully balanced with the passionfruit sorbetto. The waffle with apple caramel was paired with chocolate gelato. Dessert was to die for. Thank you Chapter 55 for a fabulous meal.","1645":"Great place for their 1-for-1 weekday lunch promotion and it accommodated our group of about 12. No problems getting a seat at 11.30am on a Friday.Vongole spaghetti ($18) - 3.75 starsHearty, more clam shells than meat, but at half the price I'm not complaining.Strawberry gelato ($4.80) - 3 starsToo sweet after the first few spoons.","1646":"My group of girlfriends, a total party size of 8 decided to check out Chapter 55 at hipster land. So I called in to make a reservation, but an automated voice answering machine told me I would receive a text message to complete the reservation, which I did. It was a short URL to make a reservation via Chope. However on Chope, I could only select a maximum party size of 6. So in the comments I asked for 2 more seats.A few hours later I got a call saying that their cafe's reservation policy requires each person to spend at least $25 and order a main course. Waffles which are priced $18.50+ with 2 scoops of ice cream are not considered a main course. Even the staff encouraged me to walk in. This is ridiculous. So we decided to walk in, and the food better be worth the effort!Despite the phone call, I was delighted to be greeted by the beautiful ice cream display!And I pinched myself to be sure I wasn't dreaming when I saw the $23 per pint price tag. Okay, let's see if their ice cream is really twice as good as other competitors, to be priced this high.The interior has a very homely, retro feel to it, the lighting isn't instagram's best friend. You will have to improvise or try and get a table by the windows.1. Beef Bolognese Cheese Fries $15+With truffle tries price at $14, we decided to try something else. Sadly, this dish wasn't what we expected, even though there is supposedly cheese in the sauce. We couldn't taste any. It was a plate of very soggy fries, with a very under seasoned beef bolognese sauce.2. Squid Ink Risotto $25+Tasted cheesy and I felt gerlat very quickly. This is the first plate of Risotto that I didn't like, I am normally a huge fan of Risotto.It's waffle time! Despite the unsatisfying experience with the main courses, I was so certain the highly instagrammable waffles with ice cream would be the highlight of my night!3. Waffles with Mao shan wang durian and belgian chocolate $18.50+I liked that the durian ice cream colour wasn't overly yellow, which a lot of ice cream parlours, normally add yellow colouring to, it didn't smell very fragrant but it tasted good. I liked the durian ice cream. The Belgian chocolate tasted okay, it didn't leave an impression for me. The waffles, which I was looking forward to, tasted ok, I've definitely had better waffles in the surrounding area.4. Waffles with Pulut Hitam and Pistacchio $18.50+The only redeeming factor that Chatper 55 had for me tonight, was the Pulut Hitam ice cream, which I truly enjoyed. However not all the girls at my table liked it. It wasn't displayed, but they had it in the freezer. You could bite into the black rice bits in the ice cream. It a legit, pulut hitam ice cream! The Pistacchio was also a memorable ice cream flavour. You can distinctively taste the pistacchio.The bill for 6 girls and we weren't very big eaters, so asking all 6 of us to order a main course each isn't the wisest cafe policy, even from a business stand point.The staff weren't well organized and took a long while to clear our table. The first staff cleared one plate, and a male staff cleard 2 more plates. We were done with all our plates and when the waffles came, we still had half a table worth of dirty plates. Only after the second waffle came to our table, did another male staff who served us the waffles, clear the rest of the dirty dishes.The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite. I had higher hopes for their ice cream and waffles with such a high price tag on each plate. On the bright side, they have BOGO weekday lunch offers.wifi password : chapter55","1647":"My colleague who had accidentally ran into this bistro a week ago bugged us to accompany her soon to sample the food. So today, despite the heavy afternoon rain, we walked from our office to sought out the place. Walking along Eng Hoon Street, the restaurant was easily noticeable by the corner of Tiong Poh Road. It's pretty big. One thing that I found very attractive on their signboard was how they highlighted their \"1 for 1 on weekdays\" offer.We went as a group of 5. Seeing that the restaurant is not Halal-certified, I couldn't try out their main courses, hence I went with the desserts. Like one of the popular quotes that I snapped stated, \"Life is short. Eat dessert first!\"The appetizers came as bowls of mushroom soup. The mushrooms weren't in chunky forms but they were grounded in, which was nice!Two of my colleagues ordered one plate of white wine pasta (Vongole?) and the other, some sort of seafood pasta. Can't recall the names of the dishes, but both of them commented that the spices in both of their pastas were too overpowering; one even masked the white wine sauce. They also ordered buffalo wings (5 pieces). Personally, from what I see, those wings were overpriced. Such small pieces for $16?!Came my Salted Caramel Waffle and a glass of Black Cow. Funny names to give the floats: \"Black Cow\" for Coke Float and \"Snow White\" for Sprite Float. Well, as you can see from my waffle photo, I just loved the presentation. What a plating! Loved how they stenciled in cocoa powder of their logo at the corner of the plate. The waffle itself cost me $17 due to the fact that I opted for 2 scoops of ice-cream. Otherwise it would have been $15 for one. I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel and Hazelnut gelato on my waffle, while I got another scoop of Hersheys gelato for my coke float. Loved the waffle!We even sampled a teaspoon of some of the gelatos on display. I had the Salted Egg flavoured, Cotton Candy flavoured and Strawberry Cheesecake flavoured... Nice. But definitely, I have tasted better and creamier gelatos elsewhere.","1648":"Great food and chill atomosphere. Waffles and gelato were soooo good. \u00c2\u00a0Had chicken salad and risotto and both tasted great. Other food items look good as well.","1649":"This place opened late last year in December right before Christmas and occupied a spacious corner on Tiong Bahru Road. \u00c2\u00a0It is on way home and I noticed that it was always packed at night so I wanted to give it a try. \u00c2\u00a0We went for Sunday brunch and I have to say I was skeptical at first because their menu was so extensive. \u00c2\u00a0Usually when a restaurant is trying to offer everything it is a bad sign - on top of their brunch menu, they have a long list ranging from pasta to pizzas to risottos to appetizers and desserts (waffles, pancakes, gelatos). We ordered buffalo wings to share, I remember it being decent but not particularly authentic but on the spicy side. \u00c2\u00a0The dish that blew me away was one of their fresh pasta dishes. The sauce was AMAZING, it is very flavorful and seems to be saffron based. \u00c2\u00a0The seafood was very fresh, which is quite a rarity when eating out and reflects their attentiveness in sourcing ingredients. \u00c2\u00a0It is also very reasonably priced. \u00c2\u00a0To be honest, it was really out of my expectations. \u00c2\u00a0I later read from other reviews that the chef is from Pasta Brava - that explains it. \u00c2\u00a0Also read that its owner is the same as Ice Edge Cafe, a popular cafe in Kovan (ok too far for me so good they open one in TB). I tried a piece of the pizza that my friend was having, the crust was pretty good too. \u00c2\u00a0The pasta was really filling as the sauce was so rich, so I didn't have any room for desserts. \u00c2\u00a0 That is a pity though as they appears to serve a great selection of gelatos. \u00c2\u00a0 I read that they have a 1-for-1 pasta deal during weekday lunch time and that's a pretty good deal, I would totally take advantage of this if I work around Tiong Bahru. \u00c2\u00a0This is a pretty big space and can accommodate any group dining comfortably.","1650":"i like the one for one lunch deal even though there are limited choices for it.and you got to go there early to get a table if not you'll have to wait in line or sit outside in the heat of the day. my friend and I both had pizza; she ordered the bonito and i ordered the good old funghi pizza. it didn't leave me swooning but i'd say it's definitely one of the better pizzas i had in Singapore. the bonito was interesting to try but i am not sure if i want to order it again. pizzas are still better eaten the Italian way than fusion is my take on this. give me sausages, funghi and olives on a pizza anytime!!it was actually nice to have a gelato counter in store; the server was friendly and willing to give in to our undying want of trying almost all the flavors and then still smile at us as we try to make up our flippant minds. some were misses like the yuzu lacked the tangy taste i desire and the passion fruit mango was more like just mango. eventually i went for the belgium dark chocolate which i think is one flavor that could never go wrong and i was right. oh to note, they do have pretty powerful tasting mao shan wang gelato.in all I paid $20 for a pizza, a drink (nothing worth mentioning even though it was lemon grass) and a scoop of gelato.","1651":"I'm surprised this place rates so low. It's a popular lunch spot among my colleagues because of the buy one get one free lunch deal, and the fact that the food is pretty goodThey don't take reservations for lunch on weekdays, but it wasn't a problem for our party of 17. We made sure we arrived by 12pm to get a table. The menu that qualifies BOGO isn't large, but it's still decently diverse. You don't have to get the same item, just anything on the BOGO menu. A lot of people got the salmon with balsamic vinegar, and the Dory main dish was pretty popular too. I had the beef lasagna, which I thought was excellent. At half the price, it was a steal. The service was not outstandingly bad or good.Definitely a good place for a fancier lunch.","1652":"3 stars! 1 star each for FOOD, AMBIENCE and \"WILL I COME BACK?\". No stars for service and price.Also, I apologise in advance for the epic length review.The word 'hipster' is overused, really. This is a typical brunch restaurant. I don't see where it's 'hip' or 'ster'.Food is average. Mushroom soup is not Campbell's. Or at least to my un-hipster taste buds. Buffalo wings were like sweet and sour chicken wings, not spicy. Pasta was meh. The only thing I would come back for are the pizzas, Super thin crust and light. Nice.Ambience is homely. Lots of wood benches and tin pails for decoration. Seats are tightly packed and walk space is narrow. I might have seen a mason jar or two. \/shudder\"Will I come back?\" Yes, for the pizza and for the \"buy 1 get one free\" lunch special. Now the mechanics of this BOGO is dreadfully complicated and very sneaky if the customer is not careful. I will explain this in the next section. This would have been so easy to fix when asked, and would have won a life-long customer. But. hey, which restaurant manager would want to do that?Service is non-existent. Poor guys are overworked and do not have time for pleasantries. Price. Ahhh, the only thing this place has going for it is the 1 for 1 lunch special. When you get seated, you will see from the menu that not all items qualify for this. Items that do, have a little label next to it.So! Imagine the following scenario:Ah Beng and Ah Lian decide to try this new 'simi-lai eh hipster' cafe near Ah Mah's flat in Tiong Bahru.They order two muchroom soups ($11 for 2) This items is automatically 1 for 1. Don't know why they have to make life so confusing.Then Ah Beng orders a Vogole pasta MAIN for $18. Ah Lian orders a Funghi Pizza for $18.For appetisers, Ah Beng orders Buffalo Wings ($16) and Ah Lian orders Calamari Rings ($16).So, quick recap: 2 soups, 2 mains, 2 appetisers.QUESTION: How much was Ah Beng and Ah Lian charged for their lunch? (Assume no service charge.)ANSWER: You would think, this is easy! 1 for 1 mushroom soup + 1 for 1 MAIN + 1 for 1 appetiser = $11 + $18 + $16 = $45Wrong. Because Chapter 55 is so scared that customers will 'take advantage' of the 1 for 1 deal, this is how they calculated the bill:Mushroom soup is $11 for 2. (Written in the menu, don't argue.)Higher cost items are charged, lower cost items are free. (Written in the fine print, don't argue.)Actual bill is: $11 + $18 + $18 = $47Ah Beng and Ah Lian pays up and leaves, vowing to never come back and also something about mothers and fathers.Ok, ok, the story is a little dramatic for a difference of $2. But it is the principle of the whole thing. Even if it is not for principle, then it is about making a quick decision to make Ah Lian and Ah Beng happy customers. Long story short: After the trauma of mathematics and Chapter 55. Ah Beng and Ah Lian grew closer and lived happily ever after,","1653":"Had dinner here last night with family and friends. Our group of 6 had buffalo wings, pesto salad, truffle fries. Squid ink risotto, osso buco, mushroom pasta and anchovy pizza with Bonito flakes. We also had a few scoops of gelato for dessert. I got salted caramel, which was good but not the best I've ever had.All the dishes were good. The wings were juicy and spicy and the risotto was creamy, although a bit stingy with the shrimp and scallop (there was only 1 piece of each in the dish). Service was pretty fast and friendly.The place was almost full, which showed the terrible acoustics. There was a group of 8 seated about 3 meters away from our table and their loud chatter and laughter echoed. The table size is odd too--- definitely squeezy for 6, too roomy for 4. Overall it is a nice casual Italian place, and I would consider going back.","1654":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was very quiet and relaxing atmosphere. The lemon grass tea is fantastic and the beef risotto taste amazing. This is the first time I have good Italian in Asia!!","1655":"Chapter 55 is right in the heart of Tiong Bahru and, literally, just a short walk away from where I work. I ended up coming here with my husband for lunch and we were super stoked to utilize the 1-for-1 deal. It's unfortunate though, the pizza and the pasta we ordered were pretty bland... But the gelato was super rich and creamy and did make up for the mediocre lunch.","1656":"Continuing our Singapore saga of iconic food binging, we stopped by this small no frills restaurant in Chinatown. \u00c2\u00a0Feel free to leave your fancy dresses back in the Raffles or Fullerton since this is a casual dining experience. \u00c2\u00a0Most of the diners here were locals so it was a good sign. Their menu had a few more selections compared to most chicken rice joints, but we sticked with what made them famousLarge size boneless hainan chicken rice was very good indeed. The \"large\" size was equivalent to a reg size in the states, I hate to see what \u00c2\u00a0a \"small\" size plate is. Most of the chickens were deboned but prob 10-20% had some small bones still so westerners beware. The chicken was relatively tender, minimal fats, skin were thin & silky, indicating relatively fresh spring chicken. \u00c2\u00a0Most cuts they served were good meats, other placed might try to sneak in too many undesirable parts into your plate, not here. \u00c2\u00a0Two self-serving dipping sauce available: the ginger sauce & the spicy sauce. \u00c2\u00a0There was also a bottle of sweet thick dark soy sauce that was good. \u00c2\u00a0Personally I still prefer the Cantonese style of dipping sauce for chicken: its generally more fresh, has more ginger & scallion, slightly more salty & sesame oil. The rice here was excellent: juicy, aromatic & had great flavor derived from the chicken itself, a great compliment to the chicken.Overall this place serves very good local style Hainan chicken rice, it might be a semi-tourist trap but it was able to maintain high standards at locals' price. Would def be back next trip.","1657":"Delicious chicken & rice meals! We tried the roasted chicken & rice and the lemon chicken & rice. \u00c2\u00a0We both got the Medium serving, but should have gotten the large. \u00c2\u00a0Good amounts but we were starving. \u00c2\u00a0Service was super fast and the staff was friendly. \u00c2\u00a0Room was very clean & not too busy when we went in the middle of the afternoon on a Monday. \u00c2\u00a0Would go back, would recommend!","1658":"Half a Hainanese boneless chicken for 12 SGD, delicious food with great value. Sweet lemonade drink is refreshing. They have a sanitation grade of B but I'm ok with that.","1659":"Great chicken and rice. Got the lemon chicken. Nice and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Goo simple fare.","1660":"Wandering around Chinatown, looking for food randomly.As a tourist we never heard of Tiong Bahru, but the huge sign screaming at us \"$2.50 for Hainanese Chicken Rice!\" $2.50?! Why not?!With low expectations, we definitely pleasantly surprise. We ended up having Hainanese Chicken Rice ($2.50) - of course!Raw Fish Congee ($3.00)For that price, just too much food... The chicken is quite decent and the chili sauce has a great kick! The congee though is a little different than the one I used to. A lot thicker like porridge. Full of condiments: fried dough, ginger, shallot, green onion...I am full just looking at my friend eating... The deco is basic but is clean and the service really fast and efficient!Great if you want something simple to eat when you roaming Chinatown!","1661":"We stopped here to try the famous chicken rice. Super cheap and delicious. Omg. We split a plate after doing some shopping further down the street. I wish I could replicate this dish at home. Service was quick and even though no one spoke English the menu complete with photos was very helpful :)","1662":"My favorite chicken rice joint thus far. Rice is fragrant and one is never given the bony parts. Haven't had any of their other offers, as the chicken rice is always a go-to. Service is quick and efficient, and I certainly appreciate table service, a well welcomed deviation from the typical hawker centre fare.","1663":"I think we are often faced with a chicken rice OD effect living in SG since we get a plate of that dish at every turn we go. I hardly have chicken rice because I am just so sick of the dish. But when I do have cravings for it, all I \u00c2\u00a0want is a plate of boneless, skinless breast meat atop garlic rice. None of the fancy schmany collagen below skin sort of thing, those don't work for me.If you are a similar chicken rice eater, you will like this branch of the Tiong Bahru Chicken Rice. The breast meat was tender and flavourful, not dry like you will get with breast meat at some places. The rice had a good bite. Very familiar taste. Just what I needed for my SG-styled chicken rice. Did I mention too? Their chilli sauce has got a good kick to it! Enjoy it with the dish well!","1664":"This place is so unassuming. It is on the first floor of a just plaza around the corner from the busy food stalls. We walked by it almost daily and didn't even consider it when going to eat. Boy were we surprised. Definitely a hidden gem. First of all, amazing service. We found out we can swap out dishes we don't eat if we wanted to. I did the middle course kiseki meal. So beautiful. If you can't go to Japan and experience that, come here and experience it. You eat with your eyes and mouth. Beautifully arranged delicious food. I was so full but so happy. Dont waste time and belly space on alcohol. Just enjoy the amazing food.","1665":"Went there for the wife's birthday and wanted to try the omakase, but did not take it due to a rush of time for the wife': assignment. Ended up ordering two sets: sushi soba gozen and mini gozen.The truffle sauce chawanmushi was pretty unique in taste, the well balanced umami taste was a delight. Even though the lack of ingredients like mushroom and fish cake were absent, the truffle sauce made up for it.!","1666":"What amazes me about Hakumai is how low profile it has remained. The place is packed, and all my foodie friends (amateurs, not pros) know about it. But then I meet professional food reviewers who have never heard of it. And virtually no expat has it on their sushi list. The low down is that this is excellent quality, with the same Tsukiji-flown fish used by all the other high end sushi places (Tuesdays and Fridays, by the way - book accordingly), at a quarter of the price. Gary-san not only has plenty of experience at the more famous names where he has learnt his craft (I discovered him at Hinoki), he is continuously seeking to improve in true shokunin style, and often adds a little bit of tasteful innovation such as his famous goose foie gras-ebi that tops the sashimi selection if you're going for the omakase. Apparently, he has gotten flak from Japanese customers due to his deviations from the classical way, but the Japanese people I have taken there love it... set your expectations accordingly?It's a low key shop in International Plaza, right at the back. Looks like any number of Japanese themed restaurant from the outside. Inside, a minimalist counter with perhaps 8 seats, and a few tables. Gary-san is part of the show, so the counter is a must, so you can enjoy seeing him slice urchins with giant knives or happily spread the wings of a flying fish under your nose. I think you need to go for the $150 omakase to get the full experience - the cooked food is also interesting. The service is spectacular and if I had to show someone what \"exceptional service\" means, I'd take him to Hakumai.I go there too often, despite the increasing difficulty in getting a counter seat at short notice due to his ever increasing popularity. The omakase keeps changing with the seasonality of the produce... One side effect has been that my Tokyo trips have featured considerably less sushi, as I just can't be bothered to deal with the effort that even half decent sushi chefs force upon the unsuspecting gaijin who just wants to have dinner at their place these days. Gary-san is easier, and just as good, if not occasionally better...One last thing: do chat with Gary-san about your expectations and tastes. He is just as capable of going full experimental and seasonal on you (think deep fried baby crabs served whole, mini squids almost still squirming...) but if the idea of chewing through 8 perfectly crispy legs in one bite disgusts you, ask for something more normal.Hakumai is my default port of call when guests are visiting Singapore and want to eat somewhere nice. It's the kind of place that \"you can't find anywhere else\".","1667":"I have known Chef Gary, the owner of Hakumai since his Hinoki days. I'm glad he's got a place of his own now. I like his omakase as he can cater to personal perferences. Additionally, he has got a lot of bento sets which are affordable and of above average quality and quantity. Service is average - depending on whom you get, you can get a smiley girl or a stern looking auntie. \u00c2\u00a0The Hakumai Bento is a mega set full of different types of dishes, best suited for the undecided. The Ishikari nabe was comforting and there was plenty of fish meat. \u00c2\u00a0The truffle chawanmushi was gimmicky. There was nothing wrong with the chawanmushi, but the truffle sauce was nothing to die for. \u00c2\u00a0On a public holiday, the whole Tanjong Pagar area was dead, but there was at least 3-4 groups of diners. I was pleasantly surprised!","1668":"After changing my job, I seldom get to hang out in the Mountbatten area thus when I had the chance to visit Jalan Batu Food Centre, I jumped at the chance to have my favourite hainanese chap chye bng (economic rice). Popular items are always one of the chops (chicken or pork, both are equally awesome), the sam zum ba (directly translated as three-layer pork) - braised to perfection, the pork belly is a MUST-Try.For those who enjoy curry, they also have curry chicken and other accompanying vegetables and omelette to choose from.Dont take my word for it but from the way the queue forms during lunch time and the faces of the people queuing with an expectation to be satisfied with good food can guarantee you a good meal at an affordable price. For 2 meats and 1 veg, the price was about $3.50. I'm totally salivating just thinking about it. Gawd!","1669":"This economic rice or cai fan stall in Jalan Batu Food Centre attracts the longest lunch queue, and for good reason at that. It's good and its cheap - $2.50 for a plate of yummy pork chop, taupok and egg omelette... where do you get food for less than $3 nowadays! The stall owners are amiable but they tend to give you less rice when they see you're a girl (and a good thing for me too, I tend not to finish rice when they pile it on!). Still, good, quick and cheap are qualities I approve when it comes to hawker food!","1670":"China Whampoa Homemade Noodles located at Blk 91 Whampoa Drive Market & Food Centre specialises in homemade (handmade) noodles. This stall is well known as it has been featured on several TV programmes related to food. I visited China Whampoa Homemade Noodles on a Saturday morning. I was surprised that there was no queue at this stall. The reason was because they customers were told to find a table nearby and come back at a certain time (e.g. half an hour later) to collect their bowl of noodles. They serve a variety of noodles such as Ban Mee and You Mian. In addition, these were available with prawns, abalone clams, sliced fish, pig's kidney or even with abalone! I ordered a bowl of Abalone Clams Hand Made You Mian $4 and had to wait for slightly less than half an hour before I could collect my order. The Abalone Clams Hand Made You Mian was delicious! It consisted of abalone clams, vegetable, minced meat and ikan bilis. The homemade noodles (you mian) was springy, soft and flavourful! It tasted slightly different from the other homemade noodles stall and seems to be accompanied by a hint of sweetness. The soup was refreshing. It was robust, sweet and not salty. One unique ingredient which was used was the mani cai \u00e9\u00a9\u00ac\u00e5\u00b0\u00bc\u00e8\u008f\u009c(aka sweet leaf). This was an essential ingredient as it provides a natural sweetness to the soup. The homemade chilli paste was slightly sweet with a extremely spicy after taste. Despite the spiciness, it was just so shiok (addictive) that I continually dipped the minced meat into it or just add some to each spoonful of noodles. By the end of this meal, I nearly finished all the chilli paste and found myself with swollen lips (just like Angelina Jolie's \u00c2\u00a0bee stung lips - sexy) haha.. \u00c2\u00a0You have been warned! Detailed review: foodiefc.blogspot.sg\/201\u00e2\u0080\u00a6","1671":"Solid fish based soup with 3 prawns, pork meatballs (I think), vermicelli noodles, some veggies, dried anchovies. Ingredients looked and tasted fresh. Their home made chili sauce on the side is the bomb. They're near the bottom right corner near Kim Keat lane.","1672":"Ok, this review is for this hawker center, not this particular one. Food here is authentic, old world Sg and prices are good. H.mee fkt, mee rebus, porridge, chicken rice, duck, pork belly. My fav area to eat in sg.","1673":"Stayed at V Hotel across the street and decided to stop by for breakfast. It was the only restaurant nearby that had a line out the door so I decided to give it a try. You queue up and order your food first. They'll make you your drinks right a way and give you a buzzer to let you know when you're good is ready. My group of 3 ordered 3 of the specials and we enjoyed them all. All the food seemed high quality. The laksa was really good with a tasty broth. It gets pretty busy around 7-8am, but the line dies around 9am. Seating wasn't too bad, not much of a wait. Toast box is a must try when you're in Singapore.","1674":"Stayed at V Hotel across the street and decided to stop by for breakfast.

Their most popular dish is their Teriyaki chicken set. It comes with miso soup, chawanmushi and a piece of watermelon. Their Teriyaki chicken together with their teriyaki sauce is able to match with restaurant standard.Not forgetting to mention their chawanmushi, really soft and melt in your mouth.For all those, you are only paying a price of $4.80. Definitely a great place to taste nice Japanese food at a low range of price.","1676":"Cheap and good Japanese food at the Golden Mile hawker centers. This stall won a makan sutra award in 2013.Prices are very reasonable. The chicken teriyaki set is at $5 while the pork katsu set at $5.50. The teriyaki chicken set comes with cawanmushi (Japan steam egg). Both comes with a small miso soup. Huge amount of cabbage with salad cream covers the rest of the plate.Service was fast with 2 uncles , one taking the orders and the other doing the cooking. The stall is also very clean.","1677":"Probably the most \"wholesome\" place at Orchard Towers\/ 4 Floors! I came here with 4 friends randomly because we heard the live music immediately when we walked into Orchard Towers. The \"Pub\" itself is not very large but it is packed with about 15-20 Filipino girls in matching outfits and a Filipino cover band playing American music that sounds almost better than the bands they are covering. As soon as you find a seat hostesses will sit with you and help you order but, they don't take the orders. Basically their job is to hang with the customers, convince you to buy them drinks, buy yourself more drinks and they also do choreographed dances during the bands break. They aren't prostitutes like most of the other businesses in the building but don't think they are in love with you either. I thoroughly enjoyed this place spending way too much money but, having a lot of fun singing to popular songs and hanging with hot girls. We even came here twice in 2 days! I probably advise this place more than any other place in Orchard Towers unless you are looking for another level of trouble.","1678":"Tonight we enjoyed a dinner set for 4 people, consisting of soup, steamed chicken, sweet and sour pork, egg with tomato, fried rice, and saut\u00c3\u00a9ed vegetables. All delicious and complimented one another. At SGD99 it can be considered fair price. Happy to pay.","1679":"They have hardly changed the menu over the last 20 years. It is simple, healthy, homey food but so delicious and addictive. In addition to the soups, we always order the same dishes when we come here: samsui ginger chicken, hometown tofu, Shan fu leaves, olive rice. Even the waiters are homey and friendly - the culture of this place is strong indeed. Reasonable prices too.","1680":"This is pure comfort food.The best order dishes for me are:- samsui chicken- ah kong fan shu ye (spicy sweet potato leaves)- tofu in claypot- soup (optional)The samsui chicken is always so tender, and when wrapped in the lettuce with ginger, it is so crisp and refreshing.The spicy sweet potato leaves and tofu just go very well with rice. Perfect to share the dishes.There are also individual portions - but there are only 3 options for the rice with chicken dish. I will say don't bother with those and grab your friends to dine with you or just order the samsui chicken and pack the leftover in a doggy bag.","1681":"Pretty awesome Chinese food! \u00c2\u00a0I cannot remember everything we got but I truly enjoyed the Samsui Ginger Chicken! I liked that the restaurant was very spacious and that it was located in a mall. \u00c2\u00a0I really recommend this place for group gatherings. \u00c2\u00a0There are plenty of dessert options for afterwards too, like Blackball :P","1682":"Delicious chicken with ginger sauce--great for sharing with a group. Simple, but fresh and moist. The restaurant also sells jars of their ginger sauce by the cashier. The salmon tastes wonderful, too--flavorful and a nice texture. Excellent, attentive service. A wonderful first Cantonese food experience!","1683":"Highly recommend their SAMSUI GINGER CHICKEN. This is their signature dish and when you try it, you understand why!!! The accompanying ginger sauce is so delicious. We actually ended up purchasing two jars to take home. Other dishes I really enjoyed were their hometown tofu, steamed egg salmon, minced pork, and peanut appetizer.","1684":"This place is amazing! Who knew you could make authentic Chinese food without making it taste like it's filled with sodium and make it taste amazing! Highly recommend when you go to Singapore!","1685":"Was here for lunch the other day and totally enjoyed the Chinese food served by this restaurant. Especially liked the tender sauce chicken, the spicy sweet potato leaves and the claypot tofu. My only gripe is that the portions can be larger.","1686":"Above average d\u00c3\u00a9cor and nice view out to the water for a mall restaurant. Steam chicken and herb broth soup was very good. A little disappointed that they charged for tea, hot towels, and the dish of peanut. Our meal also came with a free jar of sambal sauce to take home!","1687":"Among the dishes we ordered...Liked: Samsui Ginger Chicken, Claypot TofuNeutral\/Slightly Positive: Steamed San Yu, Steamed Hand-Chopped Minced Pork with Salted FishCould be better: Kangkong with Fermented Beancurd (a bit too salty)Love the peanuts they give as appetizers! Portions are small but good if you want to try multiple dishes. Service could be improved. Once the restaurant got busy, the attention we got dropped significantly. The soy sauce on our table was also out but the refill we had asked for never came...","1688":"If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive dinner in the Paragon Shopping Mall, Soup Restaurant is for you. With various set dinners that are good for groups, nobody will leave hungry. I would recommend getting the Samsui Chicken which comes with a really good ginger sauce. Also, the soups aren't half bad. Protip: The peanuts they serve at the start cost an arm and leg, send it back and save some $$$.","1689":"This place was a pleasant surprise. A lot of restaurants on Orchard are expensive and mediocre; this place is neither. On my recent visit I had the Samsui Chicken, Venison with ginger and spring onions, fried rice, green beans, and the fried mee. The ginger sauce that comes with the chicken is bomb, possibly highlight of the meal. The venison was also great; it's super tender. The only thing that didn't do it for me was the mee; I'll passs next time. I'll definitely come back especially considering it was very affordable at well under $20 a person.","1690":"Food: \u00c2\u00a0Nice food quality in comparison to other places. Prices are okay. Portions for some things are smaller than expected, also some slices of fish are a little thick.Service: \u00c2\u00a0quite good and accommodating Bottom line: \u00c2\u00a0I would eat here again probably. Location: Nice views of the bay and ArtScience Museum. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant is located inside the Marina Bag Shoppes by the museum.","1691":"LOVE this restaurant. My family and I visited Sen of Japan recently and were blown away by the level of service and the delicious food they had to offer! They were very accommodating for our larger group. The meal was delightful in every way and the view was captivating at the base of Marina Bay Sands. We will be back!","1692":"Fusion Japanese food in Singapore! I was looking for something like Nobu Matsuhisa here and I found it. It's still not as good as the one in LA but it will do to satisfy my New Style Sashimi craving with their Special Carpaccio (I recommend white fish) and yellow tail with jalape\u00c3\u00b1o. They've got a variety of rolls also, and obviously portions are not as big as in the states so be mindful of that. I would come back to satisfy my cravings. 3.5 stars is about right but rounding up to 4","1693":"The sushi was fresh and delicious. \u00c2\u00a0The miso black cod was perfectly prepared. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately our experience was marred by soggy chicken karagge - deep fried breaded marinated chicken. \u00c2\u00a0It arrived soggy and tasted as if it had been fried in rancid oil. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps it was reheated. \u00c2\u00a0(We had excellent chicken karagge at Ginzu Lion in Suntec City a few days later.) In addition the salad dressing on the salad at Sen tasted as if it had turned. \u00c2\u00a0So while the higher profile dishes on the menu were fresh and prepared well, more standard fare was poor. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps the way to avoid disappointment is to only order more expensive dishes as that is what the kitchen pays attention to. \u00c2\u00a0 Service was excellent. Unlimited refills on the ice green tea was a nice touch.","1694":"service was friendly but disappointing--due to a lack of knowledge regarding the sake & food menus. the sake selection offered various bottle-sizes (300ml, 500ml, 750ml) and offering sake by the glass, which is a pleasant surprise to individual drinkers or those who don't feel the impulse to consume an entire bottle. the sashimi 16-pc. sampler wasn't too fresh, with recently-thawed tuna and toro that had been lightly seared around the edges.would order again: truffle edamame (how can you really go wrong with that) and truffle ankake (who am i kidding, i love truffles).","1695":"Probably reluctant to share this place and that's why did not publish this review for a long time. But after Class 95FM had most voters vote for this place as the best meepok place in singapore, the secret is out of the bag!On my first experience, I was surprised to know that the chef and owner of the stall is a Japanese who settled down in Singapore. There are many plus points to it. Other than having Japanese ramen style meepok with shoyu and char su (char siew jap style), you get their relentless precision and hardwork. When they set up a mee pok stall, they mean serious business. The noodles are real al' dente and I usually order extra serving just to slurp more on its own! $0.50 only. The signature dish costs only $5 and it's all you ever want in a bak chor mee. Though it's out in the wild west, do make a detour here even if you are in Clementi or Bukit Timah. This place is the real deal!","1696":"Seeing a Japanese family selling traditional hawker fare instead of Ramen is definitely a novelty. The $4 Bak Chor Mee has quite a generous serving of braised mushrooms, mixed tender sliced and minced pork, 3 bouncy pork balls and 2 slices of chewy canned 'abalone'. The texture of the noodle is cooked al dente and well-coated with a good balance of sweetness, tanginess and spiciness. The noodle is laced with crispy and fragrant pork lard (I don't eat pork lard and thought they were ikan billis initially) and a bowl of cloudy looking soup to complement (Pork broth with a tinge of abalone).","1697":"Ordered: 1.30pmFood in hand: 2.11pmNot sure why it takes so long given the pace she works at (which is incredible by the way).Special noodles with abalone and prawns ($5) - 3 starsThe noodles tasted great - 4.5 stars - only for the first five minutes. They quickly lost their \"crunchy\" springy texture as I ate and thereafter tasted lackluster. The abalone was deliciously sweet, but the prawns were just okay. Not quite worth the wait unfortunately.Order here to pick up in advance or for delivery if you really have to try it. Worth paying 50 cents ($5.50 instead of $5) or $2 more ($12 instead of $2) to avoid the wait.Ambience - 2 starsRuined by the stray cat that kept brushing against our legs as we ate, while the girls next door kept taunting it! Ugh.japanesemeepok.getz.co\/H\u00e2\u0080\u00a6","1698":"I've eaten the #1 Deluxe Mee Pok here twice, once from takeout brought home by my brother, once in person. It's a wetter bak chor mee, doused in a flavorful broth. Both times I admit the overall flavor profile is better than most bak chor mee I've had, probably enhanced by the addition of the abalone and prawn juice broth at the bottom of the noodles. Unfortunately that also makes the noodles soggy quickly which negates the initially al dente crunchy texture :( The meatballs are tasty but the meat slices and prawns were underwhelming. I don't think it's worth the wait, order online and do pickup, it's only 50 cents more for a 40 minute saving in time. They do delivery too but I'm unsure of the delivery radius. -- This was even though there seemed like only 4 parties ahead of us? On weekends they do a japanese fusion mee pok, and they also serve large prawn noodles ($10).Protip: Get the $5 version for more ingredients, and add 50 cents for extra noodles!","1699":"This is the newer stall at 713, the original is at 710.This stall is usually operated by either the mom or the son. They have additional help to take orders. The Q here is not that long compared to 710.The taste is similar, but today the mee pok noodles is slightly undercooked. I had additional chilli which is always great.","1700":"One hour Q !!! We joined the Q at 12.48pm, and got our noodles at 1.49pm. Yes. It sounds silly. But it's the weekend, and there's a thunderstorm, nowhere else to rush to.TasteVery tender noodles, and tender chewy pork slices, mushrooms soaked in sauce, meat balls minced pork and abalone mushrooms? There is definitely a good balance in terms of ingredients and noodles and taste. The vingear is a bit weak even though I asked for added vinegar. The surprise is the chilli which is fabulous. I already asked for more chilli, and it felt just right, the spiciness, tartness, and sweet.The soup has a very beany fragrance to it, unlike those porkiness and msg soups. So this can be considered a pleasant surprise too.If you hate Q-ing, choose your time to come here.","1701":"Somehow I came here after the big hype online where most people would write great reviews about how a Japanese came to Singapore to pick up the skill and set up shop to sell mee pok, just like how any other Singaporean would.Unfortunately I didn't wake up early enough to reach here at 0700hrs, but got here at around 0940hrs instead and there was a long queue. While starting at the back, it seemed that there was a large order to go, which I understand, family breakfast, gathering, it's fine. When I finally got to move a step, it was 30 minutes later. Ok my expectation was growing as I got hungrier. Another 30 minutes passed and my order was taken in advance. I ordered the special noodle no.1 and added noodles for 50 cents more. Ok, another 20 minutes wait and I got my food.The noodle portion was generous, a pretty hearty amount. It came with a prawn, 3 pieces of abalone, and minced meat, all glaced with lard. One of the main characteristic of the noodles is that it has a lot of lard (crispy not soft) which is good I guess, to prevent the noodles from sticking together. However, I reckon the crowd caused Naoji san to undercook the noodles and it was slightly hard still. I must say that the overall taste was very balanced, a tinge of vinegar, soy sauce, except for the lard part, very overwhelming. So somehow it was not overly tasty, but the chilli sauce helped a fair bit.I also ordered a bowl of teochew dumpling soup, there was a lot of lard in the soup as well. Again, I had the same observation, the dumplings were not cooked enough, the skin of the dumpling was slightly undercooked with the pork filling.Would have preferred to give a 3.5 stars but I guess it's not available yet. Given the hype, I will go to the original Ah Hoe mee pok, lesser queue and more flavorful mee pok.","1702":"One of the best mee pok I have ever eaten. The texture of the mee pok is thick in a tasty way. The noodles are springy. The lard is sinful but really enhances the taste. The first mouth felt a bit salty but afterwards it is fine and I did not feel thirsty. The staff is thoughtful to terminate the queue when the food is finishing. The queue for lunch time stopped around 11:40am! That's how popular this place is. Another valuable asset is the great attitude of the staff who readily customizes orders!","1703":"Japanese Pride and Precision..... In a local dish. It's official... As much as I loved our Michelin starred Teochew Mince Pork noodle, I have officially found my current favorite Bak Chor Mee (Minced Pork Noodles). I won't go into the backstory of how the stall was first open by her father etc as googling Ah Hoe Mee Pok will prompt multiple sites sharing their family's story.  Instead, I'll dive straight into the dishes we tried. Special Mee Pok - Soup or Dry ($4 \/ $5)Let's start with the \"basic\" or one of the starter Mee Poks. Ordered the non-chilli version as the wife is not much a Chilli eater. I really hate to say this but.... Based on the non-chilli version, the Mee Pok here is a lot better than our Michelin Star version. The noodles used for both the Mee Pok and Mee Kia were of very good quality, retaining its springiness and chewiness. It absorbed the flavors of their sauce very well and didn't have that floury starchy taste that is commonly found in other Mee Pok dishes. For $5, there is a generous amount of ingredients , with 2 prawns, 3 slices of abalone (mock? Or lower grade abalones), 2 meat balls and a lot of minced pork. The sauce used was really delicious. It was fragrant, salty, a little sweet and rich, thanks to the oil from the fried lard but it wasn't overly oily, allowing the sauce to coat the Mee Pok beautifully without leaving that thick oily feeling on the roof of your mouth. Japanese Fusion - miso \/ shoyu - soup or dry ($6 \/ $7) We had to try what made this place famous. The Japanese fusion noodles. I went with $6 for the shoyu and $7 for the miso. Both served dry. What made both these dishes so great was the sauce and the way it coated the noodles. This wasn't just some mad experiment to add ingredients into a minced meat noodles. With the first bite, you can taste the effort and the though process of putting everything together. The sauces both coated to noodles beautifully, ensuring that you get the fusion flavors popping in your mouth with every bite, without overpowering your taste buds. It almost reminds you of a good Tsukemen Ramen where instead of a broth, you get a thick, rich, dipping sauce for your noodles. The Miso version offered a very earthy flavor. Very umami with the natural sweetness of the miso coming through delicately. It was very wholesome yet light enough to ensure that you don't get tired of the flavors after the first 2-3 bites. The Shoyu version was surprisingly the bolder version. Unlike our regular soya sauce, Shoyu is made with fermenting more wheat than soya beans. It's less salty but richer and more wholesome and this made a world of difference to the dish. It was fragrant, full of flavor and there was a hint of either Nori or Bonito that had been infused with the shoyu, giving it a sweet, fragrant, slightly more umami flavor that you normally get with regular Chinese soya sauce. And like the \"regular\" Mee Pok, they are very generous with the ingredients. For $7, which may seem steep for a bowl of minced pork noodles, you get 2 slices of abalone, 4 meat balls, lots of minced pork, lean pork slices and 2 large pieces of Japanese chashu, which almost melts in your mouth with each bite. What I really like across the board is the care that was put into each ingredient. Unlike most minced pork noodles, the lean and minced pork were perfectly cooked, tender and almost bouncy with the minced pork having a food fat to meat ratio, ensuring that it doesn't go dry while cooking. Even when preparing each dish, the cook doesn't just boil everything and dump it into the bowl. Each ingredient is \"plated\" carefully, showing off the typical Japanese pride when it comes to cooking. Teochew Dumpling soup While the dumplings (wantons) were pretty normal and the soup (to me) a little on the salty side, they were again very generous with their ingredients. No plain soup with dumplings here. The soup was nice and chalky from the cooking of the pork and there was minced pork and lots of cabbage in the soup. A great way to balance and otherwise very meaty lunch. Overall, I really enjoyed the noodles here. For the traditionalist, it may be a step too far away from an authentic bowl of teochew minced meat noodles but from a consumer \/ foodie stand point, it certainly was special and offered something so familiar yet so different, showing that sometimes, maybe drifting slightly away from tradition may just help take what is deemed as common hawker food, to the next level. After all, with Japanese \/ Asian influences making its appearance is michelin star restaurants across the globe, it's only a matter of time that our local hawker favorites receive the same treatment. There is certainly no confusion in this Japanese Chinese Fusion. Remarks: Do take note that because he doesn't dump all the ingredients in to cook at once and because each bowl is cooked individually and with care, waiting time may take longer jan the average Mee Pok seller.","1704":"One of the best bak chor mee I have tried.Meticulously done by a Japanese cook who takes pride in his preparation. Be prepared to wait if you are going during peak hours. The stall opens from about 6.30 am. The crowd starts coming in at about 9.30 am.","1705":"One of the best mee pok I've tasted. Located in a nondescript coffee shop, run by Japanese expat family, captures the local taste and flavor of a classic Singaporean noodle dish! Try it dry with their homemade chili sauce.","1706":"This places comes with a lot of hype. Japanese-Singapore fusion. It is fine, but it didn't blow me out of the water. It was just a decent bowl of mee pok with a twist. Complaints? None. Did it excite me? Not really either.","1707":"One of the many great cafes at millennia walk-love how quiet it is (off lunch hours). You can always count on them for a good cup of Joe and recommendations on beans!There are also power plugs at the side with high tables to ensure that your devices are fully charged for meetings and work! Staff are friendly and approachable, don't be afraid to ask for recommendations! :)","1708":"It's been awhile, Yelp, it's been awhile. Let me start this review by saying I am not a coffee drinker. I grew up grinding coffee beans for my mum and brewing them in a french press and somehow the overdose of aromas, maybe the bitter overtones, turned me off coffee. I am also highly sensitive to caffeine and sugar since I drink water and eat fresh food where possible. \u00c2\u00a0Oh and of course that time I had a latte at a Starbucks in a central Singapore location and it gave me the worst stomach ache a few hours later (they apologized, said it was the milk and offered vouchers - which was sweet, but I wasn't about to get myself sick again). All this to say that when I DO choose to drink a coffee, it has to look really inviting and pleasurable. Jewel Coffee does just that. I enjoy wine and analyzing it so this is the best I can piece apart the coffee at Jewel. The red velvet latte is made of brewed coffee from one country, steamed milk and then some red velvet powder. There isn't any sugar added so you can do what you please at the condiment station. In wine, a single grape variety can deliver a good profile of flavors without the haphazardness of a blend of grapes. I'm not partial to both but it's interesting to taste each variety on it's own. It seems the same way with coffee beans - I picked beans with some coffee tones and a mild \"rust\" to it, and it was a great base for the red velvet powder. Having tried the red velvet latte a few times now, opt for the full fat milk and not the skimmed. It makes a huge difference to the acidity of the drink. I really enjoyed the latte and as mentioned, I've had a few times since. I can only drink about half a cup before the caffeine kicks get too much, but my partner gladly finishes the other half (no pun intended). Jewel also carries some interesting pastries. There's a salted caramel something and a gula melaka croissant...both of which were quite good. Though I wish they were fresh and warm without asking. There are some quirky bags for sale as well in the merchandise section that perhaps one day, when I'm high enough on coffee, I will actually buy.The last perk about Jewel is that this outlet has great seating space that allows you to talk business without being overheard (some of the other options in the mall have very packed seating). I would request that they put in some arm chairs or more comfortable chairs though. There is also another Jewel Coffee outlet that I shall not name that is fantastic on the weekends for chilling in and watching the world go by. Residents who live nearby are already clued in and I'm not about to give the lobang away, but it has lots of sunlight streaming in, couches\/tables\/work counters and as mentioned above, the food and beverages aren't bad at all. In other words, I think I have found a coffee chain to my liking. Yours truly, a non-coffee drinker.","1709":"My friend & I came this restaurant just because it was open later than most restaurants in the area also the Spanish menu looked interesting. The vibe is quite nice and upbeat. The staff is very attentive and helpful as well. What impressed me was I actually had a problem with the order (not the waitress's fault). I asked to speak to the manager. He came to my table inquiring what the problem was. He (Mr. Lucas) was VERY UNDERSTANDING and went above & beyond what was necessary to rectify the situation. You can judge the quality of the restaurant & staff by the leadership of the management. The food was REALLY good!","1710":"Just right next to the Guoco tower and right outside Tanjong Pagar mrt.I never would've expected this restaurant to deliver such food rich in flavour. As my friend and I entered we saw the waitress serving to what it looked like bruschetta . We immediately asked what she was serving we forgot the name but it was a chorizo flatbread bruschetta. .CHORIZO FLATBREAD BRUSCHETTA.The bite sizes bruschetta was a tasteful shortbread rubbed with tomato and topped with a chorizo sauccision(in other words it was a a chorizo dried sausage)and was just delightful. I loved how the tomato came as a surprise as it isnt as visible as when I tasted it on my pallate. Paired with red wine and this appetizer was just perfect! Note that this isn't on the menu so you may want to ask the waiter because this is definitely not something you'd wanna miss!.CHARCOAL SEAFOOD PAELLA.Next was the Charcoal seafood paella, i just loved how it spoke to all my senses. It looked super delicious and smelled amazing. Honestly, i know it isnt proper table etiquette but I took the time to get one spoon serving and smelled it for atleast a minute before I had a taste! I loved it! Just 1 bit about that paella was that it had peas and I love the idea about using natural flavours but the peas didn't do it for me.PORK BELLY WITH CHOPPED VEGETABLES WITH APPLE TARTAR SAUCE.Lastly, was pork belly with chopped vegetables and an apple tartar sauce. That sauce alone was tangy and I wasnt sure how'd it go with the pork belly but when i took a little bit of everything and put it together it was magical! It may be a tad bit salty for some but that totally depends on your taste ... and don't forget that red wine haha! I'll be visiting again really soon.","1711":"If you can't go all the way to Katong, but really want to have nice laksa, this can be an option. Located not far from Newton MRT, this place is really just a stall outside a mall, but they serve good laksa as it is in Katong. A lot of people say that the location isn't good because it's outside and not air-conditioned but we're tired of aircon and that Singapore is hot anyway so why not eating hot coconut rich soup and be sweaty (and merry)?All in all, it's worth visiting for a short cut if you don't want to go all the way to Katong","1712":"I had read the Straits Times's article last Sunday, on a showdown of the good old cheeseburger from 12 burger-centric restaurants in Singapore, by a panel of 4 judges: The Sunday Times' senior food correspondent Wong Ah Yoke; Violet Oon Singapore's director of operations Tay Yiming; Artichoke restaurant's chef-owner Bjorn Shen; and The Sunday Times' food editor Tan Hsueh Yun. And BurgerLabo emerged as the clear winner out of the 12 restaurants that were put to the test, which were Hans Im Gl\u00c3\u00bcck, Omakase Burger, Shake Shack, Wolf Burger, McDonald's, Carl's Junior, Fat Burger, Black Tap at MBS, Burger Joint in Amoy Street, Burger+, and Fat Papas in Bali Lane. Needless to say, I was soooo tempted and intrigued to try it after reading that article. LolSo here I came today, to try the best burgers out of all the famous burgers in Singapore. A little disclaimer though, I'm not those that try every single burger that open up in town. I'm not that into burgers, since I'm health conscious... lol. I know I know, health conscious yet still greedy and all about food, how contradictary. But seriously, what got me intrigued here though, is that BurgerLabo uses a 170g beef patty for their Basic Burger ($23), that is made from a blend of grass-fed Black Angus beef neck, Aomori Gyu ribeye, Toriyama Umami Wagyu A4 tenderloin, and Sendai Wagyu A5 brisket, to get that 'perfect' balance of flavors. The patty is further topped with grilled organic tomato, locally-farmed Green Wave lettuce, 2 slices of American cheese, house-made bone marrow 'butter' and sauce. The bone-marrow butter is used to toast the bread and grill the meat patty. On the special sauce, Mr Tan Ken Loon, owner of the 3 month old BurgerLabo, said: \"I love to eat bone-marrow and I wanted to incorporate it into the burger patty. However, the oils will come out and the patty will start to shrink. So instead, I extracted the bone marrow, warmed it into a liquid state and, after it is chilled, it looks like a milky white blob of butter. We don't use oil, we use this.\"This is the 12th version of Mr Tan's Basic Burger, from when he started on his burger journey in December 2015. BurgerLabo is the sister restaurant to The Naked Finn, which is also owned by Mr Tan. To this much precision and care taken to engineer a perfect beef patty, with the meticulous effort of using organic ingredients and grass-fed beef for the patty to appeal to the ever growing health conscious crowd like me, I'm totally sold and determined to come here to try the burger. So after the long ass background story, so yeah, the burger was AWESOMELY delicious!!! I cannot describe it all in words really, how delicious and melt in your mouth the whole burger was, you really have to just go try it for the experience. Perfectly well balanced and juicy, the patty's charred surface gave it a smoky flavor, without the patty being overcooked, due to it being cooked a la plancha. Cooking the meat on a plancha sears the meat better than any other cooking surface can. It creates a browned, slightly crispy exterior while sealing in all the juices. For those Ramly burger lovers, you can add a fried organic free-range egg with a runny orange yolk to the burger, for an extra $3. The Basic Burger with a single 170g patty is $23, a double patty of 150g each (if I'm not wrong) will costs you $36. Adding an egg to the double patty, the burger will set you back a whopping $39. I was expecting throngs of people rushing to go try this burger out after the article got published in our national papers, but surprisingly I could easily get a table without making a reservation. I guess the location is a little inaccessible if you don't drive and probably not everyone is willing to part with $39 for a burger, since a burger is afterall just a burger. Albeit it was a very well made one. If cost is a factor, just go for the Basic Burger, that is already a very delicious burger imo. But if you have decided to travel all the way JUST for this burger, and you don't live in Singapore, I'll say, go for the double patty with an egg thrown in to get the full experience of that goodness. Hahaa... I've ordered the mid-joint wings, it was good too, nicely marinated but it was kinda tiny and not worth the $12 for that 5 tiny pieces. I have eaten chunkier and juicier wings, price-performance ratio isn't good. I'll suggest you save your money and skip that. Service was fast and friendly. Not a good place for conversation though. So, was the burger worth it? Yes, I would think it was well worth bursting my calories today for it. I will definitely bring my foreign friends visiting Singapore who are craving burgers, to try this place out. So 5 stars for the burger, until I chanced upon another burger that impress me more than this one did. Hope my review will help you in some way to decide if to dump $40 for a burger. Hahaha... I've tried. :)","1713":"This was hands down the best burger I have ever had in my life. I've been to countless burger joints in America, but Singapore's BurgerLabo outdoes this western dish by miles!!! I did a walk in when I went at 5:00pm (when they opened), but I would highly recommend you make a reservation, as it seemed like a lot of people reserved a table for later in the day. As for the meal, it was just amazing. I could taste the umami in the A4\/A5 wagyu patty with each bite, and the truffle fries were outstanding with a strong truffle flavor. Despite the pretty step price at $23 for the basic burger and $4 for the truffle fries with cheese, the experience is worthit. Do yourself a favor and indulge in this delectable burger! I will for sure be back at BurgerLabo the next time I visit Singapore!","1714":"Pretty legit place for Italian food. Being that it was Mother's Day the place was quite crowded. Nice selection of pizza, salads, pasta , antipasto, and wine on the menu. There are those who love it and then those who says a true pizza liver would never ... the Hawaiian, like it or hate it, I'm reviewing it cause that's what we ordered. The pizza arrived and all I wanted to say to it was \"oh, slice to meet you\" but my belly did most of the talking. It was genuinely good and I have to say that everything on that pie was nice and balanced. I would've prefer fresh pineapples (hey, this is Singapore after all, am I right?) over the can kind, but hey, most do it with the preserved stuff anyways. Can't figure out what kind of ham it was (shaved luncheon?) but it worked. \u00c2\u00a0The cheese and sauce was nice too. The only grumble I have is that the crust could've used a little more color, so another minute or two would've been perfect. But the kitchen seemed exceptionally busy so things may have been a bit rushed.The Spaghetti do frutti de mare was pretty decent with a generous portion of seafood. The sauce was a little too mellow and watery for me but okay, I'll eat it. A sprinkling of parmesan on top to finish off the dish would've been nice. Food coma setting in ... I wonder if that's why it's called a piZZzzzza?Service was really brisk and attentive by the well staffed front of the house. It didn't seem staff were assigned and everyone pitched in to provide great service. Will be back to try more from the menu.","1715":"Let me begin this review by first confessing that I am a pizza snob. Finding good pizza in Singapore has been the one difficult challenge of moving here six months ago, and I had high hopes for La Pizzaiola given positive reviews from fellow Yelpers. I ordered the Prosciutto Funghi Pizza expecting a toasty, deliciously thin pizza with fresh ingredients and was very underwhelmed. The mushrooms were from a can (not fresh), and the prosciutto just tasted like cold cut ham taken out of a plastic bag from Cold Storage. There was nothing else on the pizza that made it tasty nor distinct. I was hugely disappointed (see photo attached). The location is also in a highly residential neighborhood that is at least a 10 minute walk from the Serangoon MRT station. There are no buses that will take you this far in, either. Given how inconvenient the location was and how mediocre the pizza toppings were, I do not foresee myself returning here again.","1716":"Nice pasta!! Pizza, taste of home taste - more American than Napolian style.","1717":"The imported burratina here is a thing of beauty. Burratina is kind of like a ball of cheese where the middle is ricotta and the outside layer is intact mozzarella. My girlfriend and I took one bite and looked and each other with a knowing nod. We had found a new great restaurant. It came with thinly sliced prosciutto crudo, salad, and a few cherry tomatoes. Heaven.I think this was the same item as the $36 cheese appetizer we got priced out of at Valentino, except here it was $18.Here is their menu: lapizzaiola.com.sg\/image\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The other salad we had was also awesome, rucola with sundried tomatoes. The pizza was really good, not quite as phenomenal as the appetizers, but still excellent. We had the diavola, and at that point I was so excited and happy that it had arrived at our table that I forgot to take a picture.There is supposedly another location at Telok Ayer, which for all intensive purposes is closer to everything. It looks like their Ghim Moh location may have closed. I will do some sleuthing and report back.","1718":"If a restaurant is tucked away in an area that's hard to reach yet is always crowded, one can safely conclude that the restaurant is a gem of some sorts.Having been there twice, the lesson that I learnt is always call in advance to make reservations if you don't want to wait long for your table. Especially during the peak dinner time, you could end up waiting close to an hour. Cos there's really nothing much around, you can't 'walk off' and come back later unless checking out houses in the private estate is your thing.Some hot favorite includes their rocket and Parma pizza which I simply adore. The appetizer, some kind of a tomato base sauce with meat and mushroom on mashy-like dough was pretty good too. (apologies for the lousy description but I really can't remember the name).We tried the chef's specialty the first time i went there. It looked interesting with the dough baked over the pasta bowl with a mushroom and meat stew inside. We were told it's a classic Italian dish from the country side thus not many restaurant serve it. It taste ok. I feel it's a practical dish cos the people in the country would need their supply of starch and carbs to help them get through their day working hard in the fields but taste wise, nothing extraordinary. Their desserts look pretty good in the menu but I always save space for dessert at the cafe next door thus never had the chance to try. I do enjoy going there cos the service is good with attentive servers always coming by to check on you no matter how busy they are. Though the manager may get a little flustered trying to arrange tables while ensuring diners are still well served, he's a real sweetheart who make sure all customers are happy.If you can't finish the food, fret not, cod they'll gladly help you pack in a take-away box with a nice paper bag.","1719":"The last time we tried to come here on a Thu evening, the restaurant was completely full and they could only seat us 1.5 hrs later.This time, we managed to call ahead for a table.Eggplant parmesan as an appetizer is great. Gooey melted cheese, on thinly sliced eggplant and tomato sauce. Yummy.Pizza comes in one size - 12 inch. It's good enough to share among two persons. The ruccola-parma ham pizza has the most generous serving of ruccola on a pizza that I've seen. If you don't like the bitterness of this leave, then you will probably hate this. I love ruccola, so this pizza wins for their generous sprinkling of the leaves.Pizza dough - it is not thick, it is also not crispy thin. I like my pizza crispy, yet chewy, with a smokey wood-fire scent.....think Neapolitan pizza....this is not quite like it yet. Good, but not quite.I would eat it again, but it is not enough for me to crave it.","1720":"Outstanding little restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0Great service, the food was excellent! \u00c2\u00a0 Nice job! \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Had the Calzone and the Caesar salad. \u00c2\u00a0Wine was excellent! \u00c2\u00a0The table had pizza also and it was delicious. \u00c2\u00a0 Will definitely be coming back!","1721":"This place is a bit inconvenient to get to and parking can be a bit difficult however I really want to applaud the staff for making up for all of that by giving le girlfriend and me one of the best dining experiences we've had. We did not have a reservation but they did not turn us away. Instead, the manager explained to us that he had a table available till 9pm and that we could use it till then. We accepted and parked ourselves at that table for all of 2mins before a waitress came up to us to tell us that another spot has become available and if we moved, we wouldn't have to rush through dinner.We had the parma ham pizza and it was really good. I like more ham on mine while my girlfriend likes more rocket on hers so we were both pleasantly surprised when the pizza arrived with lots of both. The pizza was soft yet very slightly crispy and the rocket was as fresh as it could get. The ham was nice because it wasn't too salty like parma ham sometimes is. We also had a codfish that was really good. The fish was cooked for just the right time, so it retained its freshness inside without being too dry.I also ordered the \"default\" beer that I usually have at these Italian joints which was the Birra Moretti and it was a perfect way to top the meal off. There are more beers to choose from of course but the Moretti is always the best compliment to an Italian meal. They have a wide selection of desserts to choose from but we skipped to try dessert next door at wimbly loo instead.","1722":"The pizza is definitely 5 stars, really nice crust!. If you go for pizza only, you'll have a great meal. \u00c2\u00a0The pasta however was a let down. \u00c2\u00a0We had the ravioli and gnocci, and both were a bit bland and the sauce was watery. Therefore the pasta I'd give 3 stars.This is a great pizza joint, but I've had better pasta elsewhere.Definitely I'll be back for the pizza!","1723":"did a takeaway order for the bufalina & diavola pizzas, and i'm liking them. \u00c2\u00a0i've been searching for the longest time for something as good as Al Forno pizza (when they 1st opened opposite novena church and later Artz Pizza (East Coast Parkway)i want the crust a little chewy... and this is the closest one so far..gonna be back for more!","1724":"Went here recently for dinner. The Burratina con Prosciutto Crudo, as noted by others, is excellent. MAKE SURE YOU ORDER IT! We also had the Focaccia all'Aglio e Olio which was not that good, quite dry, and the salsa verde that came with it was very strange tasting. I tried drenching mine in olive oil but it didn't help much. My husband had a pizza which looked and tasted amazing. I had the sausage ravioli which wasn't great. Maybe stick to pizza. Great meal though and will definitely be back. They do takeaway as well and as I'm local that's where I'll be getting my pizza from.","1725":"Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos :)My family recently discovered a cute little Italian place near my house. We'd thought it wouldn't be too crowded since it's quite secluded but wow their business is so good!! But it's no surprise because their food is really good, and their prices are really affordable considering how good their food is!! We also found out that it is the second branch of the original La Pizzaiola at Jalan Riang, the one we went to is at Teacher's Estate, Kalidasa Avenue, but the menu is the same.We had a garlic bread for starters, but it's not the usual garlic bread. When it was served we were kinda surprised because it looked like a garlic pizza! But it was still really satisfying! There wasn't a very overpowering taste of garlic, which allowed us to taste the fragrant and delicious pizza base. I looove the doughy taste of the pizza, it was so yummy I couldn't stop eating!! Garlic bread was $6.90 which is so amazing cos it came out as a full pizza!!We also had the Diavola pizza, with spicy salami and tomato and mozzarella. Same as the garlic bread, the pizza was really fragrant and delicious. The spicy salami wasn't too spicy but it gave a nice kick and overall the pizza wasn't too meaty! By the way, their chili flakes are authentic and fresh, and VERY spicy! The pizza cost $14.90. So affordable!!!We also had an Aglio E Olio, which was less impressive, and a Risotto al Funghi, which is one of the better risottos I've ever had :)But I gotta say, what absolutely sealed the deal for my family was the desserts we had! We had a home-made Pear cake and a Melting Chocolate cake (lava cake) served with vanilla ice cream. The pear cake was sooo fluffy and the lava cake was possibly the best I've ever had?? Both weren't overbearingly sweet and the flavors were so balanced, my family was so full but we demolished the cakes within seconds. Overall the bill amounted to $82 for 4 of us, including service charge and GST. We didn't order wine or drinks though. We are definitely going back!!!Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos :)","1726":"The four cheese pizza was one of the best meal we had here. Their gnocci is also good. Service was good. The restaurant isnt so easy to find but it was worth it","1727":"Very nice place, great food and service. Tried the Spaghetti Arrabbiata extra spicy with mushrooms and wife tried the pesto linguine with ham. Loved them and for dessert we tried the pistachio ice cream cake. A bit pricy and the portions are small but a great place for date night.","1728":"I'm a fan of this place! This is a gem in a quiet neighborhood, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting much at the beginning. The prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I had the squid ink gnocchi in crab meat sauce, and it was divine. I am especially critical about gnocchi because 1) I hate store bought gnocchi because they are always tough and too chewy 2) home made gnocchi has a wide spectrum of variation, and I do prefer gnocchi when they are slightly on the pillowy, melt in your mouth type. For this dish, they err on being a little too soft, but I didn't mind at all, especially with a tomato crab sauce that tastes home made and fresh. For the pizza, the crust was thin and delicious, and the tomato sauce also tasted home-made. The burratini was very milky and soft, it's not as good as the one from Etna, but it's almost half the price, and I have to give points for their tomatoes. The cherry tomatoes served with the burratini was sweet and low acid, and reminded me of tomatoes in Italy. In all, I thought that the meal was almost underpriced, given the effort put into the dishes. Would go back soon. :)","1729":"great pizza at below-market prices in this hidden neighborhood in serangoon - incidentally, a good precursor to a couple of waffles at wimbly lu. thin-crusted pizzas with a good amount of toppings - but not so thin you can't taste the dough - especially good because they know how to let it get to a decent char.we stuck with their eponymous flat-topped breads this time - starting with garlic bread, which came as a sort of pizza-primer with garlic slices strewn over. decent, though not the buttery crusty-french-loaf affair we wanted.the entr\u00c3\u00a9e pizzas were as we'd expected, and more - a satisfying-but-not-over-the-top amount of cheese and sauce beneath tasty toppings, and can I tell you how impressed I was by all that blistered charring? our prosciutto e funghi, and an off-the-menu (which they very nicely accommodated) meat lover's delight of sausage and ham were both good, though not gourmetish - just good renditions of a great-for-a-casual-dinner-pizza.a mixed salad was vibrant and crisp (and generously portioned) - and oh, a shout-out to the dried chilli flakes - these aren't the insipid bits you get in your home-delivery box but house-made by drying lethal chilli padis. fragrant and incredibly spicy.we finished with their chocolate lava cake - which was deep and dark and oozy. enjoyable, though it was the most miserly-portioned dish of the night (and proportionally, the most expensive), barely enough for a person.the only thing I haven't mentioned is you will leave smelling of garlic and cooking - we barely smelled anything in the restaurant, but the 'aroma' on our clothes was immediately noticeable when we left. so - don't come for a date and expect a romantic time after - unless you're both into that.good food, good prices, and if you get a reservation - it's a nice casual bistro great for the weekdays.","1730":"RIGHT ON THE GROUND FLOORIn the North Toa Payoh are some of the very first government residential highrises in Singapore. Only permanent residents and natural born citizens are eligible to purchase or rent. 85% of Singaporeans reside in government housing. On the base floor of each highrise will be an open air food court. Essentially nobody cooks above in their condos. They just go down to the ground floor and order. Talk about convenience. Not unusual to find a multi-generational family operated restaurant(s). Our friend Sonny has been eating @Hong Sheng since he was a youngster. Our order taker reminded Sonny that she hadn't seen him lately. He could only smile. The predominant language spoken here is Cantonese and so is the cuisine. A nice change from the hawker food centers. Unlike in America, the portions here are much smaller as in individual size. However, it allows for more variety when ordering. The whole experience was better than eating at home. Ah, the durian puffs and almond soy putting are next.","1731":"It's really a test of my willpower whenever I walk past this zhi char restaurant on my way home. What kind of heavenly aroma is that?! And the worst is I've tried almost all their dishes - this is the unofficial gathering place for my extended family.My favourite dishes include: The Har Qiong Gai - this aroma triggers automatic salivating response. The Claypot Fish Head - Very thick full-flavoured gravy and fresh white meaty fish. The Hor Fun - which is served on a huge leaf. The taste of this hor fun is very unique and instantly recognisable. It's not as watery as the other hor funs out there, but it's still smooth, complete with that smoky fragrance.My friends in Geylang and Tampines have travelled here to have dinner, it's that famous. People like me, who have the luxury of staying close by, have to make advance reservations at least an hour before.","1732":"I came here on recommendation from a Friend. And I fell in love. The dishes here are not fantastic but just have the \"made at home\" taste and the fishes are fresh and huge and not expensive as compared to the price you pay at other Chinese Tze Char or restaurants especially. The rice is free flow as the Uncle will thank you for self-servicing and then keep asking you to take as much as you want. The thing I like about them is that The Uncle and Auntie make it a point to ask how many pax are having dinner and would advise against over ordering. They are ever so amicable and friendly and I feel so at home with them! (Sometimes the auntie could be pulling a face but she is still okay)Typically the wait here longer as there are the only two of them and the auntie does the taking of orders, serving, cleaning up and washing. So don't expect to come here and be served quick else you are gonna be an angry man or woman. I ordered the Steam Fish, Fried Egg with Prawns, Cai Po and Sausage and \u00e5\u00a5\u00b6\u00e7\u0099\u00bd. Damage?? S$50!! How's that?!","1733":"Awesome, awesome food. Highly recommended!I would say that this is my idea of a really good meal. It's better than a buffet, because you get a lot of variety in tasting portions. And since they serve everybody almost the same things (based on the seasonal ingredients), you get the assurance that your food is cooked perfectly (which it is!).I would say that from the 14(?) dishes that were served, everything were good, and about 90% is EXQUISITE! :) My favorites: The beef cheek (so soft and jelly-like!), and the truffle pasta!!!","1734":"This place is a gem, since I don't particularly go to Greenwood Ave much as it is rather 'ulu'. I didn't expect that within the same stretch of shophouses, there are at least 3 different Italian restaurants. However, Fratini caught my attention as she has a no menu restriction. Everything will be chosen by chef Gabriel and all you need to do is totell him what you don't or can't eat. Lunch started off with very tasty appetisers. The prawn is sauteed with pumpkin puree and avocado mash. I could eat more than a portion of this. The scallop with cheese was satiating. Presentation was good. The main pasta was al dente. I would say that all the food was from the range of good to very good. The set lunch is at $45++ which is reasonable. I will definitely be back again. I would like to have some crayfish the next time I am here. :)","1735":"This an absolute gem of a restaurant. There is no menu and the owner goes round to each table to see what your likes\/dislikes are and if you have any allergies. He also recommends wine and they certainly have an amazing selection. The food was excellent. It has been a while since I've had such a good meal and it really was like being in Italy. First and second courses are a selection of fish and meat dishes. Each is just a mouthful or two but fantastically prepared. The last main dish is an individually prepared pasta, we could see from the other tables that none of the dishes were exactly the same. Dessert was a small selection of tasty treats, again no more than a mouthful or two. Despite each dish being quite small we were perfectly full by the end of dinner. All of the staff were fantastic and the atmosphere is nice and cosy, I actually forgot I was in Singapore as it was so much like being in Europe!Not a cheap evening but well worth it for a special occasion; I will definitely be back!","1736":"It seems like sharing plates was the theme for all my birthday meals this weekend. I had dinner at Bar-roque Grill the night before with 6 family members while tonight's dinner at Fratini was with 5 of my childhood friends. Though the French and Italians will probably snuff at anyone comparing their \"pride of my mama's table\" cooking, I will.I thought Fratini offered a way more enjoyable, bang for your buck, well paced and homely meal. Before you say well hey, isn't Bar-roque going for more of a fine dining angle? I'd say if the chef \"plumbs his roots\", serves \"large familial portions\" and his mum's apple pie is a star dessert, we're talking bout the same concept here and modern Alsace vs. Pescara cooking becomes a discussion on semantics and style for the chefs.First on the food, I liked that Fratini offered almost 10 dishes (I lost count) that had different textures (roasted, fried, grilled) and flavor combinations. My favorites were the roast pork, which was like an Italian siew yoke, braised beef cheek with black lentils - common cheap cut at a lot of restaurants these days but Fratini's was braised well enough that it *melted* in my mouth. The fried squid was a winner too but then again welding a fryer isn't a standout skill at this level. All our dishes came just as we were finishing the last and the waiter introduced each one, which was great pacing.In contrast, while the grilled octopus at Bar -roque was unique, the seafood and meat platters we ordered kinda ran into each other texture and flavor wise. The seafood pan for example comes with a delicious broth for you to spoon over the fish et al, but its essentially one flavor and a stew. The meat board had a very well grilled ribeye but again, all the meats were from the oven so it wasn't interesting. Our plates were also served with long wait times in between which was cited by all my family members as a killjoy. I mention these things because if you're gunning for a sharing plates concept, people either need to be worshiping your grill skillz (for a roast\/grill platter) or be wowed by the different flavors\/textures to warrant sharing their plate with 5 others in a fork battle. Otherwise I would just order my own dish to my liking.I felt Fratini was a lot less pretentious though he maintained a how do you put it...semi-fine dining level of service and presentation like Bar-roque. We saw chef Fratini and his wife almost 4x during our meal, which really made us feel taken care of and this goes for other tables too. At Bar-roque we had an Aussie waiter who explained our menu well (though with a bit of sass \"oh you need to order the duck 4 days in advance. Not to rub it in but the table next to yours has done that\"), service was just proficient and unobtrusive; then \u00c2\u00a0the pace dropped significantly after the starters.Lastly in terms of value, you get very well fed at Fratini for $70\/head. I don't like to count change at restaurants but at Bar-roque I paid almost $100\/head ex wine and we were \"full\" from alot less food because we had to wait so long between dishes. So I will definitely be returning to Fratini many times more and maybe next time, score seats inside the restaurant.","1737":"A small restaurant helmed by a husband and wife team, who are both warm and friendly without being intrusive. There is no menu, but they will ask for, and accommodate, requests if you have allergies or medical conditions once you are seated. Many types of seafood were featured during the meal, all very fresh and well-executed. The panna cotta is probably one of the best I have had locally. We had an excellent time and will definitely be back.","1738":"Fratini is a lovely place. Everyone is so incredibly friendly and helpful, they make you feel at home before you even sit down. And of course, the food is excellent. We had the tasting set, I lose count of how many dishes there were. They just kept coming. We had an incredible prawn in passion fruit, fried baby squid, veal, mackerel, roast pork, chicken and mozzarella, seafood tagliatelle... And I'm not kidding, that's just to name a few. We also had a really nice bottle of organic chianti, highly recommended. Will definitely be back!","1739":"This place was rated #2 on trip advisor and we'd eaten a lot of asian food over our short stay do decided to venture out. Is in a lovely neighborhood and run by a husband and wife team who put their heart and soul into their food and establishment. It's tiny which we love and we so appreciated the fact that you enjoy the fare for the evening and the chef puts out what is fresh and local and what calls. \u00c2\u00a0No menu, no choices, just sit down and relax and have a quiet evening with lots of amazing food brought to you over four or five courses and a pace that flows however you'd like. We had several plates of various appetizers and ended on an amazing pasta dish that had the right mix of seafood, sauce and pasta. \u00c2\u00a0You share plates throughout but it's not like tapas style - it's that you get a couple will get two sets of whatever is served and you each have your own. \u00c2\u00a0I would call the cuisine italian-fusion but much more on the italian side of things. . There were amazing italian flavors mixed in with asian flavors here and there with a great mix of seafoods. The chef comes by your table, serves, pairs wines and otherwise opens up his restaurant like it's his personal kitchen at home and invites you in to sit down, enjoy and relax. \u00c2\u00a0It was expensive but everything in Singapore is. We would recommend it for sure.","1740":"Husband and wife makes a great team. I like the relieve from having to decide what to eat. Food is good. Every dish is correctly portioned. Wine is also reasonably price. Enjoyable place. Overall a wonderful dining experience.","1741":"Interesting dishes. My fav is the spaghetti that kind of look like mee-poh. Al dente and soaked up the yummy seafood broth! Dessert was really good too. Apparently they change their menu everyday so that customers can go back often, but spaghetti is always on their menu. Yay!","1742":"This is a higher end Chinese restaurant. The price points are around $5-$7 per dim sum item, which is reasonable. We had a reservation for 11:30 am and we were one of the first ones to be seated since the restaurant opened at 11:30 am. My wife was offered a shawl just in case she was cold. The aunties made us feel like at home even though we were dressed rather shabby. The service was impeccable. Our tea was poured frequently and the staff was very attentive. The tea wasn't too hot and I felt it was the perfect temperature for the tea to steep at and to drink. I think the tea tastes a bit bitter when the water temperature for the tea is too high. The Jasmine tea was aromatic and flavourful, unlike the cheap stuff I'm used to at the dim sum places I frequent in North America. We were provided with hot sauce and pickled daikon (similar to the stuff found in Korean restaurants, but these were pickled with red peppers).The portions are smaller here. Some places use filler in the shrimp dumplings, but didn't seem like they used any here so the shrimp did fall apart easily. Chive shrimp dumplings were good too. The beef balls were nice and tender. The beef balls were properly cooked so the core wasn't pink and had an even texture. The xiao long bao had lots of soup in it and was flavourful. One of the best I've had. The dumpling didn't rip easily when handled so we were able to enjoy it properly. The egg yolk bun was adequately runny and was quite delectable. The BBQ pork pastry took a long time to arrive. It was burning hot when I had it, which was a sign that it was freshly baked (I burned my tongue). It had a crispy outer crust and it was wonderfully flavourful. There was more pork than pastry.As for my dessert, the mango pudding was good. It had texture as in I found mango chunks and mango fibres in it. So it wasn't just the pudding (like pure jello style). It wasn't too sweet with the condensed milk. It didn't look like pure condensed milk but rather a little light brown. It was presented well in a martini cup.Overall, I would definitely go again. Perfect date spot to go all dressed up.","1743":"One Michelin star Chinese (Teochew) cuisine in Paragon mall. Good food but not amazing. We ordered (1) steamed fish which was fresh, juicy though a tad bit overcooked, (2) seafood fried rice in lotus leaves - lotus leaves provided a nice touch but the fried rice lacks that lotus leaves fragrance that I was looking for, (3) fish maw - ok \/ standard, and (4) XO carrot cake, good but not amazing. Food-wise was a 3.5 star - expected a bit more from a restaurant of this caliber. But the service was very attentive \/ Michelin-star level - they even offered you a blanket in case you are cold. So 5* for that.Slightly expensive as you would expect from this sort of restaurant.","1744":"QQ Dumplings: 3.5 starsLooks like an adorable little elephant (\u00e5\u00b0\u008f\u00e9\u00a3\u009e\u00e8\u00b1\u00a1). \u00c2\u00a0Chewy rice flour \u00e5\u0092\u00b8\u00e6\u00b0\u00b4\u00e8\u00a7\u0092 dough.Prawn with Mango: 1 starI really didn't like this dish. \u00c2\u00a0It tasted like that cheap kind of mayonnaise\/cream cheese-based dish at Americanised Chinese restaurants and was too heavy and sweet.Noodle Roll with Salted Egg Yolk: 5 starsThis was amazing. \u00c2\u00a0It's a cheong fun exterior wrapped around the crispy fried lattice like those that come on taro puffs, and filled with salted egg yolk. \u00c2\u00a0Dip it in the savoury cheong fun sauce and it blows your mind.Black Bao: 4 starsXiaolongbao (soup dumpling) filling in an exotic-looking steamed bun.","1745":"What an amazing experience! Food was perfect and service was also. Pork belly was fabulous and the Peking duct was delicious. Will certainly go back.","1746":"We came for the Peking duck and we were not disappointed! The service was beyond excellent. While pricey, that is something one lives with or can expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. Next time in Singapore, this will be one of our \"go to\" restaurants.","1747":"Dim Sum LunchBest was the service from Ms Goh Chai Hong who helped me with a bag all the way to the entrance as I was in crutches. So kind of her.Ms Goh also offered my Friend and I shawls if we felt cold.White bait - lovely; light and crispy and not oily - very good.Teochew crystal skin dumplings with chives - good but I don't like the taste of chives, can be a little green.Meatballs - not bad although I am not into meatballsPomfret fillet porridge - goodDried Chilli shrimps on rice rolls - very niceXO sauce carrot cake with egg and bean sprouts - good","1748":"Crystal Jade- an appropriate name for a restaurant located within a mall that exudes elegance and sophistication. In this establishment you are to experience traditional dim sum perfected and refined to fit a high-class dining experience. I think at least, I've barely eaten anything.As I write this we're about 40 minutes into service and have received only 2 of 8 dishes that we had ordered. They did let us know upon entering that we would only have 1 hour since we didn't have a reservation, which is fine, dim sum barely takes any time at all! Come to find that again, each dish is taking rather long and tables around us are being fed multiple dishes before we've received our 3rd. We've gotten LOADS of tea though, they are very good at pouring and restocking our tea. Which is all we've been doing because there's nothing else to consume on this table.The dishes we did have are fine. They're fine. Worth the 40 minute wait? I'm going to have to reserve judgment since I've yet to taste our remaining 6 items.Our waitress let us know that there were complications in the kitchen, but I find that extremely hard to believe when most other tables have been served many plates of food and we are the only table that has been neglected. The only redeeming factor about this experience is that I ate beforehand. Despite that, this wait is inexcusable and I would exercise caution when dining with Crystal Jade.Update: We've finally received all of our food in exactly 1 hour. I can't imagine that they'd give us grief about staying here longer because we need to eat. My final judgment- it's fine. I can't imagine myself wanting this again or wanting to recommend it to friends. So as there is nothing exceptional being served here, I would only dine here if it is strictly convenient or you are dying of hunger. But even in the latter case you may be forced to wait some time so it may be a lost cause.","1749":"Great service, great food. the dim sum dishes we had were really good. to highlight some of them...the salted egg fish skin was really flavorful and crispy. so was the deep friend \"white rice\" fish. The char siew bao were soft and fluffy with great yummy filling on the inside. My favorite is the deep friend minced meat turnover. you don't get that in every dim sum restaurant here in Singapore so I am always very happy to find it on the menu and this particular one was very well made with a crispy exterior and a chewy glutinous interior. Not greasy at all.To avoid disappointment, I highly recommend making a reservation before heading down.","1750":"Very nice ambience and excellent food. Meals were served fast, service was good as well.","1751":"Amazing Chinese food! No matter it's the toasted pork, Peking duck or crab egg xiaolongbao, the restaurant did every dish to a perfection. Love the xiaolongbao, the crab yellow was so creamy, and generous in size. It explodes your senses. The hairy crab is a seasonal speciality and only available till mid November. Do not miss out your quota for the year. :) I tried the fried noodle pizza for the first time. The idea is to cut the pizza-like flat thin noodle into small pieces. First spread a thin layer of sugar, and use a spoon to drip a few drops of vinegar. Viola, crispy, slight sweet and sour. I never ate deep fried food, but was tempted to finish almost one slice..Steamed sea bass was also a delicacy. One spoon of fish soup into rice, and eat it with the fish, rich and yet refreshing.The staff was well trained, friendly and very attentive, made all the right recommendations. The restaurant also sells its own branded chili sauce and xo sauce.","1752":"This was our second time at Crystal Jade. This time we sat at the bar because we didnt make a reservation but the staff here as usual were super friendly and nice they always make me feel welcome. The bar area was actually quite comfortable. I ordered a few things such as the duck egg fish skin, soup dumplings, custard buns, pork belly and foie gras. However, minutes after there was some kind of alarm and apparently one area of the kitchen had water sprinkler going off and it was the area that made the pork belly and foie gras so were not able to get our dishes. The fish skin was delicious it was light and not too heavy with the egg yolk. The soup dumplings unfortunately all explored and we lost the broth in the dumpling. The custard buns were great!","1753":"It's probably best if I didn't tell you how often I was at this restaurant for Sunday dim sum brunch. Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I manage to con different friends to get my dim sum fix at this place week in and week out. Because their dim sum is just.that.damn.good.What's not to love about little pillows of shrimpy\/porky goodness???There's nothing happier to life than baskets of dumplings flowing towards your table to be consumed. Each of this little morsels are crying out EAT ME. So I do. Shrimp dumplings, xiao long bao, teochew crystal dumplings, cute little jumbo shaped dumplings, XO fried carrot cake, shrimp rice rolls, beancurd rolls, etc. etc. You just can't go wrong. Ask for the \u00c2\u00a0(doubanjiang) for dipping and you're good to go. Because everything tastes better with a little chili kick. -1 star for service because they never seem to get it quite right.","1754":"Really like this place for dim sum lunch. \u00c2\u00a0Great venue, better food, ok service (...even though after the one Michelin star it got way too busy)","1755":"It has been a few years since I revisited this place, and I was glad I did. The dimsum still maintained their usual standard, and I just generally find their decor very tasteful, and it is a great place to catch up with friends. I can't think of a single dish that stood out as being outstanding, but the general caliber of the dim sum is pretty damn good. I like the good service here as well, and that it's not too loud compared to other dim sum joints.","1756":"Unnecessarily cold: Four stars for food but the temperature of the restaurant make it virtually unsuitable for children and most adults (we brought a three-month old and a toddler). I asked two staff members to see if they could raise the temp but one said it wasn't possible and the other said \"oh we just got the air con serviced so it's much colder now...I can't adjust it\". I'll assume he's speaking factually and CJ should assume I am too when I say we won't be back.","1757":"Mixed-menu - this restaurant serves Cantonese and Teochew food. I would recommend the Teochew goose, cold crab, bamboo clams and their daily soup. The pig's stomach soup is also excellent - I highly recommend that - the soup is peppery, and the texture of the stomach is done to a precise consistency - not too soft or tough and very palatable.Great ambience and great food makes this a perfect place for family dinners. The service at this Paragon restaurant is also excellent, I couldn't recommend it enough. The waiters are attentive and professional.","1758":"I remember coming here with my cousin, the food was really and the service was good as well. I would recommend coming here if you visit Singapore!","1759":"very good chinese food.. ridiculously expensive.. the bbq duck is excellent.. our friends enjoyed their winter melon soup.. cereal prawns are excellent.. service was also quite attentive.. the reason it doesn't score higher is the price.. maybe i'm used to prices in southern california or vancouver where you can also get world class chinese food","1760":"Another one of my favorite Teochew restaurant, the other being East Ocean. Great service good food but n the pricier side","1761":"For a foreigner this was a great experience. Good authentic Chinese food. Didnt know what I was eating but all goiod.","1762":"Excellent French food in a nice micro brasserie environmentFred and his team do an interesting fusion of traditional French brasserie dishes and new cuisine influence. You'll be delighted for sure and definitely find it is reasonably priced for the quality of the experience.","1763":"Nice, classic French brasserie. We had the hanger steak, lamb, and escargot. The meat was pretty standard fare, but the escargot were quite special, served in shell and with generous helpings of pesto.Seems like a lot of the customers were regulars, a lot of families with kids in tow. Very friendly service, servers knew most of the regulars by name.My only quibble would be the wine list - good selection, but quite overpriced.","1764":"Great little brasserie in trendy Tras St area, a little slice of France in Tanjong Pagar. Unpretentious, but a place you could dress up for. Dimly lit, but with plenty of noise and conversation. \u00c2\u00a0Service is relatively prompt. Waiters clipped and efficient but friendly enough. We ordered a salmon tartare($24) to share for entree, which was a good thing as it was a very generous portion, more than adequate to share. Avocado, lettuce, dill and capers made for a very fresh and tasty starter. My main was ribeye with bearnaise and frites ($48). When it first arrived it looked \"meh\", but a quick slice open revealed it was cooked to perfect medium rare done-ness. Nicely seasoned and with a good 'crust'. The bearnaise was EXCELLENT and I had to try hard to not smear More onto my steak and end up with a heart attack. Frites were pretty standard, but generous. My partner had St Jermaine scallops with spinach and porcini. Very tasty, well cooked scallops on a bed of spinach with what I think was confit garlic. Unfortunately we left no space for dessert, but I want to try that cheese plate....A special mention for the bread. Very, very good bread. Definitely will be back to try something else. Maybe the salt cod...or the rabbit....or the pork stew....or the lemon sole......or the welsh lamb....","1765":"Last week, coworkers and I had the pleasure of having a business lunch at Brasserie Gavroche, an upscale French Bistro on Tras Street. \u00c2\u00a0(Its sister restaurant Cafe Gavroche is directly across the street). \u00c2\u00a0This was my first visit here, and I am now a huge fan. \u00c2\u00a0The food, the ambiance and service were impeccable. \u00c2\u00a0 The shop house's bright dining room is simple and elegant with french themed decor. \u00c2\u00a0I'm interested to see how the dimmer lighting at night transforms the space into a different feel. \u00c2\u00a0There's a full service bar near the entrance. The staff were on point. \u00c2\u00a0The presentation of the large wood framed menu was impressive and there's a remarkable amount of choices in each category. \u00c2\u00a0I selected the Ribeye Steak Frite ($48) and it was AMAAAZING! \u00c2\u00a0The 300g portion of beef was perfectly seasoned and seared - crispy on the outside and perfectly rare on the inside. It's up there with Luke's or Morton's quality and one of the best steaks I have had in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Served with a generous portion of perfectly cooked fries and bearnaise sauce. After we cleaned our plates and several glasses of wine later - \u00c2\u00a0we ordered a selection of desserts for sharing. \u00c2\u00a0Too high on life to remember them, but I had a bite of each and they were top notch (See the photos)The Good: \u00c2\u00a0A nearly perfect lunch. \u00c2\u00a0The Ribeye Steak Frite was delicious. \u00c2\u00a0The staff was friendly and helpful.The Bad: \u00c2\u00a0It's too pricey to be my new go to neighborhood lunch spot. \u00c2\u00a0I would not be able to resist ordering the steak frite each time. \u00c2\u00a0I must work harder to get a promotion and a raise.The Verdict: \u00c2\u00a0Yes. Yes. Yessssss!","1766":"I've been a little sick of fusion food so I wanted a place with traditional French food - no surprises lurking around my plate for me!I had the escargot to start, and I felt it didn't have enough garlic in it. Tasted more like a green pesto with heaps of parsley spooned on top of escargot. Don't touch the metal plate they're served on - it's HOT! I burned myself while shifting the plate.Next up was scallops on a bed of asparagus in a cream sauce for my main. My four scallops were seared BEAUTIFULLY. I could find no fault with the dish. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes, and yes, they were flawless too.My friend had the lamb, and while they didn't ask him how he wanted it done, it came sliced and was done rare. Beautiful way to treat a great piece of meat (I'm not being sarcastic). I love lamb done rare, but if you don't, be sure to mention it!Dessert for me was the Cr\u00c3\u00aape Suzette, which they lit up in front of me, with blue fire dancing on my plate. I wish they'd put more alcohol so the fire would char some of the sugar off! My crepe came smothered in a very sweet Grand Marnier sauce. It wasn't too bad but it was too sweet for me. My friend's rhubarb tart was disappointing too, with some crumbly tart AND rhubarb paste under it. HMMM. I guess they don't do desserts very well here.No fear, come here for everything but dessert, wash it down with some Billie Salmon champagne, and go for dessert elsewhere. Enjoy!","1767":"For some reason, my family wanted to try French. So I did the usual search, read reviews and decided to try this restaurant and I must say, I am not disappointed at all.Located on a street just off the main thoroughfare of the Central Business District, the restaurant boasts a fine patronage of diners, mainly Caucasians and occasional locals. As you step into the place, you immediately get a feel of the Parisian air. We ordered the usual French fare; traditional onion soup, smoked salmon salad, shredded duck confit and the lobster and seafood \u00c2\u00a0with bechamel sauce and the escargots done in burgundy and garlic butter.My daughter who had the onion soup exclaimed that the bowl seemed bottomless, so you could imagine the portions of the servings. My favorite was the lobster and seafood dish. The cream was not too rich. There was a generous helping of the seafood. Personally, I felt that the escargots could do with a little bit more of the garlic butter, nonetheless, what I had was pleasant enough. The service was impeccable too. The French butlers were attentive and non discriminatory, unlike others, who tend not to want to serve the Asians.This restaurant certainly has my vote for good food and good ambience. I will definitely make a second visit.","1768":"Classic french bistro in the Tanjong Pagar area right by the financial core. Reasonable price, excellent wine collection, and attentive service makes this place a regular for me and my friends. Menu does change from time to time but what won my heart was their sweetbread, foie terrine, bone marrow, and when was the last time anyone attempted fish quenelles?","1769":"Best French brasserie in singapore. Interior design, service, food, wine, everything is there, good, attentive and authentic. The menu is well balanced between classic brasserie food and more sophisticated meals. I love the generous portion of foie gras, the fantastic quenelles, the list of Bourgogne wines...","1770":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and a second for dinner. Skip lunch and come straight for dinner!! Order the steak! Order the tartar..delicious! I don't know about you, but eating a large chunk of steak isn't usually how I do lunch--I'm a lady after all. I save my bloody meat thirst for dinner, complemented with some fine wine, and \u00c2\u00a0Brasserie Gavroche definitely delivers. I dined with three others and we all enjoyed our meal. Well, I didn't enjoy my entree but I fell in love with the wine and dessert! We ordered the tartar, flank, steak, and veal. The steak was the star of the show--juicy and earthy due to the grass-fed cow from Ireland. Who knew Ireland produces such good steaks?! The next star was the veal. The description of the menu does not do it justice. Though I only had a small bite, it was everything I dreamed of but more! \u00c2\u00a0I would personally pass on the flank and veal. The veal was my dish and I knew from the first bite onwards, I had made the wrong choice. Others in my party enjoyed it, but for me..meh. Though I had ordered the veal medium rare, it was tough nonetheless. I like my veal to be extremely tender and I really couldn't taste the difference between the veal and the flank. The flank was good, but nothing compared to the steak and tartar.For dessert, be sure to get the baked Alaska with brandied cherries! Once it arrives, they set it on fire in front of you! Hot damn! The chocolate is rich and dark and draws you in with the mouthful of brandied cherries. The Alaska is a decent size so I definitely recommend sharing it among friends. Brasserie Gavorche had a great wine list and for the price of the meal ($60 for food and wine), I couldn't have asked for anything better.","1771":"My go-to Brunch Place in Singapore.I love the food and ambience here and being tucked away near the CBD means there are no crazy queues during brunch time. Hate to share the secret with everyone but this place deserves high mentions. In particular the brunch bread basket (2 chocolate pains, 2 warm croissants and 1 freshly baked baguette) with a side of 3 jams and french butter is my absolute favorite. The hot items are consistently consistent and delicious but i end up getting the omelette each time due to me being vegetarian. I also love the A la Folie mocktail that one of the owners make. Its some strawberry, mint, basil, sprite concoction that is amazing!I've brought a number of folks over to the restaurant and they've all loved the place. Havent had a chance to go during non-brunch hours but the menu looks very meat centric so I may give it a pass. I'll be back continuously for brunch though.","1772":"Great, authentic French food. Quality is similar to something that you get in France or NY. However, the palate is definitely skewed towards being authentic rather than being adapted to local tastes. Meaning it's skewed more towards the heavier and saltier side. However, still great classic French dishes.I had the ox ribs and they were excellent. The meat was soft and falls off the bone. I would say that this is the dish to try at Gavroche.Decor and ambience is a 5 star. Would definitely be coming back here.","1773":"Decently executed French cuisine in a beautiful restaurant. But the food is okay and way too expensive for what it is.It's a little above average, but the prices they're charging are not.We had a bit of everything when we went to celebrate a friend's return from abroad, and while we liked it enough -- we certainly didn't dislike anything -- the hefty bill was a tad detached from the reality of what the food really was.I'm going to have to think very hard next time someone wants to come back here.","1774":"Brasserie Gavroche offers the quintessential French brasserie experience, a pity though the food isn't quite up to standards.Food : I wanted so much to like Brasserie Gavroche as I had heard rave reviews from foodie friends and the media had lauded it with glowing praises. However, I thought the French onion soup merely average and the fish quenelle with crayfish sauce similarly so. Friend who also had the French onion soup and the salted Mediterranean cod with crushed potatoes and olive oil concurred with her choices as well. Ambience : Very authentically French brasserie-like, I actually quite like the interior designService : Quite goodMost disappointing.","1775":"Beautiful little place with nice atmosphere. The hostess\/waitress was inviting and warm and very knowledgeable. Had the special of the pistachio chicken and it was wonderful!!! Glad we found it","1776":"One thing that I like about this place would be the speed. My food was served in less than 15 minutes, I ordered a chicken with two side dishes. Prices here are in my opinion pretty fair, the bill came out SGD 9.90 I would say it is affordable if you would like to exchange the price to MYR. Overall, I would say that this is a place worth visiting!","1777":"My hubby likes Aston so when we heard one opened here near our home, he's quite excited to check it out. We ordered:Beef Bolognese - the Spag is cooked a dente and the sauce is ok. But it's a case of sauce over noodles and tossed over. The taste of the sauce doesn't 'drape' over the noodles so its kinda like the ones you find in food courts\/hawker stalls. Can skip this one the next time. Mushroom Soup - this came first and my 2 piranhas finished it before I could get my spoon in! It's either it's damn good or boy were they hungry. New Yoke Strip - essentially a larger piece of sirloin and I had it with coleslaw and potato salad. Prime Ribeye Extra Cut - My hub is a fan of meat, beef in particular. Astons for him is good as its value-for-money for a generally ok cut of beef slab with two sides. Sausage Platter - there are 3 different sausages in the platter and I liked the darker ones better. The lightest one I think was chicken and found it rather bland. My daughter turned out to be a fan and abandoned her own food to attack mine. Astons is not certainly not gourmet but a good place for a hearty meal while your kids will love the play area next door more!","1778":"My hubby likes Aston so when we heard one opened here near our home, he's quite excited to check it out.

This is my favorite prawn noodle place and for it to be near my place is even better. The only drawback is getting there if you drive. There is very limited parking available and you may be better off parking in the residential area nearby. Or take the bus, the bus stop is right in front of the restaurant. I will only drive here in the non-peak afternoon period. Otherwise it is the bus for me even though it is only a couple of stops away. The heat of Singapore makes one wilt, so no walking under the hot sun. The soup has been consistently umami with a rich prawny taste. However I thought the soup lacked the customary flavor on my last visit. I hope it is a one-off thing as I would hate to think the standard has drop. The small portion is quite tiny with just 4 prawn halves for $4. Maybe it is time to get the bigger portion now. I like the ngoh hiang. The prawn fritter was so crispy and fresh. The dipping sauce was excellent too. I wished there was more of it though I think they would refill it if you ask. This place has been around for many years now and it has a friendly family feel to it. On my last visit, a domestic help came back with her takeaway order and told the staff her employer wanted just prawn noodles, not prawn with pork noodles. The staff was very kind and did not berate the help about the miscommunication in ordering (different languages after all) and instead told the help how to order it in future. And they cheerfully changed the order for her. I thought that was very kind of the restaurant people.","1780":"Singapore is so well known for their noodles and food in general!!!!! Geylang Prawn Noodle restaurant has some of the best noodles!!!!! Served either in soup or dry these noodles are so tender and soaks up so much flavour!!!!! The toppings that you can add to the noodles add more flavour and texture!!!! You can add shrimp or pork bone ribs!!!!!!! The soup is also so rich, flavourful and pairs well with the noodles (This soup you'll want to drink and get every last drop!!!!!)!!! The fried onions and bean sprouts add a welcome crunch and deepen the flavour of the broth!!!! Highly recommend getting the fried tofu skin, fried fish cakes, 100 year old eggs and sausages as sides!!!!!!! All the sides are extremely delicious and are fried to perfection!!!! Definitely give this place a try!!!!!!","1781":"This is my favorite Prawn Noodle restaurant in Singapore. For that matter it's my favorite Prawn Noodle restaurant in the world.They serve Prawn Mee, Pork Rib Mee, and Pig's Tail Mee, and every combination of the three. You can have it wet or dry, with yellow noodles, bee hoon, or kway teow (or mixed). The prawns are big and fresh, the broth is rich and flavorful and the chili is excellent.I usually get the prawn and ribs, sometimes wet, sometimes dry. I always get the yellow noodles, because it is extremely difficult to find good yellow noodles in the States.While waiting have some excellent Ngo Hiang, and then finish your meal with some lime ice jelly.I have been here on weekends and evenings and have always been able to get a table. The people are friendly, the place is clean, and the prices are reasonable.","1782":"The broth tasted like it is made from ribs and prawn heads, a bit oily.","1783":"Soup is more on the salty side, prawn nothing special. Side dish on fried food.is very expensive","1784":"Great local taste good value helpful friendly \u00c2\u00a0people. \u00c2\u00a0I was introduced to this place years ago and it's still just the same. Mostly veery busy for lunch.I was asked if it was spicy? There is fresh cut chili on the table along with other local condiments so it is as hot or spicy as you like to make it. You can see I've already loaded mine up in the photo. There is also folded paper bowls (like origami) made out of old magazine paper for the bones and prawn shells. Old school and recycle!","1785":"Absolutely love the prawn mee here. Not because it's so convenient from my workplace but it's just different (good different of course) from many prawn mees out there. The stall looks pretty Chinese vintage with cushioned chairs and round stools. Don't worry about the hot weather as the fans are pretty effective.Lunch crowd can be a headache that's why it would be good if you come by around 3+ or 5+pm. Do note that they close early at 8.30pm!!I always order dry prawn beehoon+mee with chili. It's being served with a bowl of really awesome soup that is refillable (self service! Just walk to the kitchen). Food comes really quick even during peak hours! As a side snack, you can also get some ngo hiang which will come with this super delicious dipping sauce! I brought a few friends here and they all loved it!","1786":"Hmm.. this place missed the mark for me. I was told about it from a good friend who suggested it was the BEST PLACE EVER for Prawn Noodle but when all of my friends including myself got 1 to 2 bowls each, we couldn't even finish one because it wasn't that good. Overrated.","1787":"I am a huge fan of prawn noodles, and when I read the rave reviews about this place, I knew that I just had to give it a try.I usually like to eat my prawn noodles in the dry mode, so that I could taste both the gravy in the dry noodles and the prawn based soup that the stall has to offer. The best of both worlds, as they say. And the best of both worlds indeed, as both the noodles and the soup were equally satisfying.I ordered the version with both prawns and pork ribs. The prawns were very fresh, but the ribs were no slouch either; the meat was very tender and slid off the bone very easily. The component that really helps the prawn noodles here hit the home run is no doubt the fried chili. When you mix it with the noodles (with just the right quantity), the combination is really lethal. Writing about this actually makes me want to go back and eat it right now.","1788":"The soup compared to most prawn mee establishments is not as thick. However, it is still very flavourful.Nevertheless, i think adam road and jalan sultan prawn mee are better.Didn't try their premium prawn mee tho.","1789":"I'm not a great fan of prawn noodles but I sometimes grave for it out of the blues. When it does hit me, I am sure to make my way to Geylang Prawn Noodle. This place serves the best prawn noodles in Singapore IMO. The soup is tasty and full of prawn taste while the noodles are well cooked. Love it!","1790":"Good quality Japanese food in town. Small family business with 15-20 seats. Sashimi is fresh and sushi are great. Better than MOF!! At a very Reasonable price!!","1791":"We went for a whisky tasting event! The owner, the distributor and the whisky rep were awesome! The event also had a tasting of some tapas which were beyond amazing! The environment, food, drink and company really defines a fun venue that we'll visit again!","1792":"The place was so smoky I left smelling smoked. Some of my friends even had irritated eyes! We all were really desperate for drinks just 5 minutes in cos the smell was clogging up our respiratory tract. Perhaps we came expecting too much. It was decent but not memorable. They took forever to bring the beer. Apparently it was ready and just sitting there. And they had the decency to serve it, since it was already poured!? The food was not memorable. - Sicilian crostini with burrata and nduja sounded interesting but was overwhelming. Too much nduja made it too spicy and salty. - Stairway to heaven was generous with the amount of steak - it was seared medium-rare which was great but a pity it didn't marinate well. - Barramundi ceviche was ok but there were more condiments than fish - I got more onions than anything else. Luckily there was avocado. - Lamb croquettes were popular. For me the smoked lamb was still too gamey but at least edible. - Bone marrow was just fatty. I love fat, but there needs to be some salt and lemony. - Roasted cauliflower steak sounded so promising but it was half cooked and it's crunchy and tough. Not much flavor - flatbread is basically just stuffed pita. Bacon cheesy flatbread is decent but not special. Seafood flatbread was quite fishy taste. Definitely salt is needed. The Josef Pinot Noir wine was really nice to drink, a little bit spicy but flavorful. Probably the best part of the dinner!I don't think I'll be back. I'm not brave enough to deal with the smoke again!","1793":"Made a reservation for lunch. Was surprised that the place had quite a crowd for weekday, so it was a bit of problem of getting the staffs' attention. There's booth tables by the window. Nice but a tab shiny. Showed to a table near the booth tables with a good view of outside. Started with Wild Chrysanthemum Tea ($4++\/ per person). There was a la carte dim sum for lunch during weekday.Steamed Pork Ribs, Preserved Vegetables \u00e6\u00a6\u00a8\u00e8\u008f\u009c\u00e8\u0092\u00b8\u00e6\u008e\u0092\u00e9\u00aa\u00a8 ($7.80++)The pork ribs was fat and juicy but the surprise turned to be the preserved vegetables who tasted sweet instead of the usual spicy and salty. Crystal Spinach Dumpling \u00e6\u00b0\u00b4\u00e6\u0099\u00b6\u00e8\u008f\u00a0\u00e8\u008f\u009c\u00e9\u00a5\u00ba ($6.80++\/ 3 pieces)The skin was very thin and chewy. One could easily see the filling inside the clear looking skin. Crabmeat Fresh Prawn Dumpling \u00e8\u009a\u00a7\u00e8\u0082\u0089\u00e9\u00b2\u009c\u00e7\u00ab\u00b9\u00e5\u008d\u00b7 ($8.80++\/ 3 pieces)It looked and tasted like the typical har gow.Steamed Mushroom Siew Mai \u00e5\u008c\u0097\u00e8\u008f\u0087\u00e8\u0092\u00b8\u00e5\u008d\u0096 ($7.80++\/ 3 pieces)The taste was average. Like the popping effect of the prawn roes.Chinese Sausage Glutinous Rice, Baked Cod Fillet, Homemade Barbecued Sauce \u00e7\u0083\u00a7\u00e6\u00b1\u0081\u00e9\u00b3\u0095\u00e9\u00b1\u00bc\u00e8\u0085\u008a\u00e5\u0091\u00b3\u00e9\u00a5\u00ad ($8.80++)The dish was beautifully decorated with a flower, when served. The plain looking rice was savoury in taste, although one could not see any sausage in it. \u00c2\u00a0The cod was juicy and flavourful.Rum and Raisin Egg White Tart \u00e6\u009c\u0097\u00e5\u00a7\u0086\u00e9\u0085\u0092\u00e6\u008f\u0090\u00e5\u00ad\u0090\u00e6\u008c\u009e ($7.80++\/ 3 pieces)The tiny tart was simply melt in the mouth and gone in a mouthful.Pan-fried Radish Cake, Dried Shrimp, Chinese Sausage \u00e9\u00a6\u0099\u00e7\u0085\u008e\u00e7\u00bd\u0097\u00e5\u008d\u009c\u00e7\u00b3\u0095 ($6.80++\/ 3 pieces)Prettily decorated with flowers.

A sight that it had been cooked for long hours.Chilled Jelly Fish, Wild Mushroom, Szechuan Pepper Sauce \u00e5\u00b7\u009d\u00e8\u00be\u00a3\u00e9\u0087\u008e\u00e8\u008f\u0087\u00e6\u00b5\u00b7\u00e8\u009c\u0087 ($16++\/ small)It was spicy and crunchy.Chilled Pork Belly, Garlic Soya Sauce \u00e8\u0092\u009c\u00e6\u00b3\u00a5\u00e7\u0099\u00bd\u00e8\u0082\u0089 ($20++\/ small)Savoury and tender.Chef's Soup of the Day \u00e8\u0080\u0081\u00e7\u0081\u00ab\u00e7\u0083\u0088\u00e6\u00b1\u00a4 ($12++)It was Pork Ribs with Lotus Root. The pork ribs was very tender and juicy. The soup was very flavourful.Almond Cream with Snow Fungus \u00e7\u0094\u009f\u00e7\u00a3\u00a8\u00e6\u009d\u008f\u00e4\u00bb\u0081\u00e9\u009b\u00aa\u00e8\u0080\u00b3 ($10++)The mixture was smooth and not too sweet.Creamy Black Sesame, Peanut Glutinous Rice Ball \u00e9\u00a6\u0099\u00e6\u00bb\u0091\u00e8\u008a\u009d\u00e9\u00ba\u00bb\u00e7\u00b3\u008a\u00e6\u00b1\u00a4\u00e5\u009c\u0086 ($10++)Rich and creamy, without too sweet.Chilled Coconut Jelly Cake, Black Glutinous Rice Cream \u00e6\u00a4\u00b0\u00e6\u00b1\u0081\u00e7\u00b4\u00ab\u00e7\u00b1\u00b3\u00e7\u00b3\u0095 ($12++\/ 3 pieces)Refreshing and creamy in taste.","1794":"Nice ambience and good service, but the food is very average and tends to be too salty. The Szechuan dishes are not as good as Si Chuan Dou Hua's, and a signature (Cantonese) dish we had was no better than Crystal Jade Kitchen's. Not worth it without the Entertainer discount.","1795":"The Peking duck was not crispy enough. The duck noodle was way too salty. Almost non edible. The noodle should have come earlier.The spinach and trio eggs was good, something special. The pawn with creamy salty egg was small portion but not too bad. The braised tofu dish was ordinary. Overall is quite expensive.","1796":"Came here twice recently. \u00c2\u00a0Once for lunch with few co-workers and another time for a company dinner. \u00c2\u00a0Both times, I did have a great experience and enjoyed their food. \u00c2\u00a0I was going to initially give this place a 3-star but there is this very cute Korean waitress (didn't know that she was) who made the entire experience even more enjoyable. \u00c2\u00a0I would come here over and over again ;)","1797":"Szechuan Kitchen is my go to place for easy quick dinners on weekdays or working weekends. The soya sauce chicken is beautifully braised and comes with a very good sambal dip (can ask them for this cos it goes with everything else). If you have it with rice, they dizzle a lovely herbal sauce over it which is redolent with Chinese herbs. You can also opt for noodles.The wontons in chilli oil is delicious too - the chilli oil is szechuan style with the smokiness of dried chillies. The wontons are packed with crunchy prawns. The roast pork has good crackling and the roast duck is done well too. In fact, the stuff served at the Kitchen is more Cantonese than Szechuan but I'm not complaining. The dim sum is done quite well too, my Japanese friend loved the char siew bao and the cheong fun. If you're looking for a bargain dinner, the set meals are the way to go - generous three, four and five course sets starting from $18. And the best thing is it's still quite the undiscovered gem so there's always seats available.","1798":"This review is PURELY on the mooncakes.Every year during the Mid Autumn Festival, I find myself craving for Szechuan Court's Champagne Truffle & Chocolate Ganache Snowskin Mooncakes.Reason is simple: The smoothest lotus paste, and extremely well balanced flavor. nuff' said.To all those who claim Raffles Hotel's is good, you haven't tried this.","1799":"Very tasty flat white here, almost chocolaty in flavor! They also have some food options, but I didn't try any. Cozy digs, but with plenty of seating given that it appears to be very under the radar. Basically had the cafe to myself in the morning. Great for working in, as wifi speeds were very fast at 52u\/55d, and well placed, obvious outlets near tables. Chill and friendly owner; he mentioned that he roasts his own beans, a blend coming from South America. Love the dark roast here, and I hope to try some of his other preparations another day.","1800":"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. Cos the guy running it is really nice. Very warm and all round nice guy. Decor is welcoming and not so hipster it makes your teeth ache. The vibe is cosy and relaxed. We sat down and ordered breakfast. We were the only ones in the cafe. Dude running the place recommended the breakfast set - $12 for coffee and kaya toast with scrambled eggs. Sounded good so I ordered that. The BF went for hot dog. So we waited. And waited. 6 mins later the coffee came. We waited and waited. Dude went out to chat with cabbie friend. 20 minutes later, my kaya toast came. 2 slices of mass produced bread. Scant kaya on one slice. Scrambled eggs was fluffy and moist. But I can make this at home with better toast and more kaya. The hot dog took another 10 minutes. Probably cos he had to chop cabbage for the salad. Verdict : coffee is ok but the food is overpriced and meh. Can hang out for coffee. But the area has better food elsewhere. Sleepy neighbourhood joint is fine and good but this is too sleepy for my taste.","1801":"Impeccable service and delicious food. Roland and his team elevate the Singapore seafood dining experience. Conveniently located on the East Coast on the top floor of the parking garage next to the Marine Parade NTUC Fair Price, dine on local favourites like chili and pepper crab, crunchy baby squid and stuffed dough sticks (yew char kway). First, the nosh. I enjoyed the flavourful boiled peanuts with black bean and sesame tones offered instead of the usual roasted kachang (roasted peanuts). They asked if we wanted tea. (Tip: They do not have chrysanthemum tea.) We decided to stay with water instead. They brought out an extensive menu filled with Chinese seafood dishes that I grew up with when I used to visit Seafood Road on East Coast Road (Long Beach, Palm Beach, Redhouse, nearby Golden Lion). I was transported back in time. They have lovely pictures in the menu that helped with my decision-making process. We ordered two large male crabs: chili crab and pepper crab, market price was $72 per kilogram. It was more than $10 less that the market price at restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Center. The chili crab sauce was to die for. We sopped it up with fried and steamed mantou (slightly sweet bread). The black pepper crab was tasty. The crab meat was sweet and tender, but I have had crab that was fatter and more meat. However, it could've been a seasonal thing. They might've just finished moulting. \u00c2\u00a0The fried baby squid was heavenly. These half inch long morsels are sweet and savouring, serving up a distinct flavour and crunch. I felt sad that I didn't eat another plateful. Try it with a red chili sauce. Sweet and heat, Bobby Flay would've been proud.Another dish that had the sweet and heat thing going on was the fish paste stuffed fried dough stick (stuffed yew char kway). These come out hot and crispy. The fish paste was delicious. Dip it into the sweet flour and chili sauce that was hmmm, so good. My daughter licked it clean. They'd probably given us more sauce of we'd asked.Our last course was fried rice with tiny silver fish and crab. This dish was full of texture. I loved the crispiness of the fried fish that made the dish pop. I thought the crab was a little lost in the dish, but I enjoyed two bowls of it. I enjoyed eating it was a lightly seasoned plate of kailan greens.Just went I thought I could eat no more, they brought out orh nee, a traditional Teochew dessert or sweet taro paste. Unlike other orh nees that is sticky and oily, Roland's rendition is lighter and smoother, still maintaining its characteristic sweetness and slightly floral notes. My daughter enjoyed the light mango pudding with pomelo. That capped the evening on the highest note. It is one of the loveliest mango concoctions I have ever tasted. My daughter shyly asked for another round.While thinking about the food again makes me salivate, what sets Roland's apart is their service. When we made inquiries about the menu, the staff were friendly and hospitable, taking the time to go to the kitchen to answer our questions. When we made our reservations over the phone, they continued their extend their warm hospitality. Upon arrival, the maitre d' had our reservation on her list, then ushered us to a beautifully set smaller round tables. Roland's is a fantastic place to hold a banquet. The beautiful dining room is beautifully decorated with mirrors and lit low. The lights in the tanks added ambiance. Also, the restaurant is quieter than typical Chinese restaurants and conducive to conversations. The waitstaff were so attentive throughout the meal that I almost felt like I was at a French restaurant. Okay, I exaggerate a little, but still, they were super attentive and accommodating. It was a little surreal to be attended so closely while peeling and sucking on crab shells at the same time. However, I got over it very quickly. We couldn't finish our orh nee, and the wait staff quickly offered to package it home in a doggie bag for us. We all enjoyed our dining experience.Try Roland's for classy and comfortable way to enjoy Singapore seafood!","1802":"Good spot for chili crab. It's a bit hidden, a bit dirty, a bit dated but the food was good. It was a cool adventure finding this place during my visit to Singapore.Don't know if it's standard practice but they charge per piece for fried mantou.Price is right for the crab.","1803":"Roland is the FOUNDER of Singapore's famous Chilli Crab. It's hard to imagine that this is indeed the case when you have other more known establishments such as Jumbo Restaurant, No Signboard Seafood, and Long Beach Seafood spread across the Red Dot. Make no mistake about it, however, this is one of the BEST places to grab Chilli Crab in Singapore. Located on top of a parking lot!?!? This is where the locals, particularly those who live in the East, get their Chilli crab. In terms of the Chilli Crab itself, I'll second what a fellow Yelper said in her review. Roland delivers a Chilli Crab that is more chilli than sweet, the way it ought to be done. Many restaurants cook their Chilli Crab in order to cater to a foreigners' sweet tooth (ahem, Jumbo). I wouldn't say the dish is spicy, but it did have some kick resulting a little bit of sweat coming down my forehead. :DThe other dishes were solid. The Baby Kai Lan was absolutely delicious, while the Seafood Food Fried Rice came up way short (I wasn't a big fan of the crunchy like topping they sprinkled on the Fried Rice).Overall, if you are a big fan of Chilli Crab, Roland is a must try!","1804":"Singapore is know for many things, chili crab being one! Roland is a Singapore institution that is popular amongst the locals.As others have said, compared to other places, Roland's crab is more \"spicy\" than sweet, catering to a more authentic taste than other places that tend to have more of a tourist crowd. That said, I really enjoyed the chili crab and the group I was with ordered another!The atmosphere is nice - it's not overdone and you feel that you're in a \"Chili Crab\"\/Asian restaurant rather than some tourist joint. it's hard to describe, but once you look at the photos you'll understand. It has a really strong family vibe and, if you come late enough, you might be lucky to hear terrible Cantonese\/Mandarin karaoke next door which only makes the experience feel more authentic!English is a bit hit and miss with some of the staff but it's manageable.","1805":"Wah. The customer service here is really crazy. By crazy I mean good crazy. They are so attentive to clear your plates and top up your tea, but its not like I feel them hovering around my table all the time and spying on me.Probably they have some CCTV somewhere to secretly monitor our dining? Hahaha. Got crab and kai lan. Both were ridiculously delicious. But the calories should be insane since they put so much ingredients into the crab.Only caveat is that it's kinda ex.. But oh wells...","1806":"I have always wanted to try the Chilli crab that started all Chilli crabs but no chance till now! My best friends returned home from overseas and demanded to fulfill their Chilli crabs need. So I suggested to try Roland Restaurant, I mean they DID claim that they are the originator!! As the star dish of the night, I must say that their Chilli crab is indeed better than most I have eaten. This is because many restaurants cater to foreigners' taste buds and scale down their Chilli-ness to tomato sweet. Their sauce is thick with a hint of tomato sweet and yet still packed with even Chilli punch! Awesome!!!! The crabs themselves were fresh and meat was juicy and firm. Another star of the night has to be the Salted Egg Crab with yam. It's really salted egg sauce that's fried into the crab and they tossed in some yam fritters to give the dish extra crispiness, crunch and flavor!!! We had many other dishes and all beautifully done. As my best friend said at the end of the meal, \"Roland knows how to do it right\". The meal is not cheap but we had Sea Bass and drunken prawns and Broccoli with Scallops so it's rather worth the cost. Definitely bringing my family to try.","1807":"The restaurant is an institution in this island nation and they are the original creators of Singapore's famous Chilli Crabs! A must try for all seafood lovers! And good value for money!The restaurant is simply decorated but most diners are there concerned only with the excellent food that they serve and not the decor. They have an extensive menu that is sure to satisfy most! So if you're visiting Singapore and looking for a great meal this is one restaurant that you cannot afford to miss!!","1808":"Very tasty chilli crab, it is 800 gr and good for two person. (55 Sin. Dol.) Crispy noodles with prawns is also very good and really tasty. I will try there dim sum also during noon time.","1809":"The best chili crabs i have ever eaten! There is thus black sauce prawns dish that simply delectable! I have tried their other crab dishes and i have to say they are really so delicious too!","1810":"Awesome chili crabs! Every dish we ordered is so good. And on weekends they have push cart dim sum! Best part about their dim sum.. every item is only $2.95!","1811":"A big restaurant perfect for families and large groups. Very sweet chilli crab for S$60 per kg. We took some veggies and fried baby squid as side dishes. Although the chilli crab is a bit expensive it is worth its money. The sauce was very nice to add with steamed rice and the buns.","1812":"Pretty good, comparable Chinese food back home, even though I was here for a baby's one month lunch buffet celebration, impressed w\/ the noodles, pan-fried shrimp, stuffed tofu, and the chicken.Apparently known for its seafood & crab, not exactly the food of choice with babies and kids running around.Dessert pudding with the tapioca, was average since I prefer this more of a jello-feel, as this one's more of a soup.Massive restaurant, easily 300 seats, with plenty of private room action.Service quite impressive, as they topped up our glasses.One minor criticism is its lighting, not exactly the brightest.","1813":"I'll keep this review simple. As expected, the chili crab is excellent, and you should definitely order some fried mantous to soak up the sauce. The attire is casual, and you should probably wear some old clothing you don't care about getting messy. Alternatively, you and your friends can wear white t-shirts and use each other as napkins.","1814":"I came here with my classmates and everyone of us enjoyed the place and its food. We ordered the duck, black pepper crab, longevity noodles, Golden Beancurd, Teochew Steamed Seabass. I hope that my classmates and I can have a reunion here sometime into the future!","1815":"Picture yourself sinking your teeth into juicy, succulent and flavourful steaming crab flesh imbued with spices, and then swabbing the thick chilli gravy with chewy fried mantous (deep fried buns). The star dish for Singaporean cuisine lands at a respectable 35th position in CNN's World's Top 50 Most Delicious Foods (ousting his yummy cousin, the chicken rice, by 10 spots). If you're out for a big treat, Roland's the place to go!","1816":"Family and I frequent this place for its chili crabs. One of the best in Singapore IMO. Typical neighbourhood restaurant with average ambiance and service. Convenient location too. Overall, fuss-free nicely priced dinner. Good for family dinners!","1817":"The flavors. Omg... so good. \u00c2\u00a0So good!! We tried everything and the bill showed that we tried it all. They have this chicken soup dumpling that is off the hook. They also have things like duck feet. Yes I tried it and hated it. They have a crab meat and egg white scramble. That had a great flavor. Not bad for a restaurant in the mall. \u00c2\u00a0It is next to Krispie Kreme.","1818":"This brands has been Singapore for a long time. Has always liked the double boiled chicken soup with the la mian. It still on the menu and tasted just like before.The place was full of expats so it must be good.","1819":"Seng Kee The Black Seed is a casual eatery with Singaporean fusion. Chee cheong fun with redang curry, curry in bread bowls, and Hainanese chicken sandwiches. This casual Singapore fusion fare serves yummy local food with a twist and at at really good prices (you can have a complete meal for $5-$10.) The curry in bread bowls is the most popular. Really fills you up, and is good value for Bugis Junction.It is run by chef benny (from 13 chefs, and he also employs ex-prisoners). \u00c2\u00a0The entrance is OUTSIDE of Bugis Junction. It's near Intercontinental Hotel, and across from Honeymoon Dessert.","1820":"amazing service. the waitresses looked after us so well including our 1 year old and dog!the restaurant is supposed to have robot service but we sat outside because it was a beautiful night. they had a promotion on crab and beer... so pretty well perfect. we ordered pepper crab but we ended up getting a chilli crab. i was still pretty good. we also got some crispy octopus. no what i was expecting but pretty nice. the fried rice we also ordered was pretty nice but expensive i thought at $18 for a small one. admittedly it did have crab in it. still i probably wouldn't order that again. overall a really enjoyable meal at a reasonable price for what we got","1821":"Fun place with great service. They have robot waiters (and regular waiters) and a VR machine. Good, cheap food. Recommended!","1822":"Haven't been here for a while so decided to try it again. The steamed rice with Chinese sausage and chicken and the steamed rice with minced pork were quite good. The Claypot toufu was nice but slightly sweet. Our favourite dish, the Samsui chicken with grated ginger was, sadly, not as good as before. Loved it then but standard has dropped.","1823":"Great service from staff and yummy food. Love the chestnut meat pie and Claypot tofu, which are delicious and good value. Soup of the day is always tasty and thick, favorite being the melon fins scallop soup which I must say could be one of the best soups ever - though unfortunately only had it once so far, not sure why it's so rare to have it as the soup of the day. Please bring back the melon fins soup, thank you.","1824":"Not bad but not great. A little pricey for the quality of food but not a bad place for dinner.","1825":"someone needs to fix their service.but their food never fails to satisfy me.i like the fact that they give employment opportunities to the elderly.but proper training needs to be given regardless.staff numbers is not an issue here.but everyone just seems very busy and doing things haphazardly.after being seated and about to go through their menu, one staff took away the photo menu stand from right under my nose.i'm like what the???she proclaimed they are all the same!huh????how is it the same when the one she took away has photos and special dishes while the menu left behind is only with words and no specials?????whatever, i stretched out and retrieved it from the table she moved to!other key peeve: when another one of their staff was dishing out the soup, she suddenly left after completing only 2 bowls for our table of 5????sigh, DIY it is.on to the food:their peanuts are always nice and soft.soup of the day, cannot go wrong.lots of ingredients in an earthernware.samsui chicken, simple yet tasty.hometown fried fish belly is awesome!crispy boneless pieces of fish belly stir fried with spring onions and ginger.ah por sweet potato leaves is non spicy.if you want spicy ask for ah gong sweet potato leaves.a new item is the onion pork.lots of sweet onions, mushrooms and tender pork strips.","1826":"Was expecting an out-of-this-world experience especially with the traditional shrimp dumplings, \u00c2\u00a0xiao long baos, egg tarts (which are a must have at every dim sum for me) and chee cheong fun, but what surprised me most was their egg fried rice and fish porridge which blew me away. Something as plain as eggs with fried rice? Fish and porridge? They nailed it. Their dim sum tasted average though. Nothing much to rave about but of acceptable standard.Total bill amounted to almost $100 for 2 pax, because we ordered way too much dim sum.Will definitely recommend this place if you're looking to indulge in good food, but I won't return again because of it's hefty pricing.","1827":"I was at the Gardens by the Bay for the day and I was starving since I skipped breakfast. I'm usually not very picky when I'm really hungry. This place still fell far short of my expectations. The food wasn't very good and it was Way over priced. I ordered the dumplings, the \"siew mai\"(shumai), and the mushroom with asparagus. The best was probably the mushroom with asparagus and even that wasn't great as the asparagus was undercooked which is pretty shocking considering how long they made me wait for it. Big disappointment all the way around. Just skip it and grab a quick bite across the way at the fast food snack place and then get a good meal once you leave.","1828":"I have never had a more condescending manager than the guy running this place. Gave us the wrong dish then came back and told my cousin she did order this... but its really his attitude that was the worst. \u00c2\u00a0Dont eat here unless you like being condescended to.","1829":"This is the first and the worst restaurant i've ever try. They serve with a bad customer service and give me 1\/4 of duck instead 1\/2. I dont care about the price but their service really suck","1830":"After exploring the cloud dome we wanted some lunch and this place has just opened. It's really not the best spot to just grub for 2 people. Everything is served in portions designed for 2 people or 3-4 or 5-7. So just ordering separately isn't an option. The salted egg custard buns had a gritty texture to the custard. Pass on those! The chicken rice was delicious. Service was off. We ordered dim sum to start and had to ask for soy. Then we received a wee ramekin that wasn't big enough to share. No chili oil. We also had to ask for chopsticks and silverware. I wouldn't return.","1831":"Nice Chinese Dim Sim Restaurant. The portions are average sized and priced. The fried Koay Yeow was pretty good but spice. No free water. Mineral water cost $2\/- for a tiny bottle. Overall the food tasted pretty good.","1832":"This is a 2.5 for me. Much as I am a fan of Chef Pang's flagship Majestic restaurant at Bukit Pasoh, his newest restaurant fell short for me.To be fair, the items that fell short are the dimsum items. We took the set menu which included 5 dimsums and they all range from not good to average. The other few items we picked from the ala carte dimsum menu were not much better either. None of the dimsum items were good.Apart from the 5 dimsum items, the $28 per person menu also included a soup of the day, a veggie, coffee pork belly, lobster bee hoon, mochi dessert.The soup was amazing. Classic Cantonese double-boiled soup. We were informed that it was in the pot for 6 hours and you can tell. Thick and sweet and savory, exactly how a good double-boiled soup should be.The famed lobster bee hoon is great. For a portion for 4 pax, I think we get the whole lobster though not a big one. The bee hoon is nicely simmered in the lobster broth and it still retains the al dente bite. Yumz.The coffee pork belly was a disaster. I couldn't eat it. Though the menu says it is pork ribs, our entire plate was pork belly coated in this weird tasting coffee rub.We started with a geoduck done two ways - sashimi and steamboat. It was as amazing as how a fresh geoduck should taste. The broth that came with the steamboat was also really flavorful and you can taste that it is from a really superior stock.If I do return, I would probably stick to the ala carte menu and maybe the seafood items. But for a better experience, I would rather go back to his flagship restaurant.","1833":"For pictures and full reviews, visit my blog!The Majestic Group is pretty well known in the Singapore food scene. Following the success of Majestic Restaurant and Jing, Chef Yong Bing Ngen, best known for his contemporary Chinese cuisine, has ventured into the seafood restaurant market with his latest Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant. Expect some innovative seafood creations at this family friendly restaurant, which is quite a depart from the fine dining experience at the sister establishments.Located below the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, the spacious 110-seater restaurant is brightly lit by the natural light that streams in through the glass panels. \u00c2\u00a0To kick off dinner, we had the Duo Seafood Combo, \u00c2\u00a0($28 for 4 person portion). Crispy lychee, crab meat, mushrooms; soft shell crabs, lemon butter milk sauce. I much preferred the former, which was an interesting savory and sweet combination. The lychee is also a great tenderizer and i loved how the moist center complemented the airy and buttery crust. The crabs were missing a little of that crustacean taste, probably due to the over seasoning with the sauce and thick batter.A good gauge of a Cantonese restaurant is by the quality of its soups and Majestic is fabulous that way. The Braised, Ocean Sunfish maw, crab meat, luffa, thicken yellow soup ($18\/portion), , was very flavorful. The golden superior broth is made from a duck and chicken stock, blended with carrot and pumpkin and boiled for 6 hours! High quality strips of fresh fish maw and chunks of crab meat are used here. Flawless skin come to me now!Highlight of the night and undoubtedly the favorite dish. The Steamed Bamboo Clam, , (Market Price) was simply divine. The seasoning was really quite simple, leaving the focus on the succulent and crunchy bamboo clams. I love how the glass noodles (tang hoon) soaks up the garlic sauce that was flavored with the essence of the shellfish. Give me seconds anytime.This is the signature \"Kopi\" Crab, , that has tourists making a beeline to Gardens by the Bay. The Sri Lankan crab is cooked with a special sauce made from a blend of 3 different varieties of coffee beans. Marmalade and orange juice is also used in the sauce.The crab was flamb\u00c3\u00a9ed at the table with a mixture of rice wine, coffee liqueur and coffee beans to give it that caramel crust. And truth be told, it tasted more like caramel popcorn than coffee. If you like sweet stuff, you may like this crab. As for me, i still prefer the savory ones.The Seafood Baked Rice, , ($68 for 4-6 persons, $88 for 7-12 persons) was spectacular when presented. This is one massive pan of rice piled generously with baby abalones, scallops, mussels and prawns, as well as mushrooms (not the chinese sort). The flavor of the sauce is a mix of Portuguese and Japanese Curry, lightly spiced and savory. Save a little space for desserts. If you like variety, the Sweet's temptation, , ($20 for 4 persons) is the way to go. The dessert platter includes 4 different desserts which i felt was very reasonably priced. Start with the lightest tasting Mochi stuffed with fresh cream, chopped mangoes and strawberries, each bite is like biting into a cloud, all fluffy and dreamy. Definitely another favorite of mine.While i love salted egg yolk steamed buns, the ones at Majestic failed to impress me. Too little filling and it was lacking in the salted egg yolk richness and taste. Overall, it was a pleasing meal at Majestic Bay Restaurant. While i may not be back for the signature dishes like the Kopi Crab, i'd certainly make an effort to check out their lunch time dim sum. For $28\/pax on weekdays and $33\/pax on weekends (min 4 pax), it's value for money for a 6 course meal with 3 mains included!","1834":"Awesome dim sum. The chili crab fried bun is a must try! Reasonably priced considered that it is in the middle of a major tourist attraction.","1835":"We were visiting the flower dome and didn't feel like walking back to the Marina Bay Sands shopping center. So we gave this a try. It was really good quality. \u00c2\u00a0It's higher price consider it is located in an major attraction. The custard bun and BBQ pork bun is awesome. The overall quality is very good. It save us so much time and energy walking back and forth.","1836":"The restaurant is located at one end of a row of shophouses. The interesting thing about this restaurant is that all dishes are cooked using Josper Wood Charocal Oven and lychee wood. The restaurant serves modern European-style cuisines with an Asian touch. The walls of the restaurant is covered with colorful murals which looks great. The only thing that annoys is the loud surrounding music.Grilled Fresh Fruit Juice ($5)There is 2 choices of fruit for the juice today : pineapple or orange. I have selected pineapple for the drink. Unlike the usual sweet bright yellow fruit juice, the drink is a dirty green in color, with smoky, and savoury taste. Very interesting.Honey Lemonade ($5)Lemon, HoneyIt is a soda drink with hint of lemon flavour at the bottom. So remember to stir before drink.Tonight we are having the 3-course dinner which is available during the restaurant week and costs $35++ per person.For the small plates, we are having : Grilled Salmon Tartarewith Mixed Herbs, IKan Bilis, Spring OnionIt is different from the usual version, serving with pieces of crispy pita bread. Quite creamy and rich.Sauteed Shimeji Mushroomswith Truffle Oil, Salted Egg Becurre BlancThe dish smells great and yummy with the creamy sauce, but I could not taste the salted egg in it.This is followed by the mains : Altantic Cod 160gwith Garlic, Water Spinach Fondue, Salted Fish, Asian Herbs SauceThe fish is well cooked and tasted meaty and chucky. It goes quite well with the spicy Kang Kong.Pork Ribs 350gwith Barbecue Glaze, Roasted Baby Potatoes, House Salad, Sweet Hot SauceAlthough the rib looks dry with barely any sauce on it, the meat is very tender and flavourful with asian flavour on it. The meat tears easily off the bones. The sweet hot sauce kind of reminds one of a certain asian sauce. The greens is dressed in a light tangy dressing.Lastly for desserts, we have Chocolate Gateau & Mint Ice Creamwith Devon Cream, Strawberry Pate, Coconut FlakesI am disappointed with the version of chocolate gateau served here which looks more like a flat piece of chocolate cake with little chocolate taste in it. The stawberry pate has a quite interesting firm jelly texture. The devon cream is quite rich although it seems a bit overwhelming in taste.Grilled Pineapple & Ginger Ice Creamwith Rum, Gula Melaka, CinnamonThis dessert fares better than the former. The ginger ice cream is the star here with bites of ginger in it without being overwhelming, giving cruch to texture and hints of heat. The pineapple is sliced into paper thin ribbons, although would prefer them in smaller pieces, as it is quite hard to eat with the tea spoons given, as well as, difficult to cut them into smaller pieces.Overall the food is great. Water is refilled regularly. We are given small plates as both of us are sharing. Before the mains are served, the staff also clears the small plates, as she makes clear to us that there will not be enough space for the small plates. But interestingly when the mains are served by another staff, we are given small plates. Lastly when desserts are served, we are not given small plates again. Service seems uneven to me.","1837":"Trying out the local cuisine in Singapore while on a business trip. A colleague suggested this restaurant. Atmosphere was inviting. Menu had lots of options and upon asking a special for vegetarians was available. I had the seafood paella type dish made with prawns, scallops, chorizo and rice of course. Presentation was nice. Flavors were good but nothing special. Service was less than attentive but I'm told that's just the Singapore culture. Either way refilling my drink seems like standard service no matter what culture you visit. Not the best but not the worst meal I've had. Prices were reasonable so worth a try for a quick bite - well maybe not too quick.","1838":"I had restaurant week lunch here at $25++ and it was quite worth it.Starter I picked baby squid. About 3 pieces, covered with seasoned mesclun salad. The salad looked kinda messy. Squid was not bad. Nothing to write home about. Some of us had the beef bruschetta. Tasted like meatball sub on a piece of toast. Comfort food, nothing fancy. Toast was lightly crisp, just right.Mains I had the barramundi on mash. This was nice, fish had a really nice crispy skin on it. The salsa sauce that came with it was tasty and fresh and had roasted peppers taste. Very savoury. Tried the duck confit, a nice portion like the fish but a tad dry. The beef onglet (extra $13) that my brother had was a little on the side of chewy. Not bad but I wouldn't have ordered it for the ala carte price ($36) - go to Una instead at Rochester. They do it better for $28.Desserts - my sticky date pudding was more like just a moist cake with some light caramel drizzled on. Ice cream was quite small when it came as partly melted. There was a hint of spice in the cake but not enough for me.Drinks, we had 2 cocktails at $10 each. The Sencha mint based one was like a decent mojito, probably more of a crowd pleaser. Light My Fire that I ordered had the taste of orange bitters on it. Not bad also but a touch medicinal maybe. For the price I cannot complain.Service was pleasant and they kept our water filled. Kudos as it was a full house. I would like to come back and try their clams as well as the marrow.","1839":"Good for dinner and a fun buzzy night out, but not mindblowing. I'd rather try other places than to visit it again. We spent ~$230 for 4 people, including drinks. Cocktails (had the Light My Fire cocktail, which was light, but on a sweet side) are about $10 each, each glass of wine $9-$11.We had: - Half bone marrow ($15): Decent. The bread was nicely toasted and went well with the marrow and tomato concasse, though it was on the salty side.- Beef cubes in rendang ($15): Wasn't on the main menu but on a rotating menu of specials. Beef was nicely tender and flavorful - I personally thought it tasted better on its own rather than dipped in the sauce. The taste was more reminiscent of satay sauce than rendang.- Blue mussels ($15): The heat from the wasabi definitely shone through. The bread came in the form of fried mantous, which went very well dipped in the broth. The mantous were a tad on the small side though, and too hard. Would have preferred them fluffier.- Sharing plate of whole maine lobster, five-spice whole chicken & lamb saddle ($88): We chose mashed potatoes as our side and the black truffle and peppercorn sauces. The chicken was definitely the star of the dish - tender and flavorful. Lamb was good, but too fatty. Lobster was ok - I've had better. Would recommend getting the truffle sauce. Mashed potatoes could have done with some cheese and less butter. Very good for sharing though, and for trying a variety of meats.  - Baked pistachio melt & pandan ice cream ($10): Very photogenic, though a bit odd that the ice cream came on the side. The cake and ice cream were very fragrant, and the cake was appropriately molten, complete with a melting marshmallow on top. The pistachio taste came out pretty strongly, and the pistachio nuts sprinkled over the dessert provided good crunch.- Valrhona triple chocolate mousse ($12): This was a disappointing dish. It was more of solidified cream in a hard chocolate shell, on a bed of oreo crumbs with peanut. Except that the black sea salt went jarringly with the dessert. Good place to try but I wouldn't frequent it. Service was attentive and friendly though.","1840":"Disappointment is my motivation for writing this.It looked promising online, however once I arrived there, Britney Spears and similairly associated music was blaring in the whole place, and servers were zipping around.That was the only good part.The service attentiveness was spectacular. The servers answered all questions properly, and with my diet, cared to inquire whether some dishes had starch or cheese.We ordered the bone marrow, not bad. Pretty good, but only 5 tablespoons worth of food, the Beef steak, which, to me looked and tasted like hawker quality, over peppered, and dry, and my lobster, which, when I asked was told was 250gms of meat.It was a Crayfish, with barely 70gms of meat!The crawfish originally had tons of cheese on it, presumably to mask the bland tase of the dish, and when arrived, I told them, (also beforehand) I was allergic to dairy and carbs. They made me a fresh one without a complaint.We also ordered the scallops, which were not hot, and felt like they had been waiting for at least 10 minutes, which were ok, and chickpea bruchetta on an eggplant.This also had tons of cheese smothered on it, and asked them to make one without it.Again, the flavours were bland, and quite frankly, I could make something much better!Overall, with an orange juice and 2 cocktails, we paid $140!!!!And I was hungry!Don't bother with this place. It won't last long.","1841":"The food at FYR was pretty good. We ordered the combination steak, shrimp & chicken grill. All the portions were amazingly tasty and tender. Th restaurant is nice, quaint abs cosy. ..a good choice.","1842":"Nice burger joint in Singapore with good burgers and a good ambience. I had thir cheeseburger with fries. The bun was slightly crispy and the patty was very juicy. Recommend to give this place a try!","1843":"Good decent burgers, as a Californian gal, these burgers are very filling - with good fries to boot!Had no idea what bun they used but it was super soft!!Pretty good, with really good fries and a good selection of burgers makes it like I almost never left home!","1844":"Even though Fat Boys has been around in Singapore for quite a while, I've never been to one. But one weekday night I decided to give it a go. They offer western comfort food, like greasy burgers, artery clogging mac and cheese, chili cheese fries, milk shakes etc.They also offer customization of burgers, so you get to pick your veg, meat, egg, sauces and even buns. You could pretty much create a mega upsized burger with all forms of protein and dairy products, as long as your wallet was okay with it.Most burgers are priced around $13-$18++, you can top up $2.50++ for truffle Parmesan fries or chili cheese fries. Just top up and you won't regret it. Totally worth the extra time in the gym and money!So here was our feast for 3 pax, 2 hungry adult males and I! It was way too much food. I could sense food coma approaching as I looked at the table!1. Shrooms Burger $13++ + $2.50 for chili cheese frieslove mushrooms and the mushrooms here were quite generous. The burger bun was fluffy and slighly crispy on the edges, but as time went by, it became a soggy burger bun. The onions weren't very flavourful but rather, they were quite oily. Nonetheless, the onions brought out the flavour of the juicy mushrooms.I loved the melted cheese. It was perfect for the thick beef patty. I really liked this combination and for the price. I felt that it was pretty decent. The chili fries weren't as good as I had remembered. But the fries were crisp all the way.2. DIY Burger + $2.50 for truffle friesAt Fay Boys you get to customize your burger. For this baby, we haveHoney Oat bun $2 with1. Beef Patty $92. Bacon $2.503. Sauteed Shitake Mushroom $24. Swiss Cheese $1.805. Fried Egg $1.506. Fried Onion Rings $1.507. Garlic Aioli $0.80Total $21.10++It is a pretty pricey burger but it has everything that I want on a burger, no veggies! The burger came pretty quickly and sadly I didn't get the honour of bursting the runny egg yolk. The garlic aioli sauce was addictive and it really gave everything in the burger the same flavour.3. Chicken waffle sandwich $15.50++Another sinful main course, chicken cutlet sandwiched between cheese underneath a buttermilk waffle. The chicken cutlet was pretty thin despite it's length, but it was crispy and breaded. The waffle was quite tasteless despite it's colour. The mash potatoes were strangely cold but tasty.4. Onion RingsI loved these onion rings mainly due to the batter they used. It was fragrant and very crispy. It wasn't doughy at all. The onion rings were huge in diameter and they tasted great with the bbq sauce.5. CalamariThe calamari was abit too chewy for my liking. But the wasabi mayo was it's saving grace. Definitely preferred the onion rings over the calamari.Overall : Decent burgers with quick and friendly service. Just skip the sides.","1845":"The burger is good but the one I tried (royal cheese) had too much bbq sauce that was too sweet.Meat and bun were good so I need to try something else next time. 3-stars for now","1846":"The place is quite nice and comfy.I took a Cheeseburger which had a decent size and was tasty (meat a bit over cooked but it was still good). For the fries, \u00c2\u00a0unfortunately it's frozen fries (and you can taste it) and the sizing is small :\/","1847":"For some reason this outlet doesn't exist on the Internet at the moment. It's not on their official website yet, and it's not even listed on the name card that the cashier gave me! Did I eat here in a dream...??Regardless of whether or not I dined here in a parallel universe, this Dhoby Ghaut outlet is pretty sweet, as it's a 5 minute walk from the MRT\/Plaza Sing. Walking in, I felt like I was in a cooler version of a Johnny Rockets (after all, their playlist included fun hits like Grease Lightning.) After skimming the menu, I went with my gut and my love for the movie Pulp Fiction by ordering the Royale with Cheese. I'm not sure if I'm biased because I had only eaten 3 rice cakes earlier that day but MAN that burger was good! I asked for it to be medium, and although it was a bit too red in the centre for me, it was quite delicious and I didn't get sick from it. The fries that it came with were good, but not life changing.This is the perfect casual spot to meet friends, watch the game, and, hey, it's air conditioned. I'd be more than happy to return!","1848":"Their cordon bleu burger is so awsome. The resturant offers German beers, a vierity of Western food, and oldies music. The decoration is 50's diner style.I wanted to add a photo of my burger. I am not sure how.","1849":"This is my first time here and I'm absolutely excited. The place is really nice and the burger smells really good. I ordered the fat basterd and it was amazing! The taste was fabulous and serving was huge. I am really delighted I found this place as its gonna be one of my favorite place to go.","1850":"Wanted to love this place after seeing the menu in the window. \u00c2\u00a0The two of us returned on a Thursday evening October 9th around 8:30pm. \u00c2\u00a0Every seat was taken in this small dining room. \u00c2\u00a0We waited in the queue outside. \u00c2\u00a0After a short wait we were invited in.The staff member showed us to a 4 top in the back of the restuarant. \u00c2\u00a0After we were seated we were asked to move to a very small 2 top back in a narrow hallway.The original 4 top remained unfilled during our whole dining visit. \u00c2\u00a0We were treated to the constant flow of servers rushing by our tableWe placed our order and asked for water for the table as \u00c2\u00a0neither one of us are bar drinkers. \u00c2\u00a0We were told that the water canteen was out front. \u00c2\u00a0It truly was , just left of the front entrance door. \u00c2\u00a0 I weaved and dodged my way through service staff and customers to arrive at the water station. \u00c2\u00a0There stacked were the smallest red plastic glasses I had ever seen. \u00c2\u00a0I filled two and proceeded to walk to the back of this place dodging the same crowd as before. i WILL CALL THIS THE WATER WALK OF SHAME. \u00c2\u00a0PUNISHMENT FOR ORDERING A NON CHARGABLE BEVERAGE.The food took some time to arrive to our table and that is understandible \u00c2\u00a0as they were busy. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered a black pepper and blue cheese burger and my dining companion ordered the Holy Ceaser Chicken.The burger was coated in way too much black pepper. The Chicken Ceaser was okay. \u00c2\u00a0There is a sign at the front that says if you don't like our burgers go to the clown next door. \u00c2\u00a0I can think of alot of places in Singapore to get a GREAT burger and food at this price point. \u00c2\u00a0I will take their \u00c2\u00a0advice and go revisit one of my other favorites.The best thing going for this place is there is no service charge. \u00c2\u00a0I suspect that is what packs them in.","1851":"The best chicken rice, char siew (BBQ pork), crispy roast pork I've ever had in my life. The souly sauce chicken was smooth and seasoned perfectly - not too salty. BBQ pork and crispy pork are also perfectly done. Definitely a must have next time you're in Singapore.By the way, this place is better than the other restaurant that won the Michelin star -- you know which one I'm talking about.","1852":"Generous portions, chicken breast is smooth and juicy, and really flavourful. Vegetables and char siew are pretty good, but not really standouts. Quick, friendly service and reasonable prices. Maybe the only negative is the lack of variety on the menu (or the lack of a menu at all), but that's probably the only reason they can serve so fast.To get a table, you'll probably have to come before 630pm for dinner on weekends. There's a long queue for takeaway orders too. Overall, this is way better than Hawker Chan's (also in Toa Payoh).","1853":"Had this chicken rice at around 1pm was afraid to meet the lunch crowd but thankfully able to grab seats. The chicken is smooth and tender. For a person who hardly eats roast pork, their roast pork is pretty good. Crispy and juicy. I didn't get to eat their dumpling soup as I'm allergic to prawns but my boyfriend got to enjoy them. I can literally count the amount of prawns they put in each dumpling. (I was expecting the minced the prawns instead of putting whole prawns in)Whether I'll come again, definitely yes for a quick simple lunch.","1854":"It's different. It's rich in flavour. It's old in ways of preparation. You can actually taste how things used to be back then.This chicken rice is class. No frills, just like how they used to make'em in the old days. \u00c2\u00a0Nothing superbly spectacular about it as a whole but you can tell that it's something special.It's a slightly above average plate of chicken rice that gets you there for sure. But there's something about that taste that brings you back to olden days Singapore food. The star however does not lie in the rice or noodles or chilli, the chicken is definitely one of the softest and most moist I've ever eaten!The sauce is uber thick but a tad starchy. It had a slight herbal flavour to it which made it fragrant. This is definitely a very unique alternative to your everyday normal plate of chicken rice. I do for see myself coming back again just for that soft sweet chicken.P.S - Things are a little bit more to the sweet side than salty here I noticed.3.2 STARS","1855":"Sweet, sweet, chicken rice. The sauce is the magic in this hard to pronounce restaurant. LEE FUN NAM KEE (combination of founder's and his wife's surnames). Now don't forget that because this is where you will experience the sweetest chicken rice sauce ever. The brown sauce that comes with the soya sauce chicken is thick and starchy and so flavourful. You can mix the chicken with the chicken rice and you're set, your meal is complete. If you're not easily satisfied, there are the standard veggies that you can order as a side, the veggies - Kai Lan, comes with sinful pieces of pork lard. YUMMEH. The price of the dishes are higher than your usual chicken rice in the kopitiam but this is a semi-restaurant leh, so the price is not that bad la. The restaurant is always crowded on meal times, both weekdays and weekends. Do make your bookings beforehand.","1856":"Lee Fun Nam Kee is a reminder that there's more than one way of preparing your chicken rice. I personally like the \"normal\" Hainanese version, i.e. plain \"white\" boiled. However, this restaurant, in addition to serving it plain, also offers an awesome soy sauce version. The thick and sweet gravy is poured over the chopped chicken before serving with chicken rice. The rice is slightly oily and very fragrant (which is how chicken rice should be). It's so good that you can just eat it on its own.This restaurant is also highly recommended if you are looking for a nostalgic taste from the 1960s. The restaurant began as a food stall in the old Toa Payoh Lorong 4 food centre in 1966 before moving to its current location.","1857":"Best steamed chicken rice in Toa Payoh?","1858":"The Char Sui is savory with very nice crispy skin. The chicken with soy sauce was tender and moist. Loved it! No menu here so I didn't know what else they have but these two dishes were perfect. I will be back for more","1859":"I am a huge chicken rice fan....lee fun serves really juicy and tender chicken and sesame oil chicken, perfectly executed. The rice is also really fragrant with lotsa chicken flavor. The only problem is the quality of the rice can be variable, and I have had better rice at other chicken rice places. But overall this chicken rice joint is legit and a must try","1860":"Food is served fairly quickly for such a large restaurant and the unlimited Calamansi juice is a nice touch. \u00c2\u00a0Try the Angus rib eye and the black pepper crab, as well as the samba kang kong.","1861":"We found this restaurant on the Lonely Planet guidebook. \u00c2\u00a0Interesting restaurant with red plastic tables, chairs, bowls, chopsticks and soup spoons.We ordered the the Fish Head Soup. \u00c2\u00a0We had the Grouper. \u00c2\u00a0The fish was excellent and the broth was fantastic.The Bitter Melon with Salted was a great food find. Tasty, crispy and delicious.We also have the Hokkien mee (noodles). \u00c2\u00a0Not sure how Hokkien meeting should taste like - I'll reserve judgement when I have more experience ( Ie. eat more)The server suggested that we try their Porkchop and Spring Rolls. \u00c2\u00a0We declined since we were trying to limit our intake of deep fried food. \u00c2\u00a0I'm guessing that the 2 items we declined to order could be delicious given how delicious the Salt Egg Bitter Mellon tasted.I highly recommend Nan Hwa Chong for a novel (for non SE Asians or non Chinese) visiting Singapore.Service was fast, friendly and efficient.","1862":"Good business here... call in advance for call confirmed table in AC dining hall. 1st time here.... overall they do serve a reasonable food here. Fish soup is good, but I hope more taro in the pot.","1863":"Our list of Fish Steamboat places are limited till we explored another place here in North Bridge Road. Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner adopt the use of charcoal instead of the ususal gas can operated steamboat pot. It is said that the use of charcoal to fire up the broth gave a smoky flavour and an even heat distribution to the broth itself.Location is rather prominent as it is located at the traffic junction. However, one thing that one might be worrying if driving would be the parking spaces.Not long after we settled down, we notice the constant stream of patrons walking into the shop. Everyone who walks in were promptly attended by the server. Most who came in had already made reservation via phone call before hand and they were directed to the air conditioned corner of Nan Hwa Chong.Seeing this station as the toughest job of all standing in front of the flames ensuring that the charcoal are evenly burn and stuffing them into the every steamboat that comes out from the kitchen.Supposed to be their recommended egg dish, however we got it served with the middle part burnt. Nevertheless the texture still remains fluffy and taste ordinary with a handful of oysters.The plate of stirred fried broccoli is my kind of home cook dishes. The light taste of broccoli greens is cooked with carrots, ginger and button mushrooms with minced garlic.We had chosen the grouper fishboat. The grouper fish comes from the sea-bass family.It is low in fat and cholesterol with firm texture and mild flavour. A healthy choice that does not compromise in taste. Three other types of fish offered will be Pomfret, Song Fish Head and Snapper Fish.Grouper Fish Medium Pot - $35Ingredients include fish, vegetables, seaweed, fried taro, flat fish, white cabbage and grouper fish. Soup is rich and sweet.While the cloudy soup may be made up by the yam, unlike other places they were done by adding milk to it. If you are wondering about the familiar taste in the stock, its the generous portions of flat fish added to the soup that gave a different taste to it.Not only that the fried yam added had also elevated the soup taste.Simply love dabbing the fish meat into this sweet sour and spicy chilli.If you love traditional fish steamboat with charcoal, Nan Hwa Chong Fish-Head is a very good choice. Not only that, they do have a variety of Cze Char Dishes in the menu for selection too.","1864":"Good stuff, quite hard to find charcoal steamboats these days. Generous portion of fish, tasty with quite a lot of flesh. Soup base was really good as well, and I really liked the ingredients, especially the yam.We also tried the homemade beancurd, with chilli sauce, amazing. Really the only negative is that the drinks aren't made in-house. Service was prompt and prices decent, about $30 per pax. Will be back if I'm in the area.","1865":"Old fashioned charcoal hot pot fish soup. Easy to digest and always a favorite. The stir fry vegetables and shrimp omelette are good side dishes.","1866":"This is one of the best \"old school\" charcoal style steamboats that you HAVE to try if you enjoy fish based charcoal steamboat.They sell many other oh-so-yummy sze-char dishes too even if you don't feel like steamboat.They get VERY crowded around dinner time especially on weekends from 6pm - 10pm. They did however take over the unit beside them and have a small air-conditioned area.Parking seems to be quite the problem here though like others have mentioned so do take note about that or just park further away and be prepared to walk a bit. Oh and they do close quite late! Most of the staff seem to speak Chinese with very little english so communication may be a slight problem if you don't speak the language. Maybe to avoid grumpy staff scolding you when they're busy, come for supper when it's less crowded? Haha.. it does get pretty hectic during dinner time! However, if you're a foodie, its definitely one of the \"must try\" steamboat places to visit to take your taste palette down memory lane. :)Things I normally order and enjoy - Grouper Fish Steamboat and Salted Egg Pork Ribs!4.0 Stars","1867":"Amazing!!!It is at the corner of our hotel's street. It is packed when we got back during some late nights and also occupied the street around 6ish.Every table enjoys the steamboat (usually we tend to call it hot pot). The must-have pot is a steamed soup of fish, veggie, pickled Chinese cabbage, salted fish and seaweed. All the freshest.Singaporean cuisine is renowned for its satay, laksa, Hainanese chicken, chilli crab which all featured greasy. But hands down for this simple, pure, soul, comfort fish soup!! More than just a break from the spicy food, but truly get to taste the MSG free delicacy. The snacks are also local, stand out from the Hawcker Centres. Large portions and very reasonable price. The locals knows the best.","1868":"Pros: \u00c2\u00a0the ingredients were fresh and the soup base was tasty. \u00c2\u00a0Cons: \u00c2\u00a0service was slow and sourly, and orders were forgotten; some of the side dishes had small portion sizes and although the fish head was large, the best parts (ie, cheeks, fin area) were missing. \u00c2\u00a0For the price, it felt a bit like paying for lamb and getting mutton instead.","1869":"It's been here since 1927 and this is the 3rd generation running the place. Traditional teochew steamboat - choice of fish, fried yam pieces, ti-bo (fried fish), cabbage, etc. Yumm...an awesome bowl of fishy goodness served in a charcoal steamboat.They also have good tze-char dishes - fried pork were great, the braised intestines yummy, sambal crayfish and a variety of others.There is AC upstairs if you find it too hot. The thing that kills me here is the parking. I wish wish wish that they provide valet parking.3.5 stars for the food, 0.5 stars for tradition! The boss himself still brings up the steamboat to the table.","1870":"Dropped by for a weekend dinner last week and it didn't disappoint. When your steamboat uses charcoal, you hardly go wrong. There's something about a charcoal steamboat that you can get with an electric one or even a gas steamboat. It's probably all that traditional smoky goodness that adds a load of flavor and depth to the soup. Their other dishes are pretty happening as well. Definitely worth a go. If you're heading there, best not to drive though. Parking isn't the best around the area.","1871":"There was a discussion not too Long ago about Singapore having its own Michelin guide, whether they'd be able to fill a whole guide? Would hawker food be included? Will non-western style restaurants qualify for a star?I didn't get involved in the discussions, and I was actually in the camp of 'we're probably better off without one'. And then I came to this place. Now, you're probably not going to see anything on the menu that will blow your mind, it's variations of dishes people familiar with the 'Zhi-char' scene already know, but it's the preparation, the refine style in which its done to perfection, the way it's served etc. Ahhhh. Go try. Tell me if you agree this place deserves a star.","1872":"Finally good NY style pizza in Singapore. I am always sceptical about pizza in Asia so I tried this some reservation. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The crust was very nice and crispy. I could eat it on its own - thats a mark of a good pizza. They also did not skimp on cheese and toppings. I was really happy with that. Another surprise is the store has proper parmesan cheese and other condiments. I could eat this every day and I am so glad its only a bock away from my house.","1873":"It really tastes like authentic New York Pizza. Price is typical for Western food in Singapore. It was worth it.","1874":"Again another New York Pizza disappoint here in Singapore. But, I should not be surprise due to must New York Pizza joints here are so, so or not worth going back to. \u00c2\u00a0 Very odd crust and the whole pizza was bla. I do not even know what they call their pepperoni here or what it was. Due to it look like a chopped up big hotdog texture but, it was not hotdog so I am not sure what it was but, it did not not taste like your regular pepperoni. For some reason they season the pizza after cooking it with some type of pepper seasoning with a touch of oregano. Tell you the truth the season is not needed because it does not taste it should go with the pizza. The sauce was ok but, the sauce is better tasting then Tony's Pizza. \u00c2\u00a0 Recommend for me I will not be going back at all and that is because the pizza is bla and hidden secret pizza toppings that I do not know what they are and their cleaning standards are not up to par.","1875":"Now that Gastronomia has moved to a bigger premise (where Canele used to be), it has a larger variety of food and bigger seating space. I do miss the little corner it used to occupy but I guess change is good, and sometimes for the better. The place is now spilt into two sections. You can order hot food (well, they heat it up for you) and salad in one area with its own cashier counter, and for those who wants a quick grab and go on the pre-packed salads, pastas, wraps, desserts, bread, there is another cashier counter to handle that. This makes it neater compared to previously when you get 2 separate lines waiting to pay at one cashier point. Now that it is in the middle of the basement level (still nearer the escalator from Metro), the food display is eye-catching with plenty of salads, pastas, pizzas and cooked food. Somehow I no longer see the deli items (hams, cheese) unlike previously. It is also catching up on latest food fads with kale and beetroot on the menu. The food is generally good and it is really a good place to stop by if you have a dinner party and do not want to cook. There are salmon spinach puffs, frittata, scotch eggs, beef goulash, pulled pork, cous cous, marinated artichokes, chili con carne and more to put together a simple meal. It is also relatively to get a table with a bigger seating area though it still gets crowded during lunch time. There is a water dispenser which is a nice touch.","1876":"This is one of my favorite places to get a quick meal fixings. Under the Da Paolo group, most of the items would have an Italian base ~ salads, fresh pastas, sauces, ready cooked pizza, soups, ready made dishes and desserts, plus scones, meringues, oils, vinegar and wine. From this outlet, I usually get the spinach lasagne and spinach cannelloni which are savory and creamy. Just lovely. Blitz them in the microwave oven for a few minutes and dinner is served. The pasta sauces are equally good, likewise for the salad. I like the chili con carne from the cooked food section too.From the dessert section, I love the dark chocolate cake (think it's guanaja) which is bittersweet. The lemon pound cake slice is nice with tea and the huge scone is filling for breakfast. The cupcakes are so-so. A bit on the dry side. Pizza is not bad too. Now the latest food craze in NYC has also hit Singapore - crodo (their version of the Cronut). There are 2 versions available - cream and chocolate. They are ok, nothing fabulous that I will keep thinking about them. The cream has a lighter bite it is not weighed down with a chocolate topping (chocolate version). Instead it has sprinkled sugar over the top. The filling will ooze out when you bite into them, so be careful that it does not drip or smear your face.","1877":"It's my fav place for a quick bite on Orchard Rd. \u00c2\u00a0Their pizzas are OK, the tiramisu is fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0The venue is pretty causal, and it gets busy for lunch... check that there is a place to seat prior to ordering.","1878":"Had breakfast \u00c2\u00a0 Excellent food. Nicely prepared with fresh ingredients. Good value for money.","1879":"Great views. Decent food. Delicious dessert. From \u00c2\u00a0the top of this restaurant on the 57th floor we can see the whole \u00c2\u00a0main city of the garden by the bay and the \"trees\" \u00c2\u00a0the ocean \u00c2\u00a0filled with cargo ships, the domes that look like gigantic seashells by the shore, and then lights into the evening. For a table of 7 we started off with prawns (delicious sauce and would recommend) and grilled octopus (soft, flavorful...highly recommend). For mains we had a mix of well seasoned Bombay potatoes (garam masala, mustard, cumin...yummy) with their grilled spring chicken for 3 (just okay), smoked black cods that came in two circle shaped filets with the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms on the opposite side of the plate (fish was a cooked a bit on the oily side but still presentable and edible), sea bass \u00c2\u00a0in a fish broth and Thai basil \u00c2\u00a0for two \u00c2\u00a0(one finished it all and the other ate half). \u00c2\u00a0Special dessert was in a bed of ice and shot glasses filled with watermelon fruit on the bottom and raspberry sorbet on top. Instagram worthy. Service at the table was great. Service prior to seating was not so great because the host was trying to give us a table inside when we had requested outside we'll in advance. They tried to say that those were reserved but yet we saw no one sitting there. And then the manager was trying to tell us that of it rains that we have no table. He wasn't happy about giving us the table outside when we pressed him on giving us the outside table. Through out the evening it didn't even rain once. So many patrons came to eat and there were tables left empty where we sat. Poor execution on the management's seating arrangement.","1880":"Perched on top of the 57 floor of Marina Bay Sand hotel, this is one of the main tourist attractions for a view of Singapore magnificent skyline. Came here for cocktails but ended eating too. It came as a surprise we were able to get a table of 5 without reservation on a Saturday evening. Obviously prices were on the high side considering portion sizes. Here is a quick run down of the dishes I liked - Xinjiang lamb, WAGYU beef, Charred Kurobuta Pork chop, Spanner crabs and E-Fu noodles. Dishes I don't care for - broccoli, oysters, potato and drunken chicken. The $158 chef's premium selection of sushi and sashimi is definitely not worth ordering. Service is slow and lack attention. A bite into the food and is obvious this is more western culinary cooking \u00c2\u00a0than Asian. Almost every dishes have the same seasoning except the lamb. If you looking for Chinese food, this is definitely not the go-to place especially when you are in Singapore. Just like any other bar we have been since our arrival, the drinks are very expensive because alcohol portion in our cocktails is very minimal. There are very limited restaurant seating with view of skyline. I would recommend eating by the bar area that is actually on the balcony with better view. Overall, this is something you visit for the experience and less likely a dinning rendezvous for Chinese food.","1881":"How could you not grab a bite to eat and a cocktail while watching the amazing view on top of marina bay?? You can pay the fee to be able to go to the observation area but getting a drink at the bar costs about the same so might as well get something out of it. We made reservations and was seated right away. The decor is a modern asian, dark, and romantic atmosphere. The music is blasting but you can still hear each other. You definitely can't beat the view from the restaurant, but if you go to the adjacent lounge\/bar, there's a perfect photo op.The menu has a lot of different options so we decided to try a few things and share. We started with one of their cocktails, the botanist, it wasn't garnished with anything and didn't look like anything special. The taste was good but nothing to rave about. We ordered the grilled prawns, prawn roll and the calamari. The grilled prawns were overcooked and the sauce that was with it needed more flavor or at least have the shrimp marinated in it so it has time to soak up the flavor. The calamari was one big piece, it was lightly fried but again nothing special. The prawn roll was good but overpriced for sure. For dessert we got the rose watermelon dessert which was a cool concept and delicious. Dessert was the best part but again overpriced. I don't mind paying a high price for the meal if the meal tastes good and the experience is worth it. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to my friends who are planning to travel there, unless it was just to grab a drink at the bar.","1882":"Let's just get straight to the point. \u00c2\u00a0You really do not come here for the food or drink. \u00c2\u00a0You come here for the view. \u00c2\u00a0Set at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, Ce La Vi gives you a gorgeous view of all of Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The view up here is spectacular. \u00c2\u00a0When I came here, I was seated toward the harbor side which gave me direct view of the Gardens by the Bay below. \u00c2\u00a0There is something magical watching the sun set in Singapore and then seeing the shining lights of the city reflecting back towards you. \u00c2\u00a0My friend and I order appetizers with drinks when we dined here. \u00c2\u00a0The appetizers were light and the drinks were heavy. \u00c2\u00a0Haha. \u00c2\u00a0Okay, not really. However, this is where I had my first Singapore Sling and man I got hooked.You can make reservations for a table no more than 30-days to the date you plan to dine here. \u00c2\u00a0Tip - if you are an Amex member, use their service to handle the reservation for you.","1883":"While food is probably too \"western-ized\" and too expensive, the incredible views make up for it... so 3 starts for the food and 5 stars for the views.I arrived early so could hit the bar before dinner without oaying the $22 cover charge.I then opted for the seared foie gras which was quite good, and went for the duck afterwards. For visitors and first-timers.","1884":"Definitely would not put this restaurant under the category of world class dining. The service staff that lead us to the table barely smiled though our waitress was very friendly. The food took a while to get to our table even when there was barely anyone else at the restaurant. Portions are ant-like so don't expect to be full at the end of the meal. The fish that I had was also excessively salty. Pro-tip: if you are coming up thinking that the food will be worth it because of the view, go to the bar (that is actually on the balcony) instead and spend way less than you would at the restaurant which overlooks the bar.","1885":"Best view ever!!!!We sat on a Sunday afternoon to enjoy some drinks and try their food.We got the chicken satay, one of the appetizers. The amount of food was great, the taste was wonderful, I loved how they do it as like it was kebabs, on a stick, and the flavor was superb as we ate them with some of their signature peanut sauce that was delicious.The drink was terrible, no alcohol, and mostly ice. We paid over $20 for a glass with some juice a hint of alcohol I guess...Service wasn't as I expected. It was slow and not efficient.","1886":"Came here with a group of friends during a conference. We did not have to wait in line (with people going to the observation deck) since we had a reservation. We had to try the Singapore sling while we were here. It was very good! Not too sweet and did not taste the alcohol at all. We ordered a variety of appetizers and dishes. All were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. My favorite dish was the oysters....but it was tremendously overpriced($48 for 1\/2 dozen)We went out to the poolside bar \/ lounge and the view was amazing.","1887":"The group I was with was planning on going up to the bar and ordering a few drinks....the annoying thing was they made us pay $20 to purchase drink vouchers that we used at the bar. No idea what the purpose of this was, we were going to be spending money up there anyways....but this way we had to spend 10 minutes in a line to get the drink vouchers before we could go to the bar. Very annoying. Once we ordered 3 beers and the tab came we were blown away!!! It was $70 dollars for 3 beers!!! Yes, you read that right...70 bucks for 3 normal sized beers. I know Singapore is a pretty expensive city, but that is beyond ridiculous prices (even with a view as amazing as it was). Next time I'll skip this place, not worth the price.","1888":"I have them rated at 3 stars. From my experience, they are just understaff and the food menu selection is very minimal. That is a simple assessment, literally. Now the view on the other hand is just stunning.The experience here is very corporate and structure like. Meaning its actually a corporate event while you're trying to enjoy the view and having fun. I think the food menu could improve with a better selection and variety. Also if the staff was coordinated better as well. just my .02 cents.","1889":"Disappointed. The service was not what you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber. We were a group of 6 with a reservation made weeks ahead of time, and we had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our table. A couple of our orders were \u00c2\u00a0wrong, the food was luke warm when it finally came and only 5 of the 6 of us got our entree. The view was amazing and the potential for the food was definitely there, but execution and service fell short.","1890":"This is for the outdoor Bar section. Usually when there is pay to go up a tall building or go up for free if you eat or drink at the restaurant, the second option is better. \u00c2\u00a0HOWEVER, in this case I would suggest just paying to go up to the skydeck. \u00c2\u00a0There are several options to go up. \u00c2\u00a0Be a hotel guest. \u00c2\u00a0Pay for the skydeckEat at Ce La vi, Spago, or LavoHaving been to other Spagos and Lavo locations I'm not a fan so I crossed those off my list. \u00c2\u00a0C\u00c3\u0089 LA VI Restaurant menu did not look good but i was willing bite the bullet to go up. \u00c2\u00a0At first they said there were reservation spots open but then they changed their story so now my option is to pay 23 bucks to go up to the bar. \u00c2\u00a0You can use the 23 dollar voucher to pay for your bill so effectively the entry fee up is zero. After going up I see that the best option would have been to just pay 23 bucks for the skydeck. \u00c2\u00a0The bar is like recessed in from the skydeck. \u00c2\u00a0So imagine a half circle and the bar is in the middle while the skydeck surrounds it. \u00c2\u00a0This means that if you are on the skydeck you can walk up to the edge for unobstructed views while you get this crappy obstructed view from the bar area. \u00c2\u00a0It's like sitting outside vs inside at an oceanfront restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0The service was also HORRIBLE... like seriously, service is horrible pretty much everywhere in SG, even at the expensive spots. \u00c2\u00a0The drinks might as well have been virgin as there were basically no alcohol in them. \u00c2\u00a0You also cannot see the infinity pool from the bar area. \u00c2\u00a0There is a separate lounge portion which had a private event so we couldn't look at it. TOP TIP: the best view from the bar is actually out back past the restrooms. \u00c2\u00a0You get an unobstructed view of the gardens by the bay and of Ferris wheel.","1891":"The view was fantastic! The Beautiful Super Clean Singapore! The food was delicious but a little bit expensive! Nice music background so Romantic and Entertaining!!!","1892":"What an absolutely horrible experience! You spend a couple hundred dollars and for what?! It was so crowded that you couldn't really enjoy the views. We had vodka sodas that had no vodka in them and they cost nearly $100. That's one hundred dollars for water. We had the sashimi and sushi platter that was literally brought out one minute after we ordered it and the fish were warm and well tasted fishy not in a good way. Then we were told we needed tickets to the sky park to get to the restaurant which was not true at all. Since we prepurchased tickets we thought we would go there after since it looked like great views that weren't exactly accessible from the restaurant and with that idea the nightmarish experience continued. The guy working there sent us to the wrong elevator that didn't have the 56th floor that we needed. We finally get redirected to the correct elevator and get to the sky park entrance and the lady tells us we have to go all the way down to b1 to scan our tickets. We tell her the restaurant told us to come down since we had the QR code but the lady says no. Meanwhile there are 100+ people waiting in line to get down from the sky park and they cram you in to overfill the elevators so you can't move or breathe. Needless to say we didn't go back up there. We just wasted our money and left. Anyways, what a waste of money and a night. I had a far more enjoyable night at the lantern (Fullerton hotel) looking at the marina bay sands.","1893":"Oh man can't beat the view or the service here. Food is amazing. I had the fish dish and the fish melts in your mouth. They kept pouring the wine glass and we sat around for quite a while just enjoying the company and the view. Thank you Ce La Vi for a great experience here.","1894":"Stopped by for dinner without reservations and we were accommodated with dining at the bar. The ambience of this restaurant is awesome and the food was excellent - the portions are small, but it's as expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Try the short rib! After dinner, there are great views to be had throughout the outdoor bar area - a must see for a first visit to Singapore.","1895":"Slightly overpriced, however has a good vibe, music and atmosphere. Very fast and pleasant service. Food what got the three stars. Could of been slightly better for the price. View over the city and infinity pool worth the most. One time try.","1896":"Obviously you come here for the view, the cocktails were great! The food was trying but just didn't cut it, stick to the cocktails and the view.","1897":"I am currently at the restaurant. I am honeymooning and today is my husbands birthday. No one has been paying attention to us. \u00c2\u00a0My husband had to get them to come to our table. They brought out something that I did not even order. \u00c2\u00a0This has been a HORRIBLE experience for my honeymoon and also my husbands birthday. Beautiful view but I definitely do not recommend to eat here.","1898":"Great view of the city and right next to the infinity pool. Have lots of great food options, but if you want to munch, the fruit platter with their Thai chili is so yummy. Their fruits were so refreshing. Paired it with some drink and some French fries which was also yummy.Sadly we ran out of the Thai chili, and when we asked for more, we were told we couldn't get anymore.","1899":"Great \u00c2\u00a0place to enjoy life on 57th floor in Singapore Will edit later In a RUSH TO BOARD A CRUISE","1900":"One star automatically for being nestled atop a skyscraper next to the worlds largest infinity pool. There are amazing views from the terrace and the vibe is chilled. The line to get up to the restaurant is extremely long and packed with people who are not guests of the hotel. Guests of the hotel do not have to stand in line. I did not have food but I met friends for drink and all of the drinks were pretty awful if I'm being honest. They were over priced as well. I think one was $22 and there was absolutely noting special about it. Service also left a lot to be desired. Seems like we waited forever to get the few drinks we did order. I'd go back just for the view but I'd probably just order beer (Singapore doesn't really have good beer) next time. This would be a good place to go with friends being that you don't have to pay to get in and the atmosphere is relaxed.Not so humbly submitted,Michael C.","1901":"If you're a first timer to Singapore (SG), a view of the Skyline from Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is an absolute must! I recommend skipping that $28 fee to view the Skyline from the 57th floor observation deck; instead opt to pay the $20 to go to CE LA VIE - also on the 57th floor. It's totally worth it. You get a voucher that you can use toward any drink or food. Most specialty cocktails are about $25.00. The food is also a constant recommendation by locals.We went just before dusk; the Skyline view was absolutely stunning. No trip to SG is complete without a trip to MBS for the breathtaking views. We could've stayed here all night gauging across the beautiful Skyline. \u00c2\u00a0However, shopping the 22 shopping malls on Orchard Rd. Wasn't enough, I had to endulge inside at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. That two level CHANEL Store was calling my name, and I knew I would regret not picking up some macarons and tea from TWS.","1902":"Love this place live Dj me and my wife enjoyed every single Sec , they don't stop partying till 4 am . The view from this place is breathless at night time .","1903":"As a visitor to Singapore, I was torn because I knew coming here would be a tourist trap. But...I couldn't resist!We made a reservation for dinner on a Wednesday night and got seated pretty quickly. The soft breeze as we looked into the nightscape was nice, I'm not gonna lie. The food was subpar. Steak was cooked to correct temperature but the overall dish lacked balance. Sides were overpriced (ordered the potatoes and rice) and those fell flat too.Our water glasses were never refilled. There's a shortage of wait staff to adequately service their respective areas but management knows people will still come even with poor customer service. After all, it is a tourist trap.One thing I did resist was ordering a drink. I'm sure I didn't miss out on much!","1904":"1 - You will wait 8 years for your food. You will ask for it repeatedly by overwhelmed staff running by you and it still won't come.2 - It will come out hastily and taste just OK.3 - You won't be able to afford your rent when you leave.You're better off just getting drinks and checking out the view and the pool. Love the roof. This restaurant is a waste.Too bad. It's pretty.","1905":"So I was both disappointed and pleasantly surprised by Ce La Vi - yes, at the same time. First off, when I made a reservation for dinner the website made it look like the tables were private from the bar area where anyone can walk-in but instead we were seated in an area that was attached to the bar with people on both sides of us. It was marked off with some potted plants and red velvety type ropes but it was definitely not private and you are still pretty much in the bar. To their bonus, they do a good job of keeping the bar patrons out of the dining area as several tried to enter but it is a little disruptive being right next to the bar. I was pleasantly surprised by 1) the view which was absolutely stellar. Even better than the viewing deck below as it's completely unobstructed. We were just in awe at how gorgeous it was, and 2) the food. Yes, I had somewhat of low expectations of the food as when a place has some sort of gimmick (i.e. view) the food isn't always their focal point. However, the food here was really impressive. The standouts were the foie gras - prepared perfectly seared and topped with yuzu jelly pomegranate reduction (heaven!) and the roasted lemongrass chicken with eggplant, zucchini, & a kaffir lime green chili sauce. Ce La Vi is definitely worth a visit if you are staying in Singapore or at Marina Bay Sands. It is a little pricey but very worth it as the food was delicious and the views are second to none - just don't expect a private evening. ;)","1906":"Food is expensive and just below average. I don't mind paying top $ for great food but my experience did not impress me. We ordered two appetizers - fish ceviche and wagyu tartar. Plates came with a tiny bit of food without any taste. For main entrees we had cod - just average. Dessert came fussy with nitro on a board.. mango cheesecake that also disappointed us. 4 out of 10 stars at best and extremely expensive. View is ok.. you will be better off going to the bar than paying so much for below average food on this restaurant.","1907":"If you are in Singapore for the first time, it is worth it to view the skyline from the top of Marina Bay Sands. \u00c2\u00a0You have to pay for the view, so why not pay and receive a voucher to use towards drinks at the top! \u00c2\u00a0If you need some food, why not make reservations and also dine at the top. The modern Asian influenced menu was surprisingly tasty. \u00c2\u00a0We had a large group so had a set menu. \u00c2\u00a0Everyone in our group commented on how tasty the dishes were. \u00c2\u00a0The wine selection was also decent, as were the creative cocktails. \u00c2\u00a0Every dish was packed full of amazing flavor. \u00c2\u00a0The service was incredible. \u00c2\u00a0The views were breathtaking. \u00c2\u00a0The views from here definitely beat the Singapore Flyer. \u00c2\u00a0The sunset from the top was jaw dropping. \u00c2\u00a0There is nothing like the twinkling night lights of the Singapore skyline.","1908":"One of the only ways you can get up to the top of Marina Bay Sands without being a guest. \u00c2\u00a0$20 gets you up there and it's also a $20 voucher for you to use, so it's not exactly a \"free drink\" because they are \"awesome view priced\" but you can enjoy some stunning views from this iconic Singapore landmark. \u00c2\u00a0Just make sure to get there at off peak times so you can get a seat!","1909":"Don't get me wrong . The view was amazing and the drinks were pretty good. But the food was way over priced. \u00c2\u00a0The portions were pretty small. The service was pretty good which is really the only redeeming quality. They force you to buy a $20 voucher so to speak that can be redeemed towards drinks or food, but let's face it, everything on the menu is over $20.","1910":"This place is also a club. It used to be called Ku De Ta. It has a a really good vibe and I must say I love it. There is a night club nearby and this place classifies as a pre bar or club because it closed at 11pm. They serve some pretty nice drinks with a good view. I wish they did not have to close early. Singapore has a good night life and this place rally seals the deal. I usually drive up in the bottom floor and pay the parking fare before coming here. If you want to go somewhere else after 11pm then that is the best thing to do. \u00c2\u00a0They have a live DJ that plays anything from familiar song remixes to total EDM. You will not regret this place. There is a great bird of the South side from the premisesDrawback: hope you like long elevator rides because you will need it to come here.","1911":"This place is rather insane in both ways. First it is funny that it rather pricy. Second I think it \u00c2\u00a0is good especially if you are at the Marina Bay Sands. Last I got to love the view. It is all one of a kind in the world.","1912":"Food is good also great wine list. However the service is by far the worst I have ever experienced. Had a 21:30 reservation, was seated then 40 minutes went by before anyone took my drink or food order. I had to find a waiter to take my order. I was then told that I couldn't order the set menu because it was too late the cut off was at 22:00 it was 22:10. They eventually gave in and let me order. When each course came the waiter just quickly set it down and walked away, with no explanation of what it was. The bill comes and I charged it to my room, they needed the room key for verification. Waiter walks away and never comes back. I finally walked over to waiter station asking for my room key back. They claimed they gave it back which they did not, turns out they lost. Took them 35 minutes to find it. The dinner took about 2.5 hours with most of the time wasted waiting on service. For the amount of money you spend at this place the service was completely unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.","1913":"Amazing views of Singapore's skyline, great service! \u00c2\u00a0Enjoyed the wine parings with each segment of my meal. Definitely worth splurging on a great tasting meal. RSVP early if you want the prime dinner time slots.","1914":"If you're in the mood to check out the city view at night while being on a roof top bar\/restaurant, this is a pretty decent place to swing by.Prior to entering this bar, one must observe the strict dress code (aka smart casual) for evenings. My friends and I were out all day being tourists and didn't realize that this place had a dress code. Thankfully, we were able to get in with our comfy gear on (tennis shoes, jeans, regular tops\/jersey) since it was complimentary Ladies Night and that we all happened to be girls. However, we did get quite the stare down from the hostess and security that made us feel quite uncomfortable. Despite us being a bit under dressed, we made the trek up to the roof top bar. Unfortunately, the observatory deck was closed to the public but you could still wander around the bar area and see the city through various spots. Tried to take some pictures but there was just too many people clustered around the areas where you could peek out to see the view. As for the bar itself, it took a really long time to even put in an order (given that this was a Wednesday night) so my friends and I just left. Throughout our experience, we kept getting stopped by the staff to ask if we were going to drink and the pressure to buy something is pretty strong here.Overall, not quite worth the time to visit this place if you're only here to see the city view.","1915":"Besides the location and view this restaurant underwhelming. Food is just okay and service is lacking.","1916":"Decided to go here for lunch and it was overall disappointing. Food was mediocre at best and service was slow. They mixed up my steak with fish and had to wait even longer. I thought the price would be justified by amazing food and service, but I was sadly mistaken. Just take in the view and go to the bar for a drink.","1917":"For a nice restaurant at the top of the Marina Bay Sands, I expected better. The only thing it has going for it is the location and the view. My party didn't get to sit outside for the view, but we were able to walk around outside and check it out. The view was amazing, with all the lights of Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay; that's undeniable.The service was terrible. The servers were nice, but the restaurant felt severely understaffed. It took forever to flag down anyone. One of the girls in my party had a slight cough and needed water, but it took over 15 minutes and us asking several times before we actually got the water. It also took a while to order; instead of the waiter coming to take our order, we had to ask to order. The food itself was decent but definitely expensive for what it was. That was expected though, since I assume we're paying partly for the view. I'd suggest to just come up here for drinks rather than a full meal.","1918":"The venue is situated at Marina Bay Sands. Definitely a better bang for the buck if you're looking to get the same views as the observation deck, but be prepared for exorbitantly priced drinks and snacks. In addition, I would highly recommend going on a day when the weather is clear as they close the outdoor part of the bar when the weather is rainy or stormy. Overall, a beautiful spot just somewhat overpriced for what you get.","1919":"Very pricy but it was worth it because we were seated at an outer table. I'm not so sure it would've been worth it for an inner one. Ben and Rita were outstanding. Attentive but not intrusive. They were especially helpful with information about our stay in Singapore. I don't know if this is always the case, we were allowed to go by the lounge part after eating and take pictures at a glass partition(half wall) where you get the cityscape view and infinity pool. It was jaw dropping at night. Because of being at an outer table and being able to take pictures of pool and city it was well worth the money. But since they won't guarantee an outer table...? This is actually the highlight of our trip so far. \u00c2\u00a0We pre budgeted by looking at menu online beforehand and didn't order appetizer or drinks and paid $300 Singapore dollar. We had two entrees, a shared side, and the medium dessert sampler. Food was YUMMY!","1920":"CE LA VI offers incredible views of Singapore whilst wining and dining. Making reservations was a simple phone call away, and getting there is quite easy. I mean, you can't really miss the Marina Bay Sands hotel!Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. This gave us the chance to check out the attached bar\/club. This was where we got the best views available to restaurant patrons. (There is an even better observation deck, but that's reserved for hotel guests only.)We also got drinks while we waited as well. As other reviews state, everything here is overpriced, but it comes with the territory so set your expectations (and budget) accordingly. The only real complaint from our visit is that the bar staff got confused and tried to charge me twice for the drinks. It was resolved quickly, just in time for us to be seated.We were comfortably seated outdoors on an elevated and covered area. This was probably for the best as other tourists and visitors crowd the perimeter tables to try and get the best photos of the skyline - something you don't want to deal with when you're trying to enjoy your meal.Service was attentive, although it could've been a little quicker. Food, much like the drinks, was overpriced, but still pretty good. I expected to be blown away, but don't quite remember any exceptional bites.Overall, it was a good meal and a good experience. Just be sure to adjust your expectations, consider the experience and value as a whole, and you'll have a great time.","1921":"A million dollar view. Some great music. Yes the drinks are super expensive but its well worth the premium just because of the view (My guinness was 20 SGD!) Go on a weekday night if you want a table (standing only unless you are a resident at the MBS) otherwise you will be forced to drink your expensive alcohol sitting inside which is not worth it.","1922":"As you've probably guessed, you pay for the view. Purchase the $20 entrance fee on the ground floor, and you can redeem it for drinks at C\u00c3\u0089 LA VIE (if you opt for the observation deck, which apparently has a 360\u00c2\u00b0 view, you pay more and can't put your payment towards drinks. The observation deck was closed the day of my visit).The bar was peppered with tourists and their cameras that afternoon, but since we weren't pretending to go for the drinks, that was okay. We snapped photos of the bay along with everyone else and slowly sipped our drinks (the cocktails pack a punch--I had the Penicillin, a whiskey concoction). We weren't tempted to order food (though the pizza served on a chopping board did smell appetizing), afraid it would look better than it tasted and wouldn't be worth the price.Bottom line: if you're new in town, pop here for a leisurely afternoon drink and enjoy the view.","1923":"A but pricey but great for a honeymoon ar a special occasion. You should probably try the Mushroom Dumplings and a fish dish with a really delicious broth (I can't remember the name), together with the chilli corn and the crushed potatoes. They are the starts of the show. The desert platter (L) also not to be missed! However, some dishes were underperforming, like the Bombay Potatoes, which were sort of bland, \u00c2\u00a0and the Korean BBQ Chicken, which was a tad too sweet. That's why 4 stars and not 5. Beautiful plating and great ambience especially during special times like F1, NDP or NYE. If you're up for the price, I strongly recommend this place for you.","1924":"Definitely come for the experience of it all (fantastic view high above city) and shishi Asian style food. \u00c2\u00a0Not don't get me wrong, it was tasty and decent food but not particularly memorable for the price.I would not return unless I was bringing someone who has never experienced it before.","1925":"Ok - view very good. \u00c2\u00a0The whole reserved tables thing was completely over rated. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Sat at a table that was 'reserved' and was told at 10pm must move due to 'people coming in'. \u00c2\u00a0 10pm came and no one was coming in but needed to move. \u00c2\u00a0 When asked why - 'because'. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Next time be less rude after I buy one drink and a bottle of water for $40SGD. \u00c2\u00a0 Trust me - this place is not worth your attitude. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Smell you later. .","1926":"We hit up CE LA VI for ladies night on Wednesday since its free cover for the ladies not realizing cover doesn't start until 9 in general and we got there at 8 so that really didn't matter. \u00c2\u00a0Loud club like bars aren't totally my scene, so it was defiantly a little loud for my taste but at least outside you can kind of have a conversation with the person next to you. \u00c2\u00a0The outside are was small which I was pre-warned about but it was smaller than I expected even with the warning. \u00c2\u00a0Drinks were pricey but that was expected. \u00c2\u00a0The view was very night but the one at 1-Altitude is much better and the outdoor area is way more spacious.","1927":"Lovely bar to have a drink and enjoy the view of Singapore from the 57th floor. The Sky bar was crowded and hence the service was a little slow. The drinks and pizza was great. A great place to relax with a drink and enjoy the view. Ce La Vi was less crowded with great DJ","1928":"So, five stars for the cocktails which are excellent. In particular as a night spot to enjoy views of the city before dropping into the club or heading somewhere else for very late night stuff (place closes at 2).3 stars for the food, which is okay but definitely overpriced (I guess they charge for the location, which is kind of understandable).In general I would come here for cocktails only.","1929":"Bad service. Waiter stretched too thin. Poured sparkling in my still, forgot my rice, steak was too rare, calamari too salty. For having a 4 figure bill, wasn't up to par. The view was nice.","1930":"This place was amazing! The food is good and the service is wonderful but the View is breathtaking!!! You definitely want to have a drink at the Sky bar and take a look at the infinity pool.","1931":"KU DE TA is the name of the bar\/lounge at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The hotel allows you to go up to KU DE TA without a fee (assuming that you will purchase drinks) \u00c2\u00a0to enjoy the view. KU DE TA is directly adjacent to the infinity pool, so you get amazing views looking into the city while youre at the bar. The service, however, is terrible. It may have been so bad at the particular time I went because there was a private party, and many of the servers looked occupied with that. We sat ourselves, got our own menus and had to go to the bar to order. The menus looked old and the pages were creased and unprofessional looking, the drinks were expensive and we had to ask 3 times for glasses of water. In conclusion, you pay for the awesome views. That's it. You don't pay for nice menus or impeccable service. I was disappointed to say the least. I would even venture to say that if I go again to see the view and the service is just as terrible, I'll take my photos and leave without getting a drink. Ku De Ta, you get 1 star for the view, 1 star for the drink selection ($40 sangria for 2 people) and wasabi chips.","1932":"The view is breathtaking, especially in the late afternoon\/early evening. Otherwise, this is your typical trap for tourists and western expats: so-so food, high prices, and a culture that is based on profit maximisation, rather than customer service. You come here once for the experience of being so high up, or to impress some guests, but you won't come back - certainly not for the food.","1933":"Spectacular views of the entire city and harbour. Access to the rooftop pool is limited for hotel guests. The 30 Hong Kong Dollar entrance fee goes towards drinks or food purchases. The service was slow and not too friendly, however the main reason to be up here is the spectacular view and not necessary a good dining or drinking experience. Definitely recommend to everyone to have a quick drink up here.","1934":"I have the complete opposite view of the previous reviewer regarding food vs. drinks \u00c2\u00a0-- \u00c2\u00a0my cocktails were ok, but the food was delicious. But we agree on the view. It was spectacular in my view, and it is well worth the price. I am surprised it is rated so low in yelp. It is one of the best restaurants I have been to this summer, and I had been eating out practically all summer.","1935":"This is in the best location! It provides SHADE for when you're burning on fire on top of the observation deck. Still offers great views of Singapore and has good drinks! Little pricey but it's what you'd expect with the venue.","1936":"We visited Ku De Ta last weekend mainly for the views. My husband had been once before with a colleague and insisted we check it out. He informed us that we'd have to pay to get to the deck for the views and that it was worth it to go up to eat. He called the night before to reserve a covered table on the patio and we got an excellent view from the corner of the deck. We both ordered the brunch ($98 each), which included oysters, salmon sashimi, tuna tataki, prawn salad with glass noodle, cucumber salad, prawn and vegetable tempura, and miso soup in addition to a main course selection and juice, coffee, tea and soft drinks. I ordered the donburi (pork belly, mix vegetables with chili garlic, teriyaki). I was very pleased with all of the food, but will say it was definitely a Paleo cheat meal. I did my best to avoid the tempura, rice and soy-based food, but know that it was impossible to avoid completely. The gentleman who seated us was very nice, but other than that, the service was lack luster and one woman was borderline rude.I thought it was a unique experience with a really gorgeous view of Singapore, and the people watching was awesome. This is not a place that we will frequent because on top of the expensive spread, parking wasn't fun and neither was navigating the mall to get there. But...If we have guests in town, this will be a must, along with dinner at the Equinox restaurant on the 70th floor of the Swissotel.","1937":"A trip to Singapore (first timer) would not be complete without a trip up to the top of Marina Bay Sands. \u00c2\u00a0Yes, it is true that non-hotel guests do not have access to the infinity pool, because otherwise I would totally be there! \u00c2\u00a0However, you can still enjoy the beautiful scenery up top. \u00c2\u00a0There is a SG$20 cover charge to go up to the restaurant\/bar\/lounge, but that SG$20 can be added towards your bill. \u00c2\u00a0It really is a lovely place to grab a drink and enjoy the view. \u00c2\u00a0I would suggest going at sunset to see the colors change in the sky and on the skyline. The menu seemed very mediocre and basic, so I would go elsewhere for food. \u00c2\u00a0They have a lovely cocktail menu, so I just stuck to that :)","1938":"Wow. If you're thinking of spending $25 for the Skypark observation deck, don't be stupid. Buy yourself an amazing cocktail at Ku de Ta. The best time is around 6:30 pm to catch the sunset. Cocktails are over $20 but at least they are good. The food which is Asian fusion with a heavy emphasis on Japanese is equally pricey but high quality and delicious. Service is impeccable. All dishes are shared family style. Can you buy yourself about 5 meals in Singapore for the price of one cocktail here? Sure you can and I normally have an aversion against grotesquely overpriced shi-shi places but the breathtaking view is one that you'll remember a lifetime.","1939":"We went to CE LA VI because it's cheaper to get a cocktail here than to pay the entrance fee to the observation deck. By cheaper it is still pretty pricy, I believe it is about $15 USD\/drink. The food was just okay, and honestly I was not impressed by the view either. Service was decent and friendly enough. Come here if you want to check it off your list (if it's on there), but don't bother if it is not.","1940":"Obviously expensive, but that's fine for the View. Very rude an non-professional service. Not coming back.","1941":"I went here twice - once for the club and returned the next night to try the restaurant! Both experiences were great - especially the food, the view and the drinks! it's vegetarian friendly so that made it all the more special!They do have a minimum required spend for dinner but it still seemed a much better deal than paying for the skydeck. Honestly, it was also just worth it because the experience wasn't touristy or kitschy, it was actually fun and unique!","1942":"Only reason they are getting a star is he view other than that I would never dine there! Food was horribleService was worst than food as they don't change the plates after appetizers Serving spoons were not provided! We had to wait for at-least 10 mins to acknowledge us then another 5 to bring darn serving spoon! Guess what food was too cold! Go there for experience not food or service!!!","1943":"You really can't ask for anything better in a WOWZA place to bring guests. Gorgeous, magical view of Singapore, lots of sharing dishes (I really really love sharing food) and stunning food. It's such a treat getting to eat up here. This is another one of those 'if you're cold we're gonna wrap you up in a shaw' kind of places. Literally the only reason to give it a 4 instead of a 5 is service in consistencies but all in all its a killer place!My favourite on the menu would definitely have to be the black miso cod, however they seem to change their menu quite frequently, which I like, but means you have to check before you order because that 'beef dish you liked last time' may not be the same one anymore! I would 100% ask for the staffs recommendation (which I guess you should do in most places anyway!) and come with lots of people so you can share lots of things!Wonderful celebratory dinner venue!","1944":"Visited this bar primarily for the views of the city. \u00c2\u00a0We got very lucky and actually got 2 free drinks since there was some sort of competition going on. \u00c2\u00a0I was really pumped as the drinks here are pricey. \u00c2\u00a0I would recommend checking this place out for one drink and to jockey for elbow room at the railing for a view of the city. \u00c2\u00a0Beyond a tourist attraction this bar doesn't really have much else to offer. \u00c2\u00a0 The actual bar itself is pretty small at the bar tenders got overwhelmed quickly. \u00c2\u00a0Service was mediocre.The crowd was mostly 40+. \u00c2\u00a0Check this place out for one drink then Head elsewhere.","1945":"Came by to check out the view from the Marina Bay Sands resort. Upon arrival, the host at the street level gives you a card to access the bar at the 57th level that restricts access to the restaurant and the resort pool.Drinks at the bar are ~S$25 each. The views are outstanding and the staff was cordial.They did provide some spicy Pringles-like chips while enjoying the beverage.","1946":"$20 a head to go up there but they won't let you take a friggin photo of the skyline without paying another $23. Dropped $300 on a mediocre dinner and got shafted by the guy guarding the view. F this place.","1947":"We came here for dinner food is decent but service is not up the mark you would expect from a good restaurant! There were either too many servers as soon as we were seated and then none for long periods!Ordered a beer 10mins later ordered our Main meal.. the beer came well after we had finished mains!!","1948":"After a 3-month booking, we got into the restaurant, and I have to say, the view is stunning. That is essentially the best part. Had the beef wagyu as a starter, and food quality aside, that was disappointing. It was very small, but cost me $34. Had lamb chops as a main; was not much better. Again, the portion was very small for that price. However, the warm chocolate cake was excellent. I would only recommend this restaurant if you're keen on the view!","1949":"We visited the bar on a Sunday afternoon - no cover charge, just buy a couple of beers. The place is definitely tourist spot but the view is insane, and the feeling sitting up there on the edge, pool full of swimmers next door, 57 stories up, ice cold beer in hand on a nice day, would be tough to replicate. It's one of those must-see things with a monopoly, like a cable car, but totally worth it.","1950":"The only reason I give this three stars is for the view. \u00c2\u00a0Drinks are outrageously expensive and very weak. \u00c2\u00a0They do have a good list of liquor, a few beer and wine choices but nothing that I would specifically go up there for.Staff is not very good at all. \u00c2\u00a0Did not understand and even argued with us when we asked to split our check. \u00c2\u00a0Totally they did not listen to what we asked to do, then got angry when we told the server she did not listen to us. \u00c2\u00a0Beware of this. \u00c2\u00a0Go with cash.Go for one drink and the view, then leave.","1951":"Great location and view. Slow service. Average food. Tamarind braised short rib was good, Garupa ( fish) was bland.","1952":"Ce la vie, french word for that's life. Okay so let start out with the location, this club is located at marina bay sands tower 3, there be a reception right at the lobby where you get checked in and you will receive a card if your on guestlist to be given to another reception counter at 57 floor. If you felt like you had a hard day of work and your urban scape kinda person, the view up there is amazing at night no doubt. What makes it amazing it is because its not fully glass caged like your in a fish tank. For members they have sofas and rectangle tables to kick back and relax on, but if your not there are plenty of standing tables near the entrance where you can enjoy your favorite drink, view and music.Interior, there nothing much to describe really, when you walk into the club its pretty dim setting, so there nothing fancy much you can see.. Pretty standard sofas by the side of the dance floor for you people who feeling rich, you can ball all you want. Its not really big, sits max 4 each side. The feeling you get is a very beach setting in a sheltered environment but its actually a open air club. You can't really feel the air con if you're vividly dancing around like a bunny to impress some girls.Dance floorMy favourite segment, they have a really huge space for you to glide around which i really love. But it get crowded too early and especially the crowd there are mostly expats in the 30s and we asian are small built, best part we are dancers so we dont need a football field to bust a move.ServiceThe servers are efficient, polite and professional. Although the orders took awhile to reach it makes up for the service we had. The only set back we had was the door bitches, i believe they can handle the situation better by being more approachable, smiley and not by living your stage name as a door bitch. We had some issues with the guestlist as they miscalculated or some information was not communicated properly but it was all good in the end.Conclusion It is a definete place to checkout, chill have a beer or whatever you feel like.. Or dance till you drop retarded.","1953":"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for our one night in Singapore, so we figured we should try one of the restaurants at the hotel. \u00c2\u00a0We were debating to go there for dinner or for lunch, but we wanted to venture out of the hotel that night so we ended up going there for lunch the next day. Of course the views are impeccable since it i the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, but the food was average and over-priced. \u00c2\u00a0Both my husband and I were excited about the miso black cod they had on the menu, but it turned out to be such a small portion and the fish was not cooked well. I think we paid almost $200+ for lunch for 4 of us and weren't even drinking. \u00c2\u00a0We did a have a few drinks at their bar the night before, and now that I recall those were very pricey as well- guess you are paying for the views!","1954":"Definitely very overpriced and the service was nothing great, i had to call out for the bartender after 20 min of waiting by the bar. The drinks tasted delicious and the view is to die for! Gets super windy sometimes but over all a great roof top bar if you are in singapore. I spent $150 here for 4 drinks.","1955":"Came to the 56 floor viewing deck and popped up to grab a cocktail and managed to get a seat. Cocktails around S$24 which I thought was reasonable, service a bit patchy due to new staff being on.Worth it for the views and it was lovely on a Sunday afternoon. Great DJ - bit of soul, classics and dance so a cool brunch vibe and I could have stayed longer. Dress code then is casual but post 5.30pm, formal dress (no shorts for men) is stated on signs at the bar. Cocktail was good - Royal Smile I think, it was slightly sour but refreshing and just what was required. I would go back on my next visit.","1956":"I had meant to Ive this place 3 stars in the beginning. The views are spectacular here, however food or just not that great. At least compared to the street food options that are in Singapore. Either way, if it's view you're looking for and aren't staying at marina bay sands, then it might be worth the small price to pay compared to the rooms.","1957":"This is getting 3 stars at best. Came here because we felt the need to have a nice dinner during our stay at Marina Bay Sands. After having food court dim sum at Sands malls most of the time, we felt like a nice dinner at $80 minimum per person would not disappoint. We made reservations and upon arriving at the appropriate time we were taken right up. Once upstairs we were taken to a table that seated 6, there were only two of us, so we felt awkward and told the host staff we would wait for a smaller table.The view from the bar was great and the cocktail selection was extensive, but after receiving our cocktails suggested by the creepy manager (who we thought was buying our cocktails, but didn't) was unimpressive. Lacked flavor and balance you look for in a pricy cocktail ($26 SS).From there we were seated at yet another 6 person table, same as before but in the corner (less awkward) so we decided to stay. Plus 30 more minutes had gone by and we were now tired and hungry! We ordered a side of Forrest mushrooms, the duck, and prawns.Everything came out separately, not sure if this was how it was suppose to be, but it did. Then the duck came, and it was chewy and not at all what we thought. We barely took 3 bites it was that bad. The prawns were really great, and so were the forrest mushrooms, but we were still hungry and just under our $80 per person spend. So we order fried rice to get us to our minimum. It was fried rice, you can't really screw that up. We were glad we ate a \"nice\" dinner at our hotel, but in retrospect should have saved our money and eaten at the marina bay sands mall food court. Ha!","1958":"Maybe it's because I'm from San Francisco where there are plenty of bars and clubs around that let you in for free...but I found Ku De Ta's $50 cover charge to be a bit ridiculous! \u00c2\u00a0Yes, even with the inclusion of one well drink. \u00c2\u00a0MBS is gorgeous, the lounge is beautiful, and the views stunning. \u00c2\u00a0But the crowd on a Friday night? \u00c2\u00a0 A mishmash of expats my parents' age, a few locals, and some tourists. \u00c2\u00a0Quite empty, and far from the cool, exclusive vibe they're trying to go for with that cover charge. \u00c2\u00a0Also...the music? \u00c2\u00a0Not good. \u00c2\u00a0Fog machine? \u00c2\u00a0Embarrassing. \u00c2\u00a0But the views (again)? \u00c2\u00a0Incredible. \u00c2\u00a0While it wasn't my scene, I still had fun with my cousin and friend and appreciated being taken up there. \u00c2\u00a0This might be something everyone has to do once while in Singapore, but once enough is plenty.","1959":"Overview - Visited Ku De Ta for a cocktail in October 2014. It is an indoor and outdoor space on the roof of Marina Bay Sands hotel, which has a restaurant, bar and nightclub. Pros:1) Great panoramic view of Singapore. 2) Cocktails were excellent and the bar puts a unique twist on some of the classics (ex. Adding charred orange and cherry to an old fashioned). Cons:1) After 6pm, they enforce a dress code, which requires pants for men (in a roasting Singaporean climate!)2) We were there around lunch time on a not-busy week day and service was slow.","1960":"Slightly pricey, but I would say worth the view. It's a great view of the Singapore skyline. You would be able to catch a glimpse of the world's highest infinity pool overlooking Singapore too! I wouldn't come here for a regular weekend, but it's a great place to bring some friends when they're visiting in town.","1961":"Surprisingly small indoor area. Amazing outdoor patio\/deck with the hands down best view of the bay overlooking the downtown financial district and beyond. It is a must go at least one time if you are into the whole club lounge scene. I was quite surprised by how awesome the bottle service was. Bracing myself for a huge bill it didn't end up being so bad at the end. The attendants are very attentive to keeping up with out tables. The pricing structure is focused on people getting bottles instead of by the drink cocktails. Just partied and drank here. I didn't even know they had food. Perhaps on my next trip.","1962":"I read all the reviews before walking over here from the Pan Pacific. Most of the are spot on but I think it depends on your own experience.First, I made reservations 2 hours before. I was surprised it was that easy but it was a Wed night. To get to the restaurant you must wait in line at Tower 3. If you have a reservation or going to the bar they will give you a red entry ticket. The elevator only goes to the top so there is no stopping. When you get out there are numerous people around to ensure you get to where your going. But most important ensure you do not get access to where you're not supposed to.First, the wait staff is out of this world. Never had an empty glass, always attentive, napkin in lap 3 times, amazing! \u00c2\u00a0The staff gets 2 stars alone. Second, the food. Eh. I ordered the Salmon and it was just \"ok\". This place is ala carte so when ordering Salmon, you only get Salmon. I had to order a bowl of rice just to make sure I felt like I was eating something. Half star for food only because I the Salmon was that of a chain restaurant. My salmon, a bowl of rice and water and it was over $S100. So yes, it's expensive.The views from this side of the rooftop bar is not that great. You have to go to the Lounge for the stunning views. Read my review on that as well. So other than being expensive for what you get I say 2 stars for the service, 1\/2 star for the food and a half star for the location.","1963":"The restaurant setting, food and service is exceptional!The minimum spend is very reasonable for the quality and vibe, which is upscale, mix tourist, mix locals and smart (vs casual) and the sharing plate style allows you to sample many of the dishes. \u00c2\u00a0The cocktails are delicious and the wine menu extensive.I can't wait to return!","1964":"I know, I know, this is the biggest tourist trap in Singapore, but you know what it's awesome!It's like going up the Empire State Building in New York, you get an incredible view of the city and beyond the island to surrounding islands - very very cool.No charge to get up there, but you'll pay big bucks for drinks (beers around $20 and cocktails $22+).This was definitely a highlight of the holiday. Highly recommend anyone heading to Singapore to go for just one drink and soak up the incredible view.","1965":"Although recommended by friends, very disappointed with the food. Very expensive, with small taste-less portions. Go for a drink( also expensive) and the view, eat somewhere else.","1966":"This review is for the bar\/lounge at night. \u00c2\u00a0Luckily we were guests of the hotel so we got in with our own entry access. \u00c2\u00a0We didn't have to wait in the long line I saw in the hotel lobby. \u00c2\u00a0We get up there and I expected it to be busy, but not sardine packed. \u00c2\u00a0Couldn't get around, let alone get to the edge to see the view at night. \u00c2\u00a0It was stepping on toes and shoulder to shoulder packed. \u00c2\u00a0This was a Wednesday night mind you, not a Friday or Saturday night!It took us almost half an hour just to get drinks at the outside bar. \u00c2\u00a0The bartenders were rude and ignored us when we tried to get their attention. Everyone had a difficult time just getting drinks. \u00c2\u00a0When we finally got our drinks, they were watered down and gross. \u00c2\u00a0I didn't get gin and tonic, I think I just got tonic minus the carbonation. \u00c2\u00a0When we converted the bill, we realized we paid about $22 per drink. The crowed was mixed ethnicity, beautiful young people who work in the city, business guys in button downs, models, a few tourists, and older people (I'm guessing they're guests of the hotel and got in just like we did).We got on the dance floor for about 10mins and it was just too crowded. \u00c2\u00a0The music was pumping and the DJ was really good, but the space was just too small. \u00c2\u00a0The bar takes up about 1\/10th of the entire rooftop at the top of the Marina Bay sands hotel. \u00c2\u00a0The next day when we went to the pool, we saw just how small it was. \u00c2\u00a0I guess there's no limit on the number of people to cram into an outdoor bar with a view.","1967":"This review is strictly for bar\/lounge. The view is absolutely stunning. I was brought here by a friend for a round of drinks and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed. The crowd is pretty mixed between expats and tourists with a splash of locals lol. Drinks are pricey but thats understandable given the view they offer. The staff is a bit off.. Not really smiles and proper more... Stoic and blah, and that is a no no. Especially given the hotel it's located at. Anyways, i came here on a weekday so it was kind of empty. But its a great bar nonetheless and i'd totally come back.","1968":"Views and the ambiance = some of the best on the Earth. The wait at the bar was surprisingly short and the drinks were delicious. It takes forever to get up here, their should a larger lobby and bigger, or more, elevators dedicated to transporting guests up and down. Their ought to be a little more of a dress code to, I don't like drinking near bummy looking broad and bros, haha jk. Thanks for the views and drinks bar!","1969":"This is my BEST CHOICE ever. The view is awesome. Nice breeze, cool air, good music, friendly service. The best is instead of paying $23 at sky park, we only pay $10 for a drink for the view, the drink, the soft sofa, the cool air. And we save some $$ for lunch. Enjoy","1970":"Great view. Lousy service. Rude bouncers. $200 minimum if you want to sit down, and you only get the table until 8pm, regardless of what time you sit. Food and cocktails are both overpriced and mediocre. DJ was spinning elevator music to make sure no one danced. Did I mention the great view?","1971":"The view is amazing and service is decent but the food is ho hum. I would still go at least once since it's on top of the main attraction in SG. Enjoy.","1972":"Spent my 36th birthday here... Great place, excellent service.Food was ok. \u00c2\u00a0I think it was overpriced but I guess you're paying to be on top of the world.","1973":"This review is mainly for the food at the restaurant. Let me start by saying that the view and ambiance is amazing, which is what you're going to pay top dollar for because the food is horrendous. I was there last night and basically spent $350.00 dollars just to be fed tablespoons full of salt and lime. Everything was topped off with buckets of salt like it's going out of fashion. I had to go back to my hotel and order a 2nd dinner because there was no way to eat the disaster they were trying to feed everyone. Bottom line: be smart and enjoy the view with some drinks....but save a lot of money by eating elsewhere. I know I'm personally never coming back here and am making sure no one else I know wastes their time or money here either!","1974":"In short, not worth it.We went up there because we heard the view is good. I was immediately stopped by the lady downstairs because of my shorts. I didn't want to disappoint my group so I went shopping for a pair of pants in the casino mall. Everything was expensive there. I wish there was a Costco or Walmart. But even the usual brands such as Gap cost at least twice as much as in the US. Finally I found a cargo pants at Guess marked down from S$120 to S$40 (~$32). I wouldn't pay $10 for it if I didn't have to go to the top.When we got to the top, first thing we noticed was that the bar area is separated from the observation deck and guarded. To see the view, you have to look beyond the observation deck, which makes the view from the bar obscured. The bar area is tiny and crowded. It turns out if you are only having drinks, you have to stand.A small beer costs S$16 and a small cocktail costs S$23. I've had way better drinks. They make the $20 martini on top of the Park Hyatt Shinjuku so worth it. We had seven people including two little kids. The first thing the waitress asked us was why we ordered only five drinks. BTW Singapore's legal drinking age is also 21.I walked around a little trying to catch different views. When I walked back to the bar area, I was stopped by a waiter asking if I was going to buy a drink.The view on the top, even without being obscured, is not that great. You can go to many high grounds (and free) in Hong Kong and have way better view of the skyline.I think they made one fundamental mistake - that is in order to stop a few lookie loo, they pissed many paying customers. Very different from how things are done here in the US.","1975":"there is one reason, and one reason only to go to ku de ta: LADIES NIGHT.best place to go on a wednesday night! the venue is packed and full of young attractive people. for everybody who complains about prices, get over it. it's singapore. everything costs twice as much for no good reason other than because singaporeans like to pay lots of money to show off how rich they are. don't hold that against ku de ta, the only venue crazy enough to prominently suggest revolution in it's name (albeit mispelled) in a police state \/ dictatorship.","1976":"So we were chilling out at this bar and restaurant located on the Sky Park right? Well, that's the one and only Ku De Ta. This restaurant is a perfect place to end your Sky Park experience. Although you can only dine inside via a reservation, you can take advantage of their bar. Our Sky Park experience ended with a noon cocktail. My mother had a rum-based orange drink while I had a vodka-based peach drink. I know it may sound weird, but surprisingly, it felt really good. The drinks were mixed well, we weren't able to taste that overwhelming alcohol. Just plain tropical refreshing goodness. Yes it was pricey but once in a while, it doesn't hurt to indulge.Aside from drinking, if you have something to celebrate and wish to do it on top of the world, Ku De Ta is just a phone call away to make your reservations","1977":"Let me come clean right away. The five stars is mostly based on the setting. How could anyone not be blown away by this place? Infinity pool on top of one of the tallest buildings in Singapore! I was impressed for sure! Far more than I expected.I didn't try the food, and the drinks were insanely expensive. I came here to watch the sunset while having drinks with friends. It was a mix of classy, casual, business, and elegant all at once. There were people who had been at the pool all day, others who were there for an after work drink, guests of the casino downstairs, and tourists like me \u00c2\u00a0all in the same place. It was a beautiful view and setting. We would have planned to stay longer but had tickets to a music show the same night.A must see!","1978":"After reading some of the other reviews of this restaurant on Yelp i was hesitant to try it. Being part of the Marina Bay Sands extravaganza, i knew it would be pricey, but i also knew it could be quite an unforgettable experience- and it did not disappoint!My friend and i had just been on a holiday through Germany and Switzerland over the Christmas and new year period, and had a few days in Singapore to thaw out and recover somewhat from our jet lag. Being the last night of our holiday, we wanted to do something memorable and a little bit fancy. After being recommended by friends that we \"must go to The Raffles and have a Singapore Sling\", and being slightly disappointed with the result, we decided to rely on our trusty Yelp app and see what else Singapore had to offer. Ku De Ta promptly popped up on the list, \u00c2\u00a0i had heard about the views from the sky deck previously from a work colleague so flicked through some recent reviews. By booking in to the restaurant we didn't have to pay the usual $20 to get to the sky deck, so we went up early and had a drink at the sky bar. We were greeted quickly by multiple friendly staff, and very soon we were sipping on cocktails and taking in the view- and what a view it was! With 180 degree uninterrupted views across the city and the bay, i would've been quite happy to pay the $20 for the view alone. It really is fantastic.The staff at Ku De Ta are brilliant. They're attentive and friendly, and go out of their way to make you as comfortable as possible. The menu is designed in a way that you are inclined to order a bunch of smaller dishes to share, so that's what we did.We ordered about five dishes to share, and all of them were exceptional. The mushroom, the pork, the scallops- all perfectly cooked, the flavours were balanced and there were a nice combination of different textures too. The dishes were all plated with care, it was obvious the chef had thought of all aspects of the dining experience when creating the menu. I suppose the only downfall of the whole experience was the dessert- the flavours were surprisingly bland after such fresh and enjoyable combinations in the previous course; and yes, the wine and other alcoholic drinks we ordered with our meal and afterwards at the bar were really pricey. But, from what i could tell, alcohol anywhere in Singapore is pricey!All in all, it was an amazing experience, the views were phenomenal (especially once the sun set), the wait staff are friendly and attentive and the food although not the cheapest around, was delicious, well presented and creative. Would i go back next time i'm in Singapore? Absolutely! For a special last-night-out meal and a fantastic cocktail with the best view of the city- you can't get better than Ku De Ta! I'd probably skip the bottle of wine with dinner to save a couple of bucks next time though... ;-)","1979":"The drinks were surprisingly \u00c2\u00a0good for a spot which I assumed would be touristy. The view is obviously amazing and the service was good. Will go back with all visitors.","1980":"The view is amazing. U can see maylasia to the north and Indonesia to the south. The calamari is highly recommended. Drinks are around 20 plus dollars.","1981":"One of those must go to places for visitors to Singapore. I've heard mixed reviews of the food and service and had few expectations going in. \u00c2\u00a0I think the best value is a drink where you can take in the city view. \u00c2\u00a0The music was horrible, I am unsure how to describe it, pseudo clubby techno Muzaky. While you have your $16 beer or $30 wine you might enjoy the expansive views, while being elbowed by pushy tourists. \u00c2\u00a0Look just one level down where more tourists are taking selfies, tired couples take their shoes off and rub their feet with backs propped up against the glass fence. \u00c2\u00a0There were also a half dozen guests who had wandered over from the other side where the pool is, clad in bathrobes and slippers, armed with iPhone so everyone else will know where they've been. I'm glad I went up and I'm really glad I didn't have to suffer a meal and that awful music.","1982":"This review is for the restaurant... Why is the quality of food so dismal? Highly NOT recommended for the dining experience. I found myself ordering bottles of sangria to make up for lost calories I was prepared to inhale.","1983":"About what I expected, but if you just want to do the view on 56 put the $40 admission to lunch. Yes, it's way over priced but your getting a $40 credit. We had two dishes, 3 drinks and it was about $100. Food was decent, overdescribed and overpriced but again expected. \u00c2\u00a0We had the view plus and though we could not get to or see the pool it was fun.","1984":"Went up to the Sky Park in the middle of the afternoon and saw great views of the city. \u00c2\u00a0Walked around and started craving for a nice cold adult beverage and this was the place we ended up at. \u00c2\u00a0They got the lounge vibe down with the decor, music, and mixed drinks. \u00c2\u00a0We sat outside by the bar area where they have cabanas and tables shaded with umbrellas. \u00c2\u00a0Only had a beer here so I can't review the food, but it looked pretty good (and expensive I'm sure). \u00c2\u00a0No cover charge during the day. \u00c2\u00a0 A mixed crowd, mostly tourists (like myself) from what I could tell.","1985":"The view is spectacular whether you have drinks or dinner here. The sashimi salad was very fresh, with large pieces of fish and a tangy, spicy dressing. The dish could have used more leafy greens, but overall a delight. The pork belly is good and flavorful, but the consistency in cooling was uneven (some pieces were dry and didn't have sauce). The udon noodles were well cooked and seasoned.","1986":"You can not be in Singapore and not stop by Ce La Vi at the tower #3 in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The view is breath taking!!! Make sure you have reservations they don't take walk ins and go there at night.The food varied from average to good but the overall dinning experience was one of a kind. The service was excellent. Oh and you can walk into the club after dinner.","1987":"After a long day in Gardens by the Bay this is a nice little bar on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel to finish with a well deserved beer. \u00c2\u00a0They have a pretty good snack menu and the view is spectacular. \u00c2\u00a0The staff seems a bit tired and uninterested but that beer tastes so good after walking around for hours in 30C + heat that you forget about that.","1988":"Nice view, though it is largely obstructed by the sky deck which wraps around slightly lower. The drinks are so exorbitantly price though and fairly small. Good for a drink with a view but you won't really be saving the price of a sky deck admission or getting the same quality view. The staff is ok and the ambiance is surprisingly relaxing during the day.","1989":"Perched on top of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, KU D\u00c3\u0089 TA is definitely one of the best views of the Singapore skyline you can get. A lot of tourists do not realise that while it costs $20 to tour around the Skypark, it makes much more sense to instead get a drink or meal at KU D\u00c3\u0089 TA, and with the receipt you can gain access to the Skypark as well. KU D\u00c3\u0089 TA is separated into two sections, a restaurant with a Skybar, and a club lounge on the other side towards the swimming pool. KU D\u00c3\u0089 TA restaurant is a modern Asian cuisine concept with a social dining aspect where we are encouraged to get a few dishes to share in the middle, which is a typically Asian tradition. My favourite dishes: the tempura yasai roll which was a beet and cream cheese sushi that was fried tempura-style, aburi salmon sashimi that had delicious salty miso notes, their signature crispy sticky baby squid and the seared yellowfin tuna steak which came with was separated into two: one with a lime seasoning and the other with a shishito pepper seasoning, with a huge blob of avocado sauce in the middle that was utterly delicious. However, the MUST-TRY is the desserts. Their signature Apple & Honey is not as simple as the name implies - it is a visual feast as well as a taste that was a sensory overload, which was surprisingly not overly sweet. A pleasant surprise was the Wasabi Ice Cream, which was really palatable and easy to eat even to some of my friends who usually do not take wasabi. Overall, the meal was not light on the wallet, but it was definitely in tune with their motto: 'A lifestyle less ordinary'.","1990":"The main reason why you would want to go there, apart from the stunning views it offers, are the bragging rights to say that \"I've been there\". I was fortunate enough to be one of the first few people to go there when it was officially opened and I went back again to check out the service, and I must say it really isn't that awesome. There's a wide variety food and drinks on offer, though it's nothing much to shout about as they're all fairly decent and not exactly worth the price you pay. The views though, are a whole other matter, and if you haven't been there, you should pay the place a visit, and have some drinks instead. Do take note that you'll be standing as the tables are reserved for diners only.","1991":"I am giving it 4 stars because of the view. \u00c2\u00a0The food was bar food, not bad but not good. \u00c2\u00a0I dont have much more to say about it since that is all there is if you are not interested in the Singapore nightline. \u00c2\u00a0I stay at the hotel so didnt have to stand in line at the lobby to get there. \u00c2\u00a0Last year I saw a Jessie J private concert here and for a concert it is a venue I will never forget...","1992":"I REALLY wanted to love this place. The view is spectacular and the restaurant space is gorgeous. The food, however, was terrible. We had thought that at 21 dollars, the mizuna salad would be a little more than just a bunch of citrusy greens with flavorless crumbs. The pork belly lollipops were lacking in flavor as well. My husband's beef tenderloin was, in his own words, \"disgusting\". My roasted salmon was below average. The fried rice was bland and oily. Even the cocktail I ordered had some unpleasant notes to it. Because we had met the minimum spend, we decided to skip dessert because we had no reason to expect that it would be worth paying for after the disappointment of the previous courses. The taste just wasn't there and we were still hungry when we left. It's just a bunch of trendy ingredients used in a way that brings nothing out of them on the flavor front.Overall, it seems like the chefs at KU DE TA don't feel they have to put in any effort because everyone is there for the view anyway and the minimum spend takes care of everything. As great as that view is, I'd never go back to this restaurant.","1993":"The view is certainly five stars and the food maybe 4.5, but the service was just barely there. We had a reservation at 8:30 pm for six people and were seated promptly. Ordering the wine and cocktails was an effort because we couldn't really find the waiter. There is a lot of fan fare around the menu presentation, putting little lights on so you could see in the semi-darkness, but beyond that we were waving down anyone who came near us. Food was great. All sharing style--we had raw oysters (not much can go wrong), the beef carpaccio was nice simply because the cut of beef was to die for, sushi rolls were pulled-from-the-sea but we had to ask for more wasabi, sashimi salad was very nice. The lamb was tasty and cooked to perfection, the seared scallops were overpowered by some overrout foam perched on the top, the pork belly was fabulous, perfectly seasoned and the grilled halibut was a real treat. For dessert, the garam masala cake was a sweet ending to the meal as was the chocolate fondant. Sounds like we had a lot (I didn't even mention everything) but really just small bites and pretty much everything was delicious, but without distinction for the price. You pay for the view and it's worth it. Singapore at your feet is very delightful--the 57th floor overlooking everything--ahhhhhh. Make sure you bring plenty of Sing dollars!","1994":"I had a luxurious and fun-filled dinner up here at Ku De Ta and LOVED it! \u00c2\u00a0The view is unsurpassable - much better than Altitude. \u00c2\u00a0The pre-dinner drinks at the terrace bar provided the best view. \u00c2\u00a0I still dream about the two lychee martinis I gulped down. \u00c2\u00a0The food was delicious pan Asian \/ Asian fusion fare. \u00c2\u00a0The service was terrific. \u00c2\u00a0Our table was right on the edge of the terrace, so we enjoyed sweeping views of the city below. \u00c2\u00a0The only \"rub\" would be that it's pricey. \u00c2\u00a0So if you are looking for a bargain, you're best served going to a hawker stall and not trying to find a bargain at the top of the Marina Bay Sands.","1995":"Went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Views were ok, food ranged from so so to a little better than so so - nothing memorable. Prices, as expected, were high. Service was good. Ambience was pretty good. I probably won't be going back at these prices, but nice to do at least once.","1996":"Tacky, wacky, everything you'd expect a casino rooftop bar to be. Bar managed a okay cocktail that was off menu but otherwise the atmosphere was feral and transient. I guess this is what people have come to expect of the orient with the emphasis on bigger equals better. Unfortunately, something important is lost in the translation.","1997":"I know, I know.When you think Ku De Ta... you probably let out a wistful whistle, and gush at how awesome the view must be.For me, that was EXACTLY IT... but not much else.I was there as part of \u00c2\u00a0a big party - 12 of us for a cousin's birthday, so I thought we'd be able to try lots of stuff. After all, the server did remind us that the restaurant concept was built around sharing plates. Being a big-ish party meant we ordered a fair amount of food, and we waited with glee for them to emerge from the kitchen, and as the appetisers rolled out, I did a little cheer on the inside - I was super hungry! But then I realised.... we got sushi? It kinda looked like a California maki, except it had a ton of roe on the top. Pretty... but boring. Then came the vegetable tempura (meh), cold spinach (meh) and a squid tempura? That was pretty tasty. It wasn't all bad, there was a pretty amazing salad - great dressing - with an amazing COLD sliced pork belly. Now this was a cold sliced meat, and in the words of many (who might have been speaking about other things...), that belly? It seriously just melts in your mouth. The chilled meat had this gelatinous texture that was quite a distinction. So that was pretty good.The entrees though... were the bulk of the let-down. I'll be brief. The good? \u00c2\u00a0We had some well-seasoned lamb.We also had some prime Angus, and duck that didn't taste like duck, and I don't think in a good way. We had some garlic chicken? Mum wanted some carbs, so we had fried udon, but it appeared and tasted like phad thai, and it wasn't even good pad thai. Felt like someone tried to be too Asian. But this is Asia, you argue. But what do you say to sesame seeds on almost everything?Time for dessert, and we were hoping for redemption. Beautiful plates. I got a steamed palm sugar cake dish, but my cake... was kinda dry. the other elements were tasty though - a quenelle each of salted caramel and hazelnut cream, and some puffed rice for texture? The Bounty cake wasn't bad either, and I think we enjoyed the extra scoops of coconut ice cream and lychee sorbet best. Those were made on premises, so they get points for that.At the end of the night, the view is the most redeeming. It's always amazing to see a city skyline from height, and our city's skyline is rather pretty indeed. Come for the view - that, at least, deserves the trip.","1998":"Food not good. \u00c2\u00a0View is only reason to go. \u00c2\u00a0Extremely overpriced. \u00c2\u00a0Tried chefs tasting menu... What a mistake. \u00c2\u00a0Oh and the desert tasted like a dish sponge with a side of Metamucil","1999":"Love this vibey gastrobar!It's a great place to stop during happy hour or hang out all night. \u00c2\u00a0The decor is vibey modern with exposed brick and raw wood surfaces. Their drink menu is extensive (and expensive) and includes a flaming Chuck Norris signature cocktail (Hint: don't drink the chuck norris).The owners are lovely and very invested in making this a cool place to hang. Love!","2000":"Fun find in the up and coming neighborhood of Tiong Bahru. If you're unfamiliar with the area, getting here can seem a bit tricky as the location is a bit off on the map. If you get out at Tiong Bahru Plaza, cross Tiong Bahru Road (towards Jalan Membina) and go left towards Kim Tian Road, which runs parallel to Jalan Membina. Take a right on Kim Tian, and it'll be a little bit past Big Mama, the Korean restaurant. If you're a brisk walker like I am, it's about a 5 minute walk!*Now back to our regularly scheduled review* In an attempt to show off my work neighborhood, I decided to bring my husband here tonight for a weeknight dinner. It wasn't too busy, and because the weather was cooperating, most people were hanging out on the patio. The inside is spacious and trendy, with warm lighting. Again, it's one of those places that utilizes those really cool lights that all the hipster places have!They specialize in craft beer and cider, but sadly we weren't in the mood for beer tonight. Their cocktail list is pretty decent, although they can run out of things. (Miguel wanted the Japanese Old Fashioned, and it was out of stock!) We ended up trying the Coq Eye, which is their take on an espresso martini. The verdict? It's a dangerous drink because you can't taste the alcohol!For food, I had their carbonara, which was one of their current specials on the board. For $14, I thought it was well priced for its portion, and good if you're looking for something heavy. Miguel ordered the Brazen Beef Steak, one of their main entrees, but thought it was small and overpriced at $24.They do have TVs here, so I'd imagine that this is a good spot to watch games as the extensive beer list and tapas menu would have you covered. Staff is courteous and proactive in providing suggestions on what to try.Between this place and Fourskin, one's gotta wonder how some of these businesses get away with their names! But I'm not going to complain- glad some people here can handle a sense of humor.","2001":"Pretty cool bar in the middle of Tiong Bahru. \u00c2\u00a0On Thursdays and Fridays usually packed with a mixture of expats and locals. \u00c2\u00a0The bar also shows certain football and rugby games and tends to have specials on those days as well. They have a variety of beers as well as different appetizer specials for happy hours daily. \u00c2\u00a0The staff is relatively helpful and friendly. \u00c2\u00a0They stop serving food rather early (10:30) pm on some days and if the bar is emptyish could be even earlier. The happy hour isn't much of a discount and the prices are pretty typical of an expat bar. \u00c2\u00a0Still the bar is worth a visit if you are in the area!","2002":"The burger was below average--seriously, McDonald's is better. My friend's salmon was overcooked and came out 15 minutes after my meal! The whole experience was awful. Save your money.","2003":"This is a great bar! The bartenders are serious about their cocktails and make it a point to get it right. They're also rad to talk to (Michael was our bartender and he's awesome).","2004":"Had high hopes, but quite disappointed. The atmosphere was nice, attractive hip decor. The best part about this place was the amazing music playlist, though it was slightly to loud for having a conversation. The waitress was very persistent about getting our order. Ordered the \"JAPANESE OLD FASHIONED\" which has no relation to an old fashion and tasted like smokey water (no flavor of alcohol at all). When I let them know, their response was that was how it was supposed to taste. They gave me half off so pretty much I paid for a $9 glass of water. The food was sub par especially considering the price. I then proceeded to get a whisky on the rocks which came with a glass full of ice.... probably 15 cubes. You'd expect a \"gastropub\" to know better!The only reason I would go here if it was during happy hour and I wanted to play foosball.....","2005":"I like this place a lot. It's a bit out of the way but has a really chilled out vibe. They have an awesome range of beers but I'm not really adventurous when it comes to booze. I like to stick to the classics and mostly whatever's on tap. I've tried a few bites to eat and I think it's not too shabby. Nothing to shout abt, but for the prices, I reckon the quality is still there and I'm not complaining. I've tried the katsu curry chicken, the steak and the fries and spam fries. All in all, it's a great place to wind down with 90s alternative hits like Weezer, incubus etc.. Plus I can have a decent meal there if I'm hungry. Worth a night to check it out. Service is good an friendly too not forgetting!","2006":"Stuff your mouth with this awesome new bar in the TB","2007":"Wasn't expecting much from this place at first...just did a walk by came back to grab a beer. \u00c2\u00a0WOW the chicken quesadilla is off the chart. \u00c2\u00a0 Thinking about foregoing our original plans and staying for something more than an app!","2008":"Love this spot. Great food, great beer selection. TVs and foos ball, you can't go wrong. Slightly pricey, but not bad for Singapore.","2009":"While the name was funny, I didn't know what to think. I got in and was pleasantly surprised by the modern take on an older Tiong Bahru establishment. It was extremely comfy, and had too much of a home feel: I loved it! The service was amazing, and the waitress informed us right away of any drink specials they were having, while not being too pushy, of course. Their menu was pretty straightforward, comfort food which is what they promised. All my friends had a burger which was amazing, and those fries, hands down the best I've had in Singapore to date. Their fried crispy garlic chicken was exactly that, and I can't emphasize how comforting the food was. I saw on the website they often have live music, so would be cool to check out then. For Sunday brunch though, can't complain it has everything you might want: good food, good drink specials, and the fact that you can walk around Tiong Bahru afterwards. Highly recommended indeed!","2010":"Another one of those completely random and yet serendipitous finds when wandering around in search of booze. The joint was partly hidden behind some construction, upon which was boldly spray painted \"BALLS WILL ROLL\". Intrigued, we headed in and were informed that C&B would only be officially opened the next day, but we were welcome to have drinks if we so wished. Magic words, my friend, magic words.The place is done up literally brick and mortar style, and has a rough, edgy look to it. A section of roller shutters is used in place of a chalk board, and photo frames of ostriches adorn the brick wall. Very interesting! And the loo looked like something out of a derelict and haunted mental hospital, what with its rickety metal washbasin. Tres cool.A really delightful girl named Sylvia came up and chatted with us, and we were told that we were first customers. Go us! She also recommended us some beers and as C&B specialises in imported beers, there was a pretty good variety available. We started off with the recommended poisons - Swedish strawberry and lime cider, and a couple of Japanese red and white beers. As bloody Marys and mojitos are typically our poisons of choice, Sylvia helped ask the bartender if he could come up with a concoction, given that these were not on the menu. To our surprise, he obliged, and whipped up an awesome mojito - strong, sweet, tangy and deliciously minty. The Bloody Mary, he promised, would be for our next visit down, and he'd tweak it with chilli padi and curry powder for a proper Asian kick. Sold, I say! Round two: more booze to be had - a blond that had an oddly metallic smell but neutral taste, a crisp pear cider and yet another of the yummy mojitos. By the time the bill came round, we were very happily on our way to sloshdom. To our surprise, we were given 25% off drinks, which was a very kind gesture on the part of C&B, especially so when the launch that night was meant only for friends. Next strategic move: to become best buds with Sylvia and bartender!","2011":"Just stumbled on this place. \u00c2\u00a0What a fantastic gem to find on a Sunday afternoon. \u00c2\u00a0Great vibe, music and friendly service. \u00c2\u00a0Impressive selection of beers. \u00c2\u00a0Will definitely be back.","2012":"We came here to try a traditional Singaporean breakfast with kaya toast. The meal is served with eggs, and a choice of iced tea or coffee. The iced tea tasted like lemon iced tea, and I realized later was a little strange to be drinking during breakfast, but oh well. Then, when I tried the coffee -- it was very much to my liking. Next thing you know is that I ordered an iced coffee to-go after we finished our breakfast. In the future, I'm going to have to take some of that Singaporean coffee with me back to the states for us and our friends.Back to the kaya toast -- it's regular white bread toast that is loaded with guilt, but it tastes so good. Who can resist? So again, it is white bread with a pat of butter, honey, and Hainanese coconut jam spread. It's a \"can't miss\" when you're in Singapore! I'll need to take some of those jam spreads home the next time I visit Singapore too.","2013":"Delayed post. I visited this location back in March 2017.I love how this was a simple, fast, breakfast place that serves a hearty food. My mom and I ordered and our meal showed up maybe 5 minutes later. I got pre-set menus that came with Kaya toast and a soft boiled egg. Fishball noodle soup. Yum!This place is where locals grab a quick bite to eat before they move on with their day. It's seat yourself but could also end up sharing tables. It's semi outdoor seating so if you're into A\/C, this might not be the location for you. I think tissues are 30 cents so remember to bring your own. After you're done, you can walk off your breakfast through the strip of nicely air conditioned malls!","2014":"This is a great locals place. Great for breakfast and lunch. We are just here for breakfast but menu items can be for lunch too. The coffee, local Singapore style is great here. Very rich and creamy with the condense milk. Very much like Vietnamese coffee. Iced or hot is good. The laksa is only 4.50 and well worth it. Must come back and try other dishes.","2015":"I have to admit we didn't really know what we were eating. But a very friendly Singapore couple helped us eat it and then gave us good tips on the rest of our travel. We had the typical Singapore coffee, which has condensed milk in it. Too sweet for me, but the partner loved it.","2016":"Excellent food and great value for money. They stick to a basic menu and is a favourite haunt of Singaporeans. My favs-the chicken curry and Kopi C. The service is quick but be ready to expect a typical open air Kopitiam experience.I love the chicken curry with French toast\/rice; for people from the state of Kerala in India, the taste will remind you of Mom's chicken curry. Kopi C is the closest alternative to good coffee with milk.","2017":"Step into Sakurazaka at the affluent Greenwood Estate and you would be forgiven for thinking that you are in a restaurant in Japan. Sakurazaka is the new restaurant of Consultant Chef Masashi Horiuchi (also of Shelter in the Woods and Verre Wine Bistro), and it marries Masashi's Japanese heritage and European culinary roots in this Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki restaurant. Tuck into one of the 3 Shabu Shabu sets available at Sakurazaka- Pork ($48), Seafood ($54), or Beef ($64). Each set comes with the stone grilled Ishiyaki (Iberico, Seafood, or Wagyu), meats, vegetables, and a dessert (traditional Kakigori) to end off! It's always fun to be able to participate in your meal. Dip the sizzling grilled meats into the onsen tamago with mild Sukiyaki sauce. Have your choice of Shabu Shabu in 6 different broths specially created by Chef Masahi. Expect an infusion of European flair in the special soup stock with the rich and tangy Bouillabaisse stock and light Beef Consomm\u00c3\u00a9; or have a taste of Kyushu with the Ago Dashi (dried flying fish stock). Of course, the regular Chicken, Tonkotsu, and even Soya Milk are available. My favorites are the versatile Ago Dashi, and the slightly milky Tonkotsu.To accompany the prime meats and seafood, 3 special dipping sauces are provided. My favorite is the refreshing and light peppery and very versatile Tamari Ponzu made with miso essence and yuzu. The Shiyo Ponzu is a slightly tart sudachi with seaweed salt. Of course, there's also the rich Goma sauce, with a touch of espelette pepper in this one. \u00c2\u00a0Have the Seafood set with the Bouillabaisse stock for that superb umami flavor at the end. Tiger prawns, white clams, succulent scallop, red snapper, squid, and mussels are in this one. The fresh prawn paste was definitely my favorite of the lot. The minced prawn is mixed with lotus roots, shiitake mushrooms, and shiso.The Pork set is very enticing with the Kagoshima Shirobuta Pork (loin and belly). This meat is whiter, tender, and slightly sweet; and the fats are translucent with a light chew. Superb! Beef lovers would go gaga over the Japanese Aomori rice-fed beef (striploin and rib-eye)! The cows are fed with whole rice crop and spring water from Mount Hakkoda for that umami flavor. Lucky them and lucky us! We enjoyed the meaty texture of the striploin and the ribeye had a good fat to meat ratio as well. I actually prefer the Aomori to the Joshu Wagyu. I'm not saying that the F1 Joshu Wagyu Beef from Gunma isn't a good option (a la carte option). Just look at that marbling! The fats melted easily with a few swishes in the soup (have the Tonkotsu for that added beef-pork savory flavor), and the huge skirt of beef would break apart if you are not quick enough. The amount of tender fats was just a little of an overkill for me. The overall mouth feel was a tad fluffy and pillowy. It's just a personal (non) preference #firstworldproblem.You could also order the generous slices of foie gras for an added indulgence. I still prefer my foie gras seared.At the end of meal, you can choose to have rice poured into the leftover broth in the pot for Sakurazaka's version of a risotto. Cheese and egg are added to the mix as well and you could then top it up with the side condiments of chili miso, garlic and chili oil, spring onions and sesame. Our version made with the Bouillabaisse stock created an explosion in our mouths. It tasted like a creamy Hae Bee Biam Chili Chwee Kueh almost! I'm never going anywhere else for Sukiyaki after being spoilt by Chef Masashi. The F1 Wagyu-Holstein cross-breed beef in the Sukiyaki set has a very good marbling and is considered the best Wagyu cross-breed. The meat and vegetables are first cooked in a pan, followed by the addition of broth and condiments such as soy sauce, sugar and mirin. Chef Masashi had refined the sukiyaki sauce and made it less sweet to suit the local palate and we thought he nailed the balance. The recommended sauces are the ponzu, and sesame sauce. And obviously there's a raw egg in the mix too.Rounding off the meal is the Kakigori, made of finely shaved ice, flavored with syrup and condensed milk - similar to patbingsu, haluhalo, and ice kachang. Ujikintoki Green Tea is obviously a crowd pleaser and there's an intense green tea ice cream hidden inside. Another refreshing one that we enjoyed is the Port Wine Kakigori with port wine jelly and blood orange. I'm definitely a fan of Sakurazaka. I think this is almost the only reason for me to make the trek down to Bukit Timah. Individual sets are available now so you can satisfy your craving even if no one else wants to (are you kidding me)!","2018":"Great shabu shabu place with beautiful decor and good service. \u00c2\u00a0The wagyu is well marbled even for the standard level beef. \u00c2\u00a0 You can up a notch but you better love the really marbled meat. \u00c2\u00a0We ended up ordering extra beef, chicken meat ball and vegetables and ate all of it. \u00c2\u00a0With the price range, I think it should give you a bit more veggies and noodles\/rice though.","2019":"Four words: Hokkaido milk shaved ice.I'd go back for the dessert alone. Came here for a birthday dinner, we were about twenty. The restaurant is nicely decorated. Simple, elegant with a Japanese flair and sakura blossoms on the ceiling for obvious reasons. The staff were very accommodating when we added extra table settings, chairs, drinks and changed orders multiple times. You have the option of ordering three different shabu-shabu menus: pork, seafood or beef, from cheapest to most expensive respectively. I had the seafood (approx S$55).All menus come with an appetizer of sliced marinated Wagyu beef you personally set on the hot stone served with it. Pretty darn good.The rest is typically shabu-shabu style. The seafood was fresh and the portions adequate.Menu includes a shaved ice dessert and you have the option of choosing between Hokkaido milk, Green tea red bean and mango. Was a tough one. Hokkaido milk comes with malt milk candy and is just the right amount of sweet.I like this spot. Understated and plain good.","2020":"This is perfection. Serving up some fast noodle goodness that makes you want seconds. Generous portion for hawker style (though at $5.50 SGD for the large size). And it's absolutely delicious. I could eat this all the time if I had the choice back at home.P.S. You can customize the bowl however you want as well. I asked them to remove the bitter gourd on the second pass as I wasn't a big fan.","2021":"Best best yong tau foo from Albert Food Centre at Queen Street near the famous Kwan Imm Hood Cho Temple.Serves handmade Yong Tau Foo pieces all freshly prepared. Soup is light yet flavorful, without MSG!Was no. 12 in queue at 11 a.m. received 5 packs of takeaway at 11.18 a.m. very fast.They also have outlets at People's Park Complex and Chai Chee (See photo).The order can be:1. with or without bitter gourd, 2. with or without bee hoon, 3. $4.50 or $5.50.When you eat there, they are super stingy with the sauces. Ask for one more (very little) and you will have to pay 30 cents.Today I asked for more and was surprised that I didn't have to pay for more chilli sauce and there was a lot of it too. Super duper hot chilli sauce.","2022":"A very good, well done, straight up noodle and fish ball type place. \u00c2\u00a0The food is simple, yet very well done. \u00c2\u00a0The line moves rather quickly so it's not a terrible wait! You will be asked if you want the bitter melon or not. \u00c2\u00a0I hate bitter melon, but this place did it really well, where it is only a light bitterness.","2023":"Yong Tau Foo. Yum. Even though there was no choice (a la traditional self service kind) in what food pieces (or \u00e6\u0096\u0099) I could choose, the food given is quite interesting and unique. There's this special handmade prawn \"cake\" (like fish cake but made with prawn) which looked lovely and tasted as well as it looked. The other pieces were also quite good, and there's this bitter gourd with meat paste - they will particularly ask you if you eat bitter gourd, so as to not surprise some unsuspecting customer I think.They only serve beehoon, and the beehoon is nice. Springy and not soggy. The soup is refreshing and flavourful (I think they used ikan billis as part of the stock). And best of all, because of their streamlined operations, queueing isn't that bad. I'm just wondering why the queue isn't longer than it ought to be, maybe everyone else at Albert Park is missing out (:Nevertheless, if there's any issue, is that it isn't entirely filling. Well, this means time for dessert! Update: I've eaten twice already, and am looking to eat more when I am in the area. I have included some additional information in the tip as well.","2024":"We went to the stall at viva business park. It was a horrible experience! I ask the man for the dry Yong tau foo and told him to put the chilli at the side. He told me that he cannot put it at the side and he just poured the chilli on top it. It was almost inedible!","2025":"It's funny how things work out. Just when you think Singapore does not have that much new to offer it surprises you. Wandering from Doby Ghaut to the Auld Alliance to sample some whisky we wondered up Selegie road to find a store selling vinyl records on Record Store Day. Then we wandered toward Rochor Road and Little India and were diverted down MacKenzie Road by a Yelp review that we did not quite get to. Instead we saw a bar down a sidestreet and headed that way with a desire for a beer. The bar turned out to Pondok. The Hut. A bar and restaurant that is really different from the mainstream in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0 Unsure whether to enter at first, a friendly smile and a gesture from someone outside settled it. Decor is nothing too special but the atmosphere is friendly with the staff coming up to introduce themselves. We just tried the beer which had Heineken on draft and some Indian snacks were put on the table and replenished when empty. And again. And again. The pool table was constantly occupied with some folks bringing their own cue's. We will definitely return to this bar, \u00c2\u00a0maybe try some food but for sure soak in the friendly atmosphere.","2026":"For years I've been coming to this hawker stall for perhaps the best fishball soup do I dare say in Singapore? \u00c2\u00a0Always a long line waiting for their food and many times they sell out by 9:30 am so get their early! Located in Albert Food Centre just North of Bugis St, At stall 01-102. \u00c2\u00a0Closed Mondays.","2027":"4.5 starsA stall in the Albert Hawker Centre--likely one of the most popular. The line for this place starts right when it opens, sometime before 6:30am. Is the hype worth the wait? Food: very yummy bowl of fishball noodle soup for S$4. You pick wet or dry, and select your preference of noodle. The prices are 3.5\/4\/5 (although unclear which matches to what).They run this place super efficiently. Left line to order, right line to pay and pick up.Great value, very polite--get it if you're in the area!","2028":"Hock Lee Fish Ball Noodle at \u00c2\u00a0Albert Centre Market & Food Court has the longest line..and of course my Yelp Friend decide to give it a try..Long line and busiest usually a good signal of what's good in a Food Court, as that's always a reason why all these local people are lining up!We tried Fish Ball Noodle Soup, Fish Ball Noodle, and Fish Ball Soup. Everything of course has Fish Ball in it... So how's the Fish Ball? It does have a good bite and bouncy. I have to use my special chopstick skills, stabbing into the balls like skewers in order not dropping them!I do like the soup-less version the best, as I find the noodle has more bite, the hot sauce give it spicy and savoury complex taste.I think I really like the idea of having Fish Ball as breakfast...Give Hock Lee a shot if you are in the area!","2029":"I'm surprised at how good the fish head curry is. My friend has told me about it ages ago but the location put me off (I'm an Orchard Road girl after all). Then I saw it when I was at the coffee shop for Kim Keat Hokkien Mee, and realized it was not so far from home after all. My favorite type of fish head curry was of the spicy tangy type from my childhood. Not sure where my dad bought it from and my memory was too fuzzy to remember where it was. But it was a Chinese stall specializing in fish head curry somewhere in Serangoon area. Anyway, that is my benchmark for an awesome curry. Ocean Curry Fish Head is very close to that remembered taste. The curry is slightly spicy and has a tang to it. Besides the fish head, there are the usual veg in it (eggplant, tomato and okra) plus chopped green chilies and the surprise - pineapple. For a half head portion, there is plenty of meat that the 2 of us barely finish it. The price is quite ok. We paid $31 for the fish head curry (portion for 2 - half head), a side of vegetables and 1 plate of rice. The stall also has a wide range of dishes for economy rice. All of them look very appetizing and fresh. They will be a good option to buy home when you are too lazy to cook for the family.","2030":"Absolutely yummy goodness. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant is located in a larger shared space in the Toa Payoh neighborhood. \u00c2\u00a0First you order the fish head curry you want. \u00c2\u00a0It comes in small and large sizes depending on the number of people. \u00c2\u00a0Yes I said fish head curry so all you are getting is the head of the fish. \u00c2\u00a0Second there is a section where you can order small dishes as add-ons. \u00c2\u00a0They various veggie dishes and I recommend the bean sprouts with salted fish and the sambal kangkong (aka water spinach or convolvulus). \u00c2\u00a0You can also add rice to your meal.The side dishes came pretty quickly but the fish took a few minutes extra. \u00c2\u00a0It was served in a clay pot boiling hot. \u00c2\u00a0Wait a couple of minutes to let it cool down before digging. \u00c2\u00a0I recommend the meat from the cheek. \u00c2\u00a0That is best part of the whole fish. \u00c2\u00a0It's been a long time since I had a good fish head curry and I am satisfied.","2031":"$45 for 2... curry fishhead plus 3 side dishes..decent price... nothing fancy... good food...good for a family meal... easy parking.. n no waiting time..try it!!","2032":"I'll be frank to say that the food is not cheap but the flavour is there. They are afterall famous for their curry fish head.I like the option to have a quick and a affordable meal if you just pick dishes to go with rice on a single plate. Alternatively, you can order dishes and rices in separate dishes. That may be more expensive but more communal as a family meal. Other than the fish curry, the other dishes are also done very nicely. So don't worry and just order what looks good, chances are, it'll taste good too! This is my go-to place for picking up dishes to supplement a home-cooked meal.","2033":"This is hawker stall food at its finest. We had fresh hot chili garlic naan and Kashmiri naan.
