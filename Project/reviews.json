The line was extremely long but moved rather quickly, I got my burrito in 20 minutes.It's similar to Chipotle, fast food tex-mexy type burritos and tacos. It's okay not mindblowing, but the good part is that they're consistent. (extra star for that) It's good now that they are in a convenient location outside the central business district (CBD).3-stars. Overall consistency and that free burrito bribed me into giving another 1-star.","1":"Definitely a fan. This is my go to takeout\/delivery option as it is affordable and the portions are very generous.One of my top few mexican favourites in Singapore!","2":"Pulled pork mini burrito ($8.40) - 3 starsI really like that they offer mini burritos! Won't be getting the whole wheat tortilla the next time - the flavor just didn't quite fit in. The pork and beans were just okay. Not too dry, but the flavors could be better. The rice definitely has room for improvement - it could use better spices.","3":"I was excited with this place opened near me. I've tried them in Perth, Australia and really liked it there.Maybe it's opening pains, but it's just not the same. The ingredients aren't super fresh, and the meats were a little too salty.Those with kids beware - smoke from the nearby smokers' hangout will permeate into the al fresco dining area.","4":"Gave me the true Mexican street side experience (aka diarrhea). And yes I'm sure it was this restaurant - the rice tasted not fresh and it was the only thing I ate that night.","5":"Always a good place to grab a quick bite. My kids enjoy it too. The frozen lemonade is too sweet and I do wish they would hv a garbage can so that people can throw away their garbage. Love the biodegradable plates & cutlery.","6":"disclaimer: i am a big fan of chipotle mexican grill!the idea of having mexican food at a stone's throw away from my abode was so exhilarating! of course i have to give it a try asap and my first impression was, \"my! what a small shop front they have.\" their cashier counter was basically 3 steps away from the automatic glass door. the lady at the counter must have known it's not that easy to be staring at a steep menu board for long so she very quickly offered me the paper menu. I chose the spicy grilled steak with regular rice and a side of gucamole. she asked if i wanted sour cream. not being too keen about it, i replied, \"just a little.\" she said, \"sorry, we don't do just a little...it's additional 50 cents.\" that's when the first wave of missing Chipotle came crashing over me. i already accepted the fact I had to pay additional $2 for my guac and also they don't have corn as an ingredient in the bowl so I didn't think I want to splurge anymore for my $13 meal. Quickly i ended my order before i could do anything else stupid like ordering an additional side of churros with chocolate dip. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes and i was happy to find that they offer chipotle medium hot sauce at the condiment table; there were also sliced Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o and diced red onion plus 2 other kind of sauces. It was a good 30 minutes before i could eat and the bowl stayed pretty warm in the eco friendly to-go container. Another nice touch was the melted cheese on the rice but the real saving grace was the hot sauce I picked up on the way out. the sauce really gave the other wise regular tasting bowl its kick. if you like black beans then you will be happy to know they are very generous with their beans. i ran out of rice faster than i could eat the beans. By now i am completely missing Chipotle like crazy.Thanks Guzman and Gomez for offering me a decent bowl of mexican food. it doesn't completely satisfy me but I am glad you are in my life for now.","7":"Decent Mexican place with a variety of options. The outside seating area is prettier than the inside and the fans are enough to beat the heat. The burrito can be filling after a while so you might find it more enjoyable to have a small burrito and pair with sides like nachos. My friend opted for 2 quesadillas instead which looked rather small for a proper meal. My preference is the burrito bowl. The fish is surprisingly good- very fresh in big portions. The guacamole is also well prepared.","8":"It's ok. it's just ok. the burrito is a decent size, chock full of rice and beans, but the pulled pork was neither spicy (as advertised) nor particularly tasty. they have a nice salsa bar where you can load up on salsa and all the onions and cilantro\/coriander your heart desires.","9":"No shame. Queued for the free burrito during their opening.Beef was decent and juicy. The fish, I had lacked seasoning.However, I would recommend coming back for a hearty bite.","10":"This is nice. Close enough to to chipotle imo. So much meat stuck on my teeth. Tonight I'm a t rex.","11":"Yummy! Tried it for the first time and I must say I'm already a big fan. Had the pan seared barramundi burrito bowl with smoke chipotle sauce and extra guac. There is just so much flavour and spice in one bowl, which blended well together. Though the portion isn't huge, its enough to keep me satisfied. I'm glad that I'm able to find a similar version of Chipotle in Singapore!","12":"Food is fine.. It's Tex Mex, not hard to get it right. But the state of the property when visiting BEFORE the lunch rush at 11:53 am was an embarrassment . Floors are filthy, table tops filthy, waitresses uniform was covered with food as well. 4 thumbs down for cleanliness","13":"As a Californian from a Mexican family, I really started to miss tacos and burritos. I decided to explore every Mexican food place in Singapore(been here for over 2 months) and this is by far the best food for price. The burritos taste almost identical to Chipotle in the states, the tacos are really really good, and the quesadillas are delicious(my favorite). \u00c2\u00a0You can also get jarritos(Mexican Soda) and a pretty good guacamole. If you're from cali or want some really good tacos\/quesadillas I would definitely recommend this place. The burritos are just ok in my opinion(just like chipotle).","14":"4 stars for a mexican place in Singapore - if this place was in America, it would be 3 stars. \u00c2\u00a0It's the closest thing to Chipotle in taste, but not price. \u00c2\u00a0I love their steak burrito and steak burrito bowl. \u00c2\u00a0If you dont have the biggest appetite, definitely go for the mini burrito.","15":"I really like Guzman and regularly go here for lunch (I work across the street), but it can get pricey. My favorite order is the burrito bowl and ask them to add guac and switch out for brown rice. I would avoid the lines around noon on weekdays and pretty much any time on weekends.","16":"I paid a visit to the new branch at Star Vista, enticed by a free burrito flyer handed out at the mrt station. But when I got there shortly after 5, I was turned away by staff saying that the promo ended at 5. No end time was indicated on the flyer and the staff \u00c2\u00a0acknowledged that but still said the promo was over. Talk about false advertising! !! I told her to tell the manager that this was wrong but she casually dismissed me (the staff were having some kind of celebration and totally ignoring the customers) so I have zero confidence that she will pass my feedback. Hence I decided to post this.","17":"There's always a huge line up for Soup Nutsy during around lunch time and after passing by it who knows how many times, I finally decided to give it a try. And wow, am I nuts for Soup Nutsy! First thing you'll notice is that there are so many soup options to choose from. Options are a mix of staples that are available every day and daily specials. They are also quite accommodating for people with dietary restrictions, as they have soup options that are dairy free, vegetarian, low fat, amongst other restrictions as well. My personal favourite soup is the chunky chicken noodle... comforting and perfect for a gloomy day! Soups come in three sizes: small (12 oz), medium (16 oz) and large (20 oz). Don't be fooled by the size of the small soup because it really is more filling than you would expect!Although prices may initially seem steep for soup, you do get a well balanced meal and in comparison to the other food options in the PATH, the quality of food for the price point is really hard to beat. For just under $10 you can get a combo which comes with a small soup and two sides (options include bread, buns, apples, and bananas). Or for just a couple dollars more (around $3 more), you can get a sandwich, side salad, quinoa bowl, or fruit bowl instead of sides. They also have a bunch of snacks like cookies, oatmeal, and loaves for decent prices as well.So if you're on the fence about Soup Nutsy like I was, I highly recommend you give it a try! The line up does start growing at around 11:30 am and remains consistently busy all throughout the lunch hour so I would suggest coming early or ordering off Ritual. Worth the extra effort, I promise! Pro tip: Reuse your paper bag for 25 cents off your purchase!","18":"This is definitely the go to soup lunches in the path downtown! It's conveniently located right under the EY tower. There are many great selections of soups and various choices of sides like bread\/fruits\/veggie sticks. I had the clam chowder in medium with a banana and slice of bread for ~$11 after tax. It's definitely not your can soup stuff. The clams were tender and flavourful. There was good chunks of potatoes and celery. (1 star taken off because one large piece of potatoe wasn't diced) I went roughly at 11:40am and I cam see the crowds were on their way. Definitely recommend coming early before the line starts!","19":"The Lobster Bisque here is the Best, Jerry. The Best!The service here is much better and the people are much nicer here than in Richmond and Adelaide (people there, while not completely rude, seem quite stuck up, both times I was there).Quality: 9.5\/10. Service: 8\/10. Value: 8\/10. Overall: 9\/10","20":"Although it might easily seem that spending so much on soup isn't exactly worth it, I think Soup Nutsy might be an exception :) Every soup I've gotten here have been jam packed - they definitely don't skimp on ingredients here! The chicken noodle soup had such large chunks of chicken that I had trouble dipping my spoon in...not that I'm complaining of course. Also, their combos are a great deal since you also get a sandwich or salad - essentially 2 (or errrr 1.5) meals for the same price other places charge for 1.I do have to note that ordering here seems to be pretty disorganized. Even when I went at a time when they weren't busy, it was hard getting a server's attention and figuring out where to pick up the sides and so on. I also overheard another customer who had ordered online getting confused over her food being mixed up or something. So I wouldn't recommend coming during the lunch rush; it must be an absolute mess then. That is, more of a mess than the other messes around here...","21":"Best soup I've ever had in my life when I can get it. They sell out very early and when they are done they close up till the next day","22":"I decided to try this place our since it had some very good reviews. \u00c2\u00a0Firstly, keep in mind what their name is... Soup... so you'd think that is what their core business is... Soup. \u00c2\u00a0First time I tried this place, I made the mistake of arriving shortly after noon. \u00c2\u00a0Needless to say I was about 20-30 ppl back in the queue. \u00c2\u00a0My first thought was... well this is a good sign. \u00c2\u00a0So many ppl queued up, means it should be really good. \u00c2\u00a0I finally go to the point where I could order, I had picked up a pre-made sandwich from the cooler, and got a soup. \u00c2\u00a0I saw that they did some taste tests, but due to the number of ppl in the place, I decided not to try any, and just ordered. \u00c2\u00a0I had ordered, there were of course no spots to eat it, so I went back to the office. \u00c2\u00a0The soup was still volcano hot. \u00c2\u00a0However, it wasn't overly flavourful. \u00c2\u00a0Hmmmphf ! \u00c2\u00a0Go figure, being their core business, I would have thought it should be the best soup. \u00c2\u00a0The sandwich was good, but nothing overly fantastic either. \u00c2\u00a0I chalked it up to maybe it wasn't a good pick of a soup. \u00c2\u00a0About a month later, I decided to try it again. \u00c2\u00a0This time, I went before noon, was able to try a couple of the soups. \u00c2\u00a0Again, they were ok, but nothing fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0I had decided that I'd settle on one, and took that back to the office. \u00c2\u00a0Again, it was volcano hot, and again, it wasn't overly stellar. \u00c2\u00a0I gotta say, if your business is only soups, I would assume that you'd have something really fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0Again, I was disappointed. Overall, the price for the meal is a bit high, but I guess this is downtown Toronto. \u00c2\u00a0The soups I tried left me with a, meh, I've had better feeling. \u00c2\u00a0The sandwich was ok, but again, I'd rather pay for a freshly made sandwich instead of something that has sat in refrigeration all morning. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not feeling the love for the Soup Nutsy.... No Soup for me. \u00c2\u00a0I'm going to try other places thanks.","23":"Loving the Seinfeld references to the Soup Nazi episode! Beyond that, the first thing that surprised me was the cost! Holy cow. It was like $9.80 for one of the specials, Creole Shrimp Tomato Bisque. It does come with two \"sides\" where bread and fruit are your options. The second surprise was how gosh darn good the soup was! Holy moly. What amazing depth of flavour. The bisque was so velvety and creamy in texture without being too rich in flavour. Every spoon was as good as the last! The shrimp flavour sung brightly throughout. And the bread side was very fresh and was perfect for dipping! Gosh darn I hate the idea of paying $10 for a soup but it's hella worth it! One of the best bisques I've had!","24":"I was extremely impressed by their soup game! Came for lunch on a week day, each soup comes with 2 \"sides\" such as whole fruits or breads. The concept was weird at first - if you factor in the price, $8+ for a tiny cup of soup plus bananas & cold bread? Nonetheless, everything smelled so good, I had to give it a shot.I got a chicken pot pie soup, which came with little pie bits you can add in. The soup was PIPING HOT, I couldn't start eating it until I was done my bread. Bread was nice and fluffy and tasted nice with the soup. Soup itself was GOOD. Very rich and creamy; chunky with chicken, veggies and potatoes in every bite. It wasn't a chowder like soup, but more like you took actual chicken pot pie filling, added just a tiny bit of liquid and there's your soup! It was so indulgent and filling, I felt like I didn't need dinner that night.The price on the high end for me, especially if you're getting the meat\/seafood soups and the cup you get is a lot smaller than most places. However, you do feel comparably as full when you get a sandwich for the same value. I will definitely come back to try all their other soups!","25":"If you are in the mood for soup or chili this place is for you. They also have a fridge with freshly made healthy wraps etc. it's a great place. Remember to keep your bag they provide you for a discount on your next order. They also have a membership card towards collecting and redeeming for free soup. 4.0\/5 *","26":"This was my first time ever trying Soup Nazi but definitely not my last, i've been working in this building for two months and never found this place until today. What a great first impression! I showed up at 1 PM to ask for either the seafood bisque or the chicken gumbo as I like my food very spicy, and unfortunately both were sold out - sure enough just like the Seinfeld skit their response is \"no soup for you! \" so I ordered \u00c2\u00a0amazing beef stroganoff, and a medium which will feed me for two days was only eight dollars and came with 2 delicious fresh baked whole wheat roll. Plus when I was paying the lovely Jamaican cashier came over with a medium size gumbo that she had found in the back or something, and gave it to me for free with a wink. I think it's cute when people from spicy countries find it amusing that Caucasians like their spiciness. What an amazing deal, so now I have enough food for three days for eight dollars. Who would've ever guessed you could get a great deal financially on Bay street?","27":"I decided to get a chicken soup here today since I'm suffering from a cough. For $9 for a SMALL I expected this to be pretty damn good soup but was disappointed. It wasn't really anything special and I think I can make something better at home, maybe it wasn't the right soup to get but man that's highway robbery for a soup.","28":"Soup Nutsy offers a large variety of soups with the menu changing daily.. I believe you can check online for what soups are offered at each location.Soup Nutsy can be quite pricey if you order just a soup alone, but the combo is a good deal. For ~$9 you can get a combo size soup and a salad\/sandwich\/wrap.. which is not bad at all for lunch in the PATH. My favourite soup is the crab bisque.Remember to go early to avoid lineups and there is not much of a salad\/sandwich\/wrap selection if you come after the lunch rush. For returning customers, remember to bring your paper bag back for a $0.25 off your meal! :)","29":"I've tried Soup Nutsy twice now. \u00c2\u00a0I've had the Jamaican Crab Bisque and the Sherried Lobster Bisque. \u00c2\u00a0Both were excellent. \u00c2\u00a0The soups were full of crab and lobster and incredibly rich. \u00c2\u00a0The difference between a small and large is $9 vs. $11 so you do the math on where the value is (hint, it's the large). \u00c2\u00a0The sides are okay but they could do better here which is why I won't give it 5 stars. \u00c2\u00a0With so many soups to choose from I'll be going here for awhile now that I work in the building.","30":"I don't get it. I can't believe I spent almost $10 on soup. I visited a few weeks ago, around 11:45 AM on a weekday, and ordered the chilli, with two \"sides\" (if you could even call them that), where my total came to around $9.00, more or less. Again, on soup. Yikes.If the soup were made of gold, I'd understand the pricing. Then again, if quantity and quality matched the cost, I'd understand the pricing. But, for what it actually was, and what I actually received, I'm skeptical. The chilli was average and on the saltier side, and the two \"sides\" were: a) one small, measly piece of sliced bread, \u00c2\u00a0and b) a few chopped sticks of celery and carrots, wrapped sadly in a small piece of plastic wrap. As others have said, I don't understand the hype. With all the options there are in the PATH, I'd rather spend that $10 (or much less) on food of greater quality and quantity.","31":"Located in a food court on the path near Sheraton \u00c2\u00a0Centre. Wide variety of soups available in several sizes. They also have salads. I enjoyed the Spicy Southwest Lentil. The soup is served piping hot with your choice of two sides. Tasty and filling. A good choice for lunch. Prices are a bit high.","32":"I just paid 10$ for a tiny really salty soup and 2 pieces of stale bread. This is what a soup costs in a steakhouse like Keg.","33":"I just love to go to \"I don't know where I am going to eat\" food crawl. Soup Nutsy have so many soup choices and just thinking for to order just makes my head spin... and my Yelp Eating Friend has no choice but to line up, pick the soup, pay for it.. and screwed up the order.....Busy playing with my Yelp App.. checking in and uploading photo.. no idea what kind of soup I was eating..but really so so creamy..and wondering if my YEF wants to make me fat.. Should have come after 3 pm for Specials? Why we not doing that?? Why YEP kept mumbling that why soup so expensive? Why there's a line up? Why I picked 2 breads as a side? Why, I don't really know?!","34":"Craving soup and up for a change, I finally ventured out into the path the other day and found my way to the TD Centre where the famed Soup Nutsy was located.I was initially greeted by a long, discouraging line up that snaked outside the soup shop, inching its way towards the bank of ATM machines. My impatience was immediately assuaged as I noticed the line was moving quicker than what I initially anticipated. Inside the establishment was a fairly simple set up consisting of a counter with rows of soup cauldrons and an assembly line of staff members pouring each patron a cup of their desired size and flavor. All soups come with a fruit\/veggie bag + bread for roughly $8 (depending on what type of soup you get as meat, veggie, & seafood vary in price). They provide reusable soup nutsy bags that gives you 25 cents off on your next visit and also a loyalty card with the promise of 1 free small soup after the purchase of 10. The menu is pretty consistent offering an array of soups and a few seasonal changes and daily specials. That day I had a hankering for some crab so I ordered the Jamaican Crab Bisque. The small size soup is filling for lunch, especially since it is a thick soup. Smooth in texture, the creamy bisque was extremely flavorful with a hint of celery and spice. The chunks of crab meat in the soup were sweet and tender although scant throughout the cup. Overall, a delicious soup at a reasonable price for lunch in the PATH. I would not consider getting a \"plain soup\" (such as chicken noodle) that you can get for less than half the price at another chain restaurant in the path. This place is definitely worth a try but if you are going to spend $8 you may as well get a specialty soup.","35":"GUMBO? WHAT? DONE. FIVE STARS. YEPP. alright, y'all you can go home now. (Kidding!) I first came to know of this place after looking for places to grab soup for a sick friend of mine who lived nearby at the time. One of the best food discoveries I've ever stumbled upon, as its been four years and I still come back here when all I can think about is a big, tummy warming bowl of well flavored deliciousness and then I read what kinds of soups they have and well...*ends up teleporting over* Pros: -SO MANY CHOICES UGH BEAUTIFUL-daily specials that cater to the meat eaters, veggies and crazed cream connoisseurs-free samples! -I like how they have the 'pick two items' thing with your soups, it's nice to have a piece of fruit or soft bread afterwards (makes a good snack for later!) -after three, the soup special! Two huge soups, four sides, $15. BAM. Cons-after 3 special sometimes doesn't have everything (not a dealbreaker in my opinion) -semi-expensive otherwise, but on the same page as other edibles in the area (not a dealbreaker either) Totally worth a try if you're in the area during the non-lunch periods!","36":"I love the soup nutsy. I'm a frequent flyer and have been a happy customer for the last 5 years! I visit more frequently when I'm on the cabbage soup diet, because their miracle diet soup is basically the same thing. My only complaint can be blamed on high demand for their product... the first when they ran out of the soup I was basically served raw cabbage. The second I was served soup that was past its prime...I'm still in \u00c2\u00a0the bathroom as I write this. My only request is for discretion. If the soup is not ready, or past the best before date please don't force your locations to sell if off. Me and my co-workers will thank you.","37":"I'm a man of simple pleasures (as evidenced by my many chain restaurant reviews), but I can tell the difference between mediocrity and greatness. I would never compare Chili's and the like to top end restaurants like Alinea in Chicago. My reviews take this into account otherwise no chain would ever receive greater than 3 stars which is ridiculous. I just felt the need to explain this as I see many other reviewers don't do this. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't think that does these places justice.Anyway, food, pricing, and service; my main three attributes that pretty much determine my ratings. I thoroughly enjoyed my food. We ordered the nachos which usually can be a pile of hot mess, but each chip here was carefully prepared, plated, and topped with the same amount of cheese and toppings. Nachos always vary significantly even from one table to the next let alone different days so this was nice. They weren't the greatest since they were a bit cold and the cheese sort of hardened and not enough toppings to my liking but I like the idea.I ordered the Alex Santa Fe Burger with a veggie patty and upgraded the fries to the loaded fries minus the bacon for main. Very tasty and would highly recommend it even if you eat meat (like I do). Each dish was around $10 and we had a free kid's meal coupon that we used to take away. Less than $30 for a simple evening out with a nice snack to share later in the evening.It wasn't fancy or anything too special, but if you want to go out and be served and have a cheap meal then a place like Chili's is a place you should consider.","38":"Love chili's in general but this location is HORRIBLE. I have been ordering from this location for probably 9 months now probably once every 4-6 weeks. Every single time our order has been wrong\/ missing toppings, etc. Now, I'm THAT young millennial who will let someone cut in front of her because she can't make up her mind and\/or doesn't mind waiting 15-20 minutes for a table. So we place an order at 9:11pm. At 9:30 (like the app said) we leave to go get our food. We get there to pick it up and the woman says: \"Wanna know a secret? I accidentally gave your food to the people who just came in but yours is in and should only take another 10 minutes.\" What the hell?! I'm all for honesty but to try and joke about giving my dinner away? Not with it.So we wait. And wait. And wait. Oh and did I mention wait? 10:15, Food finally comes out, leave angrily and go home, open the box and buns are burnt & missing onions\/: Drive the extra distance to a better location. TRUST ME.","39":"I ordered a Buffalo Spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken breast was \"raw\" in the middle. Can you say Gross? I wouldn't recommend this location at all.","40":"It's your average Chili's, but the customer service here seems to be a lot better than the other Chili's. It can get a little hectic when there's a lot of people though... we had to wait about ten minutes for our check and a box.","41":"We stopped here for a quick lunch before we checked into our hotel. We were sat promptly when we arrived. We always wash the the table down before my son sits down as he has a shell fish allergy. The table had one of the ordering station and game centres. I was a little shocked at how dirty these things are! This is why they didn't get a 5 star  \u00c2\u00a0I had the boss! Great sloppy burger juicy AF!! The boneless wings were good also, the plate was allot larger than it needed to be. Made my son feel like there's something missing...  All and all it was a good lunch! Only recommendation would be to clean the tablets at each of the tables.","42":"I may be a chain snob, but Chili's is one of my guilty pleasures. Friday's and Applebees have never compared. Right now my favorite is a burger with cheddar, avocado, honey chipotle sauce, and jalapeno aioli. Messy, but so good.I'm also partial to fries with their inimitable honey mustard.They have a sandwich similar to the grilled chicken and avocado club at the Cheesecake Factory, but I haven't tried it yet to see how it compares.We get consistently excellent service at this location, and my burger is always cooked medium rare as ordered.They have a monthly $5 specialty margarita, but I especially love the blue margarita because it makes me think of the ocean.","43":"I drove all the way from toronto to new York to have Chili's! Specifically their Texas chili cheese fries! Yummm!!","44":"IF you LOVE: Chipped glass, COLD food, remade food with hair THIS is the location for YOU!! \u00c2\u00a0Felt bad for our waitress that had to deal with these issues from the bartender and kitchen until she decided it was better to seat new customers before getting me a fork so I could enjoy my 2nd try at hot food. The ONLY 2 things that made our meal ok was the warm chips and salsa the waitress brought while we again waited and hoped for hot food and the manager took off the price of the chicken tacos sprinkled with hair, plus half off my \"spicy\" \u00c2\u00a0shrimp tacos and gave my daughter a piece of cheesecake to take home in a bag tipped sideways as he handed it to her. I had said I would never go back to Chili's three and a half years ago when I was served cold food twice, but at a different location. The only reason we went is because I had a balance on a gift card from that previous visit 3 years ago. Needless to say, we will NEVER set foot in a Chili's again. We will spend our hard earned money at delicious LOCAL restaurants that care about their customers and serve HOT food and intact dishes with amazing service!!","45":"This place is terrible been here a couple times now hoping that my other bad experiences would be fixed, by finally a good one. But no that's not the case. Today will be my last time ever eating here. Their cups and silverware are barely clean, my girlfriend's cup had specs of food in it \u00c2\u00a0thank god she got water so she could see it so they couldn't of covered it up with pepsi or a darker beverage. This place is - excuse my language ass. Service so slow","46":"We just had our first experience ordering from Chili's on Military Road in Niagara Falls using the DoorDash app. While DoorDash seemed to be an excellent service the meal from Chili's was absolutely the worst meal I've had in a long time. My Boneless Chicken Wings were more like eating Boneless Rocks from my driveway. The Queso was,, well I'm not sure what it was. I posted a picture with this review showing the Queso I received and a picture from their website showing the Queso I should have received. I also posted a picture of the Boneless Wings they sent that were not only burnt but hard as a rock and as cold as a winters night. And add to all of this everything was cold. DoorDash evidently follows up with its customers to see if you were happy not only with their service but the food itself. I complain that the meal was terrible so terrible we tossed it in the trash. To DoorDash's credit they immediately issued me a 20 dollar credit but it should be Chili's making it right. Anyways that being said \u00c2\u00a0Chili's on Military Rd in Niagara Falls needs to do a much better job so trash like our meal doesn't leave their restaurant.","47":"Food was good but was not impressed with the waitress. She started out strong but then we barely saw her and had to get up ask the hostess 3 times for help. I pointed to the $5 Marg special and asked what flavors it came in. I was charged $8.29 on my bill and when I inquired she responded with it must have been a misunderstanding and immediately turned around and walked away. Not impressed. We also got charged for a side of fries, that showed up on our table, but no one ordered them or could eat them. The other couple we were with gave their CC to pay their bill, and when she brought the receipt back to sign, the bill was $7 more. It was a long day and already late and since we got the shaft on our first question, we left. Service leaves an impression as much as food","48":"Not only is this the worst Chili's I've ever been to, it's \u00c2\u00a0most likely the worst restaurant I've been to. \u00c2\u00a0Ever. I blame myself, partly because I keep going back and giving them my money despite both the food and service being terrible. \u00c2\u00a0In fairness to the staff, the three occasions all occurred at the bar, ordering take out. \u00c2\u00a0My latest visit will be my last though. \u00c2\u00a0The bartender was too preoccupied talking with her friend at the end of the bar to take my drink order. When I finally got my drink, the glass was only about 3\/4 of the way full. \u00c2\u00a0Whatever, I just wanted some takeout and assumed since there were only three other people at the bar and two other tables in the bar area and they were all eating that my 3\/4 of a beer would be plenty to hold me over until my food was ready. I was wrong. \u00c2\u00a0Almost 45 minutes for chicken tenders and nothing else. \u00c2\u00a0Needless to say, that beer lasted only about 25 minutes and I sat with an empty glass in front of me while the bartender conversed some more with her buddy at the end of the bar, a server or two , and some \u00c2\u00a0red haired fellow I assumed was the manager. \u00c2\u00a0The real disappointment here is that I've been to Chili's all over the country and they're typically well run. \u00c2\u00a0I'm also a little disappointed in myself for returning here after several bad experiences. \u00c2\u00a0Corporate really needs to take a look at this location.","49":"It's really to bad, this used to be a nice clean place, now it's so dirty we were afraid to eat there and had to drive to Lewiston to eat when we were really to tired. Its the same old thing, young kids working there, unsupervised, no standards or work ethics! No common sense. And the kicker was, they were not even busy. They won't be in business long! Lol Guess the Chili's guest engagement team can't read or understand English either? They want me to call them and explain it slower? Clean the place up, its dirty, sticky, floor is dirty, doors are dirty, etc.","50":"We came to watch the Saints game and eat some apps. The food is fine, I mean, it's a Chili's. But... It's dead in here and somehow the service is crazy slow- our waitress just keeps sitting on her ass at the bar, fiddling with her phone. Meanwhile, we've been waiting 10 minutes for a refill on water and a second beer. We've been watching her... sitting there on her phone... not getting our drink orders in.... My husband had to go to the bar to get service. Absolutely unacceptable.","51":"Always passed by this resto when I cross the border to go to the outlets to shop but I never had a chance to try it. Finally did! We came on a Sunday for brunch and it wasn't that busy. We got seated quickly in a booth in the bar area. I really liked the tiles they used for the table, it looked nice. Since it was our first time there it took us forever to decide what we wanted to order. On Sundays they had a $5 special which was 11 pieces of boneless chicken bites or 6-7 wings. It was pretty cheap so we got 2 servings of that with honey chipotle sauce. They used chicken breast for the pieces and the batter was made perfectly for these boneless bites. The honey chipotle sauce was really good too. A little sweet, little sour with a slight hint of spice. I originally wanted a burger but I still wasn't too hungry and wouldn't be able to finish so I got the 3 split appetizer to try which was about the same price as a burger. Of the 3, I got chicken crispers, Mexican spring rolls and burger sliders. The chicken crisper tastes like the boneless bites except chicken tender format. Burger sliders, like your normal burger but smaller. Mexican spring rolls had beans and salsa in it. I actually liked this the most. Was something unusual and new for us and it was flavourful. There were 3 dipping sauces (idk what they were and what you were supposed to dip what with) so I mixed and matched everything. All good! My boyfriend got the fajita mix which was a sizzling plate with veggies, rice, beans, steak slices, chicken slices, and shrimp along with the fajita sides and salsa. That dish was HUGE and he couldn't finish it. As for service, it's a little slow but we had a lot of time that day that we didn't mind. There's so many other things that I wanna try and I would def come back as it's really close to the border from Canada!","52":"My first time ever to a Chili's with my mother and boyfriend as a lunch date I expected some great food and customer service since I been recommended here a few times. Upon arriving I only waited less than 10 minutes which was a plus but was seated very close to the door \u00c2\u00a0but not a big issue. Took our waiter about 15 minutes to actually come take our drink orders and he was friendly and nice. Now this is where it got bad, we ordered our food specifically \u00c2\u00a0not wanting bacon on the sliders and white queso dip. Got the appetizer and it was cheddar queso dip and I let that slide because it was still decent. \u00c2\u00a0Ordering our entree was no hassle yet we had to wave down our waiter everytime we needed a refill on drinks it's like he didn't care to check on us not once and even after getting our dinners he was at other tables and NOT ONCE asked us if our food was okay or anything. Watching other waitresses and waiters attending their tables better than ours was just aggravating. I just wish I had a better customer service experience for my first time because I surely won't be back! Food was good but not worth the poor service!","53":"My daughter and I come here often. We really enjoy dessert which is fabulous as always. It would be nice if their French fry portion was comparable to the picture. Besides that the food is really good.","54":"Went to the outlets and this was nearby so we stopped in for lunch. Got seated right away near a booth by the bar, the server was friendly and quick. Got our food which didn't take long and was good. Overall very good experience will probably be dropping in every time we go the outlets.","55":"I placed an Order of the Bone-in Wings 2 $20.78Buffalo - On SideRanch Dressing - RemoveBleu Cheese DressingThe Boss Burger* 1$14.69No PinkMayonnaiseJalapeno Cheddar Smoked Sausage - RemoveMushroom Swiss Burger*1$11.19No PinkChiliBUT I guess because it was to go no one really cared my boss burger was really pink and my husbands had no flavor he said it was very bland. This is a go into only DO NOT I repeat DO NOT ORDER OFF LINE.","56":"We left Applebees due to NO service to go here. \u00c2\u00a0Our waitress was amazing! \u00c2\u00a0She made our experience 100% and we had great food! I would recommend them 100%","57":"This review is long overdue. Wanted to rave about one of my favourite places in Orchard Road, but just didn't get to do it till now (excuses I know hahahahah). So, here's the story. Celebrated my birthday at this cafe in May this year with my gal friends. 4 of us ordered a few mains and a dessert to share. I gotta say we were all very happy with the food. I especially love the 2 main dishes: Fuwa Fuwa Hoshino Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Porcini Rissoto Tomato Cream and Omu Rice with Shrimp & Mozarella. Just writing about them and looking at their yelp pictures are making me hungry now. Their dessert item, Double Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 Style is also recommended. It is so big I am sure it can feed 8 instead of the 4 of us. Love the service here! Definitely one of the few places in SG where you can enjoy good and cheery service at a mid-priced eatery. Good service is just super hard to find in SG #sadfactoflife.I have been coming to this cafe chain over the years. My favourite outlet is still this Plaza Singapura one. After writing this review, I have the urge to visit it soon. Think I gotta make it real soon. #whydoeswritingreviewsmakeonehungry?","58":"Came here for the coffee on a weekday afternoon with my friend. The coffee was pretty decent, I really enjoyed my iced coffee float :DThe ambience is pretty nice for a late afternoon chill time since the place is not too crowded. The service is decent and they provide baskets to put your bag in.Would love to come back again for a proper meal!","59":"Stopped by for a quick coffee break at Hoshino Coffee as it was close by and we were too lazy to go around hunting elsewhere. There was no queue so we were able to grab a seat quick!Hoshino Coffee is an open air cafe in the middle of Plaza Singapura (or Plaza Sing, for short). We were seated and greeted quickly by our host & waitress. The booths were nice to sit in, was comfy and soft.There is a button at the side of the table, allowing you to call the waitress - which is similar to some Korean restaurants here in Toronto. I find this method extremely effective because I don't have to waste time flagging down a server.We ordered the Hoshino Coffee as it seemed to be the special food item which was \"roasted over open fire, gives a strong boiled flavour with pleasant sourness\". Coffee was alright to me, but it was really rich - kind of reminds me of the French Roast from Starbucks.I wanted the Matcha latte but decided not to get it after looking at the price. $9 for either hot or iced matcha latte is pure daylight robbery to me!! Unless it was going to be served in a big cup... which I highly doubt. Hoshino Coffee, served with a tiny bit of milkWe also got the pancake souffle style with strawberry, which was on their spring recommendations page. The presentation was super cute as strawberries have this special talent of adding an oomf to every dish! With syrup drizzled on the outer edges and strawberry jam drizzled on top, with ice cream on the side... it looked really appetizing.Unfortunately, I feel like it isn't that special for the price. The pancake souffle just tastes like a really thick version of a pancake... nothing special. I personally felt that the ice cream was a tad small. The strawberries tasted fresh and sweet.IAlso to mention that I rarely saw waiters\/waitresses walking around after ordering... Barely any of them walked about and only seen when they're bringing out food or drinks. Had to call the waitress using the button just to get my water refilled... which was an odd feeling to me.All in all, it was just okay at Hoshino Coffee. I feel like it's a tad expensive for what they offer because I don't find anything unique about the place for that pricing.","60":"1 star each for the 5 things that make it for me. (Service, cleanliness, food, price and \"will I come back?\"). This place hits all five. FIVE STARS!Service was good, attentive and non-intrusive. I asked about the iced-coffee and the server was able to explain everything AND accommodate my special request. No fuss!The restaurant was clean and well-kept. The menu was small, but had pictures for most, so can't go wrong there. Gordon Ramsey will have a fit, I'm sure. \"NO PHOTOS IN YOUR MENU, ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING?\" he'd yell. But me, I like to see a preview of what I'm ordering. By the way, since this is a Japanese coffee shop, there is a huge display of waxed facsimiles of most of the food available for you to ooh and ahh over.Souffles! Savoury and sweet souffles! Pancakes of incredible thickness, but fluffy and light like a... souffle! Each pancake is almost 2 inches thick! The french toast was also very good. I had a savoury souffle, and even though it was topped with a huge souffle, the dish was not heavy at all.Price was slightly high for some items, but reasonable for others. The coffee items have a refill option of $3 or so. Will I come back? Yes, please!","61":"I passed by this cafe many times and it was only until yesterday I finally get my first taste with a fellow yelper. The wait (20 minutes) was killing me but it was certainly worth it. Because my friend told me she probably won't be able to finish her portion, so we decided to share and trust me the mouthfuls of pancake I had (Chocolate Banana) wasn't enough to satisfy my stomach. I was tempted to order another one but eventually I didn't since the sweet mango drink I had was enough for my tummy for that evening and that's how good it was. I didn't understand why the wait was so long but I glad I waited, it's one of the better places for pancakes. Soft and tasty is what I \u00c2\u00a0remember from my few bites. Another thing is both of us seemed to be competing with one another to see who gets more bites of it. I ate it so quickly that I forget the primary rule of eating, that is to enjoy it slowly. I will order my own share the next time I come back. Good food means the staff will see more of me!! *evil grin* The mango smoothie was nice, not too sweet like some other places and it went well with the cake. Overall, this is in my list of recommendation especially coming from a big fan of the Land of the Rising Sun!","62":"Located on the third floor extension of Plaza Singapura, is Hoshino Coffee, a popular Japanese chain of coffee shop. I wanted to try this so badly at Shibuya but time did not allow. So back here in Singapore, I decided to go all out and try it!! 7 souffl\u00c3\u00a9s ordered and here goes my personal souffl\u00c3\u00a9 buffet!! \"Gotta catch em all!\"Now that is supposedly Spring in Japan, even though my Japanese friends told me it snowed last week and it's currently 6 degrees celsius in Tokyo, the Spring menu for Hoshino coffee includes this super pretty pink \u00c2\u00a0strawberry souffl\u00c3\u00a9 pancake!1. Hoshino's Spring Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 $14.50++So after the waitress took our 7 orders of souffl\u00c3\u00a9s, all the 4 pancakes arrived at all table all at once! The strawberry ice cream was very smooth, it wasn't too sweet but the syrup they provided us was very sweet indeed! Use it sparingly over the souffl\u00c3\u00a9, as it can drown out your taste buds and we had 6 more souffl\u00c3\u00a9s to try and we didn't want to kill our taste buds. The souffl\u00c3\u00a9 itself is alot harder than the normally fluffly souffl\u00c3\u00a9. As it is a pancake, I would consider it more like a fluffier and slightly tougher version of a chiffon cake.2. Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Chocolate Banana $13.50++Lots of chocolate sauce going on here. When you order a pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9, you have an option of whipped cream of softee. We went with softee for all our pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9s and we liked the softee. Japanese soft serves, you can never go wrong with them! The pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9 don't have any fillings inside, unlike the hot vanilla souffl\u00c3\u00a9s.3. Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Mango $13.50++We decided to go easy on the syrup for this one, having tried the first Spring souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with syrup and the second one with alot of chocolate sauce. The softee itself isn't very sweet, as such you can taste the subtle sweetness of the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 pancake!4. Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Matcha \"Ogura\" Bean Paste $13.50++The most modest of the pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9s, and my personal favourite. The matcha soft cream here tastes very similar to the one I tried at Tsujiri, it has a stronger bitter after taste than the typical sweet and sugar-ladden matcha ice cream. The bean paste is also very sweet, as such, be careful not to get a sugar-overdose trying to eat that on it's own! 5. Vanilla Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Chocolate\/Custard\/Matcha sauce $10.80++ eachAll the vanilla souffl\u00c3\u00a9s arrived at our table just as we were done with the pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9!You gotta pour the sauces into the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 and the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 was steaming hot as we sliced it open, and even as we dug in, each spoonful, you could still see it steaming!! It is a very hot dessert, and be careful not to burn your tongue!Of the 3 sauces, my favourite was custard. It had the right amount of sweetness! The chocolate was abit too sweet for my liking and the green tea wasn't sweet at all!and here's the bill for our exploration of 7 souffl\u00c3\u00a9s at Hoshino coffee!!Service is pretty good here, there's a button for your to press and the waitress will come to you. The also provide you with a bag to put your things.","63":"The initial wait was reasonable. Around 15 mins. Waiting for the food was abit slower. Service was kinda average. They had service bell on the table but they were kinda useless. It is much faster raising your hands and getting service. The service staff serving our table had limited knowledge of English so asking her questions like 'do you sell the coffee beans' needed another staff to help. Food wise it was a hit and miss. I had the demi-glac\u00c3\u00a9 omu rice. The sauce was decent but the proportion of the rice to the sauce was inbalanced. I think they should give more sauce or reduce the size of the dish. The dessert was a letdown. I had the creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e. The dessert was not made on the spot since the crust sugar was cold on taste. Price wise I find it a tad expensive.","64":"Very disappointing... the pancake was dry and the egg omelette is nothing special.. sakura and matcha latte was bland and too milky.. not much flavor..","65":"Curious about the line so did what typical Singaporean do - Q. \u00c2\u00a0We got the choc ganache pancake souffle and we thought it was good. \u00c2\u00a0The pancake is fluffy and soft which is very typical of japanese bakery. The ganache though was not that smooth but overall it turns out ok. \u00c2\u00a0Sadly the coffees are not that great. \u00c2\u00a0Not sure about the food so won't comment.","66":"Great! Loved my matcha latte. Most places do it too milky and too sweet, I like mine with more matcha taste and this place is perfect.The souffl\u00c3\u00a9 were great. While not the fluffiest and lightest that I gave tasted, it is still really yummy. I tried both the matcha and pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9.As we were leaving, the dinner crowd started and we saw many orders of the blank squid ink pasta. Guess I know what to order on my next visit!","67":"The Food1. Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle ($15.80) \u00c2\u00a0- My favorite! I tried this based on Angeline C's recommendation and she was right on spot. This was definitely a unique dish. It has an amazing, light scrambled-eggs-buttery flavor. My only complain would be there was too little meat in it (barely half a dozen small sausage cubes). 2. Omelette rice with beef sauce - Average. 3. Matcha souffle with softie ice-cream - I love the souffle but it was a bit wet towards the end when I got to the bottom of the bowl. Also, I would have preferred a stronger match flavor. The softie ice-cream was all melted and running when they served it which was a let down. 4. Pancake souffle - It tasted more like a sponge cake than a souffle but it was still worth a try. Interesting concept for a pancake. 5. Hoshino Pot Baked Curry Rice - served with eggs (a little more undercooked than the typical sunny-side up style), sausage and some brocoli. Good. I like the way the egg was wet & runny :) They were more generous with the sausage helpings in this dish too. I think I saw a full sausage. Overall, an interesting japanese fusion restaurant. I like the creative concepts of mixing up dishes like the pancake-souffle and the \u00c2\u00a0Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle (which was like a savory souffle crossed with baked rice). I don't think I've tried this anywhere else so definitely worth a check out :) The queue gets pretty crazy at dinner time. Best to come \u00c2\u00a0before the dinner crowd (6.30pm should be safe).","68":"It's at least a 15 minute wait for a seat. And go with a person if you really want to try it. If you're alone, they prolly make you wait till there's a single table available even if there's a booth empty. Apparently the barista got me a booth and got himself a scolding from the waitress (aunties; can't expect must from them)The service I must say is freaking lousy. The bell works perfectly fine, but they just don't come. Too busy I guess? But so many of them were talking amongst themselves without paying attention. Or should there be a better system to serve the customers?I hope the food would at least wow me so I may not give a negative feedback about this place.People watching is fun here though. Because it's crowded, the patrons do not suspect you staring at them. I do love the secrecy of this. And they kind of just release who they are from inside. If you're sitting at a booth, you can even watch people in other restaurants from other levels having food and what not.Food wise. Well done. I loved it a lot. The cream sauce in the carbonara dish wasn't that thick that would stick to your tongue and even if it does after a few mouths, drinking a small sip of water would clear it up mostly.","69":"-casual, open air cafe in atrium setting, get a booth seating-hand dripped coffee is headlined, so one has to try. Happy to say it is a lovely, concentrated cup of coffee with a rich, full bodied roast. I'm a fan of the taste of coffee, I just don't want to consume a whole soup bowl's worth. -lots of small, subtle touches that make the dining experience very enjoyable and, dare I say, Japanese. Ex. Baskets provided for your handbag, individual minijugs of cream and sugar syrup-rare instance that I don't see often enough in Singapore; all the dishes arrived together, so we all eat at the same time. Why can't more places do this?-shrimp, avocado and egg sandwich. Onions hidden inside which gives the sandwich a nice, subtle kick. The shrimp were nice and juicy. Great snack to have with coffee-enjoyed the experience so much so, we extended the coffee into lunch and ordered pasta (spaghetti w\/ eggplant, bacon, shimeji & sausage; carbonara w\/ yolk & bacon) and rice (Demi glace 'Omu' rice w\/ mozzarella)-well prepared Japanese style pasta, that is scrumptious. -the western styled omelette rice was ok. You have to appreciate ketchup. Not that it was overwhelming, but it was very much there in every bite. The light, fluffy egg and half glaze couldn't balance out the tomato sweetness. -overall a delightful experience, can't wait to come back and try other dishes","70":"The curry rice is definitely better than the fuwa-fuwa. Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 is nice. I can't really tell if the coffee is good. I'm an espresso drinker. It's a nice place. Like it. 10% service fee but hey, why I have to get up to pay for the bill ? Haha stupid","71":"The coffee is really good. No doubt.However, after waiting for 15mins to get in (when there were several empty tables), I was told they don't have thick pancake, so I ordered souffl\u00c3\u00a9 instead. Guess how long I waited? More than 50 minutes! For the freaking souffl\u00c3\u00a9!! Unbelievable!!!","72":"Desert quite yucky. The pasta is ok and the coffee is normal, but sell at Starbucks pricing.","73":"This place is odd. It is like they are trying to create a quaint Japanese-style Western ambiance like Maison but in the middle of an open floor of a mall, so it seems out of place.$6 for the coffee is steep. The matcha green tea latte with ice cream was good, but there wasn't much ice cream because it was resting on big cubes of ice which went almost to the top of the cup. I would ask for it with no ice if I go back. These drinks were decent but in my opinion it would not have been worth waiting in the nearly omnipresent queue for them.","74":"You know it's Japanese - the waiters all dressed up spiffily in that old-school 'western' vest suit ensemble, woody earthy paneling... I didn't have coffee but ordered the chocolate lava cake which was quite diving, warm and oozy and went well with the soft vanilla ice cream. Tried some of the green tea souffle as well which I enjoyed surprisingly - not a big fan of green tea but this one was not overly-teaish in taste and the souffle was of a good texture.","75":"Hoshino Coffee's casual vibe, trendy fare and wallet-friendly price points have made it a hit among the teenybopper set and the broke-by-the-end-of-the-month types.I suggest getting the eggy souffle baked rice and although the menu alleges this as \"rissoto\", it is really a term used loosely, and more regular Japanese rice than Italian risotto:1) Omu Souffle ($16.80): tomato rice casserole dotted with broccoli and shrimp.2) Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle ($15.80): with mushrooms and ham bits 3) Matcha Souffle ($10.80): semi-collapsed by the time it got to our table. This was disappointing, and I much rather spent a few dollars more and get the fabulous ones at Laurent Bernard.4) Ice Matcha Latte with Softee ($9.30): rich and robust. Much better than the souffle as a sweet finisher","76":"Seriously good! U wouldn't believe that the queue speaks for itself. I'd thought, well, it could be that people are simply curious about what this 2 week's old is capable of. And when the line starts to form, more people just keep queuing without a single complain. It was a late lunch thingy after a movie show, I make my way to this little cafe joint speedily. This is like crazy, the snaking line - almost a L-shaped by now is still around. I have seen the same this morning at 11.10m (the outlet only open at 11.30am!) when I drop by to ask if I could make a reservation for 3pm but was turned down politely, which now I clearly understand why. I know this is what I have to eat despite still nursing my throat discomfort & joined the queue - determined to know if they are as good as they claimed.The interior is not entirely small but having a 3 separate dining space. The main hall sits most of the diners with wooden table and leather padded seats. It emits a brighter and casual feel, probably the area is not constraint by a stiff ceiling but an architectural glass rooftop in the mall that illuminates the stretch with a natural glow of sunlight. There are 4 booth seats which is most ideal for a gals-get-together session, I figured. The menu was straight forward, without fanciful hard to understand dishes. Zoom right into my orders and wave for the staff, the lady clad in chef suit came to me (gosh, even one works in the kitchen has to take time to manage the hall during peak hours?).. aw.. but she was very well-mannered and patient when confronted with inquiries. In fact, no one was seen idling - all the wait person served with pride, promptly and in an unhurried manner. A remarkable service team.I admit I felt a little uneasy when I picked that unfamiliar dish - Fuwa Fuwa. But the truth tells me that feeling has been unwarranted.The most raved about \u00c2\u00a0\"fluffy savory souffl\u00c3\u00a9\" seriously did not put to shame. Not only that it enticed me with its huge golden puffy bonnet but I was completely sold by its astonishing delicate flavors \u00c2\u00a0This is one dish I wish I had on my last - cottony & airy, formidable without a trace of deflating. It is no wonder that people called it the \"cloud\", but I think it's me that's on Cloud 9 at every bite. Instead of baking it like an Italian classic with white sauce, this one has a tomato version in it. It was filled with incredible moments - spooning the whites like a mass destruction into that light feathery foam, trespassing to get to the bed of the baking dish. The gems hidden under these soft foams have never been so right. Tomato sauce infused - each grain was plump, tangy-sweet, not soggy. Its flavor was enhanced by strips of middle eye bacon and mushroom bits. Together with that eggy, Parmesan cheese souffl\u00c3\u00a9, a divine marriage left unchallenged by the sweet version. Impossible not to eat, I think I can have 1 on every other day. A couple of spaghetti dishes if you like, other than \"Omu\" rice (omelette rice) or sandwiches. I had the Lobster Bisque Soup Spaghetti. A french dish but cooked the Japanese way for a lighter taste. Instead of highly seasoned, this one prepared with tomato and finely chopped mushrooms comes with a milder liquidized cream but rich crustaceans flavor. I find the soup a little offensive (even while its still steaming hot) while my dining partner finds it delicious, so I guess it's a mixed conclusion. It was not entirely bad - at least the spaghetti is cooked the correct way, I guess I just didn't have the mood for such a sophisticated seafood thing today.String along with others, I ordered a pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9, this time a more familiar sweet version! Not the plain ones but a more elaborate classic with a tropical touch. I have been advised to remind the kitchen to start preparing the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 when I was half way into my main course. It was like taking a number queue to a souffl\u00c3\u00a9! I was asked to wait for another 15mins by the apologetic service staff. Not an issue at all, I said to myself because the end result was a light and airy inflated sponge that was unforgettable. The only negative I had was the fruits. Upon checking, I learnt that frozen mango fruits are used while the kiwi are fresh produces. I'd prefer ripened fruits atop my dessert, not raw and crunchy. Worst, the mango has a weird over-frozen texture makes them taste rubbery. However, the homemade whipped cream was smooth. And pls do not leave the place without a cup of Hoshino blend.Whaff that strong Hoshino caffeine scent right in front of me - that was one of the distinct characteristic while waiting in line. Carefully selected coffee beans were roasted over direct flame and then hand drip to a good-bodied brew. The blend has got a rather pale flavor \u00c2\u00a0less rich as compared to Oriole's. Milder acidity but has a lingering smell. I guess the Japanese adores this light perfumery beverage. I am good for that 10g but if anyone wanted an extra brew, there is a 50% off for a refill.","77":"While the seating isn't the greatest, the coffee is outstanding and the food is delicious. Grab a table and place your order at the counter when you're ready. Eggs & toast was SG$10 which seemed reasonable (for the area). The avocado toast was an absolute mountain of avocado!I really loved my latte (for the first time in Singapore) - finally one that wasn't overly bitter. Melbourne folks continue to meet the stereotype of being coffee experts. We also had a vanilla-Nutella milkshake. I was a little surprised that it was watery like milk (instead of thick like american shakes) but it was still super tasty!Free wifi - just ask for the code.","78":"Cute little cafe hidden away in bouna vista's industrial area. Chill ambiance and a quite little book corner gives you the perfect chill. Yummy pork hash and great all day breakfast!!","79":"Walked in greeted and felt welcome. Menu changed a little from some of the postings. \u00c2\u00a0The eggs were great and service was fast. \u00c2\u00a0 I wish I had know about this place the food so much better than the hotel","80":"If you're after some Melbourne style coffee and food, then this is the place for you. It can get fairly busy during lunch time on the weekends though.","81":"Located at the ground of a block of private housing is this tiny cafe. The dine in area was limited. Menu was a simple clip board, some sliced cakes on the display shelf. Although it was air-con indoor, we could barely feel the air-con, so we did try to adjust the standing fan next to us.MochaThe drink was quite rich and thick, but not enough coffee taste.Carrot cakeQuite a huge silce but I would prefer it to be more moist.Dom Pedro ($18)Fresh Milk, Vanilla Ice-Cream + Black Nikka WhiskyIt looked just like another plain vanilla milkshake. In just a single taste, I could feel the heat of the alcohol down my throat. Feeling high fast. It was rather strong drink to have.Overall the drinks were great. But in the warm dine in area, one tended to feel sleepy easily.","82":"I've been here a few times since I discovered Jimmy Monkey. Each time for breakfast on the weekend. Grab a menu and order at the counter, then the wait staff will bring out the food. The coffee is excellent, and I love the vibe of the place. The staff is friendly and attentive. Yes, the food is a little price-y, but not too far out of range for this kind of place. My favorite so far is the hash. Just a little bit of spice and just satisfying enough for brunch.","83":"A quaint place with a really interesting design.Perfect for a catch-up with buddies over a cup of coffee instead of hustling in town.There were books in the bathroom and a rubix cube too. HAHA","84":"Cool, little nook with compact seating, 9 tables and 2 benches. Industrial, 3 levels exposed which must be helping to absorb all the sound. A plus in my book compared to other places that look \u00c3\u00bcber cool, but once seated is a cacophony, reveberated in a too enclosed space. Becomes quite a hub of activity on a sunday morning. A mix of residences nearby, young families, partners for brunch. If u need only the caffeine fix, JM Too is across the pathway and have the new Slayers.\u00c2\u00a0On to the food. Simple menu, doesn't offer everything under the Suns. The small things make a difference. Like mesclun salad over iceberg lettuce, ripe avacados, fresh ciabatta. Price point are on the higher side, but I'm finding that across the island these days. Portions are ample and generous. Quality and freshness on the ingredients. You don't get a 'that's it!?' reaction when the plate is served.\u00c2\u00a0And lastly the coffee never misses. Very much recommended.","85":"Jimmy Monkey came highly recommended for its coffee and that was the main reason behind my visit to this off location. The space sort of screams hipster in name, design and look of the staff. That is not necessarily a bad thing as it often can deliver some good food and beverages.The coffee was pretty good and clearly better than any random place but still not really impressive wither. If it would have been around the corner I could have visited again but not at all worth traveling this far for. Also had a decent brekkie muffin and a pasta with mushrooms. Not bad but also a bit overpriced.What was however a pleasant surprise was that the staff were friendly and helpful. Service was also smooth and fast despite the place being packed.","86":"Great coffee and good quality food. Deducting one star for the location \u00c2\u00a0(quite a walk from the nearest mrt station) and one star for the price (you leave wondering if you really got what you paid for). Definitely not a place you'll pass by unless you make an intentional effort to visit it. May or may not come back","87":"At this point, I'm no longer shocked by prices in this part of town. Anywhere in one north is almost exclusively catering for ex-pats and high-income locals. Jimmy Monkey is no different. Egg's Benedict will run you a whopping $24, pancakes are $14, and the french toast is $17.They had run out of pancakes on a Sunday at noon so I went with the french toast, and added on a chocolate, peanut butter, speculoos shake for good measure. This was not a wallet-friendly brunch but I was happily surprised by how tasty everything was. The french toast comes in a healthy serving, and includes berries and cr\u00c3\u00a8me fra\u00c3\u00aeche. By the end I was actually struggling to finish my serving because everything was so sweet.I wouldn't be opposed to returning but this place is definitely a treat, and not a joint for regular meals. Seating is fairly limited, but somehow sufficient for the number of patrons. It gets a little warm, and the space does feel a little cramped. Nonetheless there are a variety of seating options depending on what you're up to.","88":"I googled for free-wifi AND power plugs and found this place. What's lovely about it is you can manage to comfortably get lounge seats on a weekend evening. And there's no queue, not much of a crowd throughout the night. Yes, it's QUIET. A rare gem I would say.I also really admire the fact I could drink coffee, look up and there you are, a TOILET BOWL complete with toilet paper right above my head. It's so randomly ridiculous yet genius that I LURVE IT. I even took a picture of it, go see.I ordered the banana bread pudding, - $14, and coffee. The presentation of the bread pudding was very cute, it came in a pot, on a wooden slab. Coffee was better than most cafes I've been to, and service was... Let's just say that they let you do your own thing, and they do theirs, and if both lines should intersect, colourful unicorns will bloom. Pricing is on the high side.One thing that made me feel like getting up to leave, was the glaring red neon lighting fixture, that engulfed me and my companion. It reminded me of an episode in Seinfeld (who else still watches this?!) where Kramer's entire room emitted a red glow because Kenny Rogers moved opposite his room and their crazy signboard faced his window.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.","89":"I'll just get this out of the way first. I'm probably one of five people in the world that doesn't drink coffee. I know how to grind beans and make coffee in a french press for my mum, I love the smell of coffee brewing and when it pops up in savory food and sweets...but I just hate the taste of coffee as a drink. No matter how much milk, sugar, nothing, best beans, kona beans, any beans, my man has tried to get me to drink it and the most I've tolerated is 2 sips. The one time I drank a caramel latte in Japan because I totally misread the menu, it was really sweet and suddenly I was talking non-stop for an hour. Since this IS a coffee joint, my dude has his two cents in this review. He had a decaf black and in his words \"it's wonderful. very smooth\". So there.Now on to the food. We're really brunch people so we were looking for food more than coffee. When I say I'm a brunch person it's not because I like to dress up to eat a meal I can cook at home. I'm actually a hungry person, I like brunch foods and someone always wakes up too late to fire up the pan. Anyway, we had the french toast and a breakfast sandwich (can't remember the exact name) and both were pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0My french toast was made of 3 thick slices of brioche sliced up, drizzled with a caramel sauce with bananas and nuts drizzled over. It was beautiful to see and a hearty portion for my rumbling tummy. Here's the problem: the egg wash wasn't soaked through the bread. Whhhhhhhhy? It would've been perfect otherwise. If there's a monkey jimmy listening - please soak the toast, turn the heat low and cook that baby.The breakfast sandwich was a standout. A generous, fluffy omelet sandwiched between avocado slices, ciabatta and a sweet-ish tomato chutney. It was brilliant, huge and I would eat it again. And again. So that's a winner right there.What didn't I like? The guys on shift probably partied until 4am and decided to bring their music to work. Bad trance music in a coffee shop is just wrong. Especially at 2pm on a Saturday. That gave me a headache and I shouldn't be getting one at a place where there's a toilet bowl watching me eat.","90":"4-stars only for the coffee.I normally order a flat white or cappuccino here. They have a Slayer(tm) coffee machine and do their shots right.Come here only for the coffee. For dessert, you're better off wandering over to Rochester or Star Vista.","91":"Coffee was good, food was decent. Portions were slightly too small. Service was spotty although staff were sincere.Prices could have been slightly lower, especially given the location.","92":"This is one of my favorite tucked-away places to go. The coffee is flavorful & beautifully prepared with a delicious little biscotti that I can't get enough of. The food is delicious and uncomplicated. The staff is friendly and unpretentious. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Free wifi if you need it. Quirky & clever little bits all around to show you that the proprietor & his staff enjoy what they do.","93":"They neither serve Jimmy nor Monkeys.... But for a quant place to grab a smoothie or cup of coffee and a light bite this might be a good stop. \u00c2\u00a0 Tried the pulled pork sandwich on a buttered bun served with potatoes lyonnaise and also tried the tartine called \"the hulk\" - open face rustic bread sandwich covered in avocado and feta served on a bed of arugula. \u00c2\u00a0The banana-strawberry smoothie was \"nice\" (says the SPG) and the mocha was delightful!","94":"I love this place for its quaint-ness. Out of the place (a short walk from One North MRT) but convenient if you have a car.Good place to chill out on a weekend afternoon but it might be a bit crowded to get some reading done.Absolutely love the washrooms as it was decorated so beautifully with bookshelves (my absolute dream intention to my own bathroom) with books and cards!","95":"Imagine a hipster cafe with above average prices and decidedly average food.Congratulations, you've successfully imagined Jimmy Monkey Cafe & Bar.In all seriousness, I found the food to be decent but not worth raving about or coming back for. \u00c2\u00a0It seemed as though JMC&B was trying to get that Saturday morning breakfast cafe feel, like the ones that you'd find by the beach in California or Hawaii, but they fell a bit short. \u00c2\u00a0If they're going to charge the prices they do, I feel there should be something special that sets them at least a little bit apart, but I didn't think there was anything that special here.Last mark against them is the lack of space. \u00c2\u00a0JMC&B feels very cramped, as we were slotted into what felt like a tiny corner of a wooden shack.","96":"Espresso - this was a potent, robust and strong shot with a lingering aftertaste, but also a good balance of taste and flavours. This is not surprising - Jimmy Monkey's Ironbark blend is a combination of beans from Brazil (Cerrado), Papua New Guinea (Sigri), Columbia (Kachru), Guatamala (La Laguna) and Peru (Amazonas). There is also a Columbian single origin blend available, which works well in pourover coffee. Each bean variety contributes something unique to the shot - hints of citrus, and even some chocolate notes. Ironbark is a blend that is still evolving, and is now on it's third iteration. The experimentation has paid off, leaving a full bodied shot with a lingering aftertaste.The cappuccino that I ordered was notable for the initial strong hit of coffee flavour, complemented by smooth, light foam and finished with well executed latte art. The microbubbles in the foam add the smooth, silky mouthfeel that I look for, and is seen in quality cafes. This is where Ironbark is used to good effect - the lingering aftertaste is a strong base for a milk based drink, ensuring that the fundamental coffee character is retained.I had a Piccolo also, which is characterised by a more robust coffee taste, with the aftertaste lasting through the milk and foam. The milk complements the robust coffee flavour, smoothing it but not smothering it, creating a hybrid which retains the best characteristics of each - its just right and well executed. Their original place in the piccolo latte hall of fame post is deserved, and retained. There are also pourover, syphon and chemex coffees available. This is a good choice for anyone in the West of the island, and worth a quick trip on the MRT for coffee lovers elsewhere.","97":"Catfish and rice ($22++) - 3.5 starsThe catfish was a little like fish and chips! Some bits of the rice tasted a little funky but overall not bad. Good amount of salad.Jambalaya pasta ($22++) - 3 starsThe snapper tasted a little fishy.3P burger ($24++) - 4 starsStole some of my friend's. Pretty good pulled pork!Ambience - 5 starsOverall, a cosy place but I was most impressed by the sound system and the open mic on Thursday. We made reservations (easily done through Chope) and got seats right by the stage and even then it never sounded too loud or scratchy. You can hear the singers from outside as well.","98":"Order the chicken and waffles but the chicken was undercooked. Great selection of spirits. I tried a random moonshine they made on site by recommendation of the bartender.","99":"We came here for YUBE (Yelp Unofficial Brunch Event) and as there were 10 of us. and we were like-minded, we ordered all the 8 mains in the brunch menu to share. I must confess I got lost after a while as some dishes seemed a bit similar, especially those with biscuits. But what I had and remembered was pretty good. I do love the mac and cheese burger. The mac and cheese was beautifully done with just the right amount of cheese to hold the macaroni together to make it as the \"bun\". The chicken and waffle was unfortunately, quite forgettable. I did like the bourbon maple butter sauce though. I liked the hash brown in the duck hash, and the steak was decent in the steak and egg though it did not look that pretty. Pulled pork hash and Dutch baby pancakes were equally yummy. The service was pretty awesome and very accommodating. We were a noisy bunch on the 2nd level which was thankfully powered with strong air conditioning. It was quite warm on the ground level. Washrooms are also on the ground floor. I will be back for more mac and cheese burger, and I will not be sharing that next time! Well, maybe with just one person but not a big group. It was that good to me.","100":"Love this place, the owner Jamie is awesome!!! Great place to chill and have a few beers with friends. \u00c2\u00a0Great beer selection. The burgers are great as well you will not leave hungry!","101":"Yep Yep ...... I'm back here again I spend my Sunday afternoon dating fellow yelper Carolyn as we are both craving for the Mac Cheese Burger since the last YUBE I attended.The 1st time I visted we are seated at the level 2 of the restaurant and we order quite a big variety of food.This is my 2nd visit to The Beast, this restaurant was located at the corner near jalan klapa road which was near to the main road. This time we were seated at level 1 indoor. It's a little squeezy and there aren't much table maybe because they have outdoor seating too.The serving was fast and both of us order the same dish Mac Cheese Burger which is super cheesy and yummy. Once you cut it the cheese just ooze out. The Mac Cheese patties was near to a inch thick and it's accompanied by lettuce, tomato and a thick beef patty. The combination was so well for us. We paid $26.00 for it and I guess I'm cheese overloadThe place serve all day brunch and it seems that the dinner menu is awesome too. Thumps up for the good service by the crew. You guys did a great job.Need to book in my calender for the next dinner date to try on the rest of the menu which they offer.","102":"To improve - customer service on taking reservation. Made reservation in the afternoon for 2pax @ 7pm. However due to bad traffic, we can only make it at around 7.30pm. Called the beast to make changes, sadly they did not took my reservation in the afternoon and ended up allocated us outdoor (given singapore's humid weather) instead due to overwhelming reservation. Food - chicken waffle. Chicken was so damn good, skin was crispy and meat was tender. but waffles is abit on the salty side, actually I was expecting something sweet on the waffle. But I think it's base on individual preference. Truffle fries and chicken wings were average. Beast Caesar salad can be improved coz it taste kinda meh.Environment - haven't tried their indoor. But outdoor is still quite doable with (live) music playing. As this is the \"dengue\" month, it's advisable to bring insect repellant along. Coz that's what I saw patron from the table beside us brought.Waitresses - although we are assign to sit outside, the service is still quite prompt. Manage to chat up with their friendly waitresses while they were clearing the plates. Price - a little bit pricey, $170 for 2pax.Overall, it's still worth a try.","103":"You can't miss this! Coming along Victoria St.The Beast is a pretty small shop, with a long perimeter which they use to expand their seating area. So don't expect to be seated in an air-conditioned cafe.The interior only has bar top seating.Here's their sunday brunch menu.1. Bacon Maple Donut $5I was really looking forward to this, even though this sounded so sinful. It arrived on a plate with strawberries, which were quite sour. The bacon on the top, being drenched in maple syrup tasted like bak kwa. I quite liked it. But as you bite into the donut, this is where the disappointment hits you.It felt like I was biting into a very hard piece of cardboard. It was so hard, this donut was fried for too long and it just wasn't nice. This was quite saddening, as I had high hopes for this.2. Fried Chicken and Waffle $20Having tried other chicken and waffles offering in Singapore, everyone told me to try this one out as it was the most authentic? Having lived in the US for a few years. Nothing about this strikes me as authentic. Where's the coleslaw? Okay, at least the syrup is still here with the chicken! The waffle looked so pale, when it first arrived I had thought of asking them to heat it in the waffle iron longer? The waffle looked so white!The chicken was crispy and succulent. We had a choice between thigh and breast meat. We went for the thigh which was their more popular choice. The waffle was too light and airy, it felt like you were biting into air pocket. It was not crispy at all. Another total disappointment. This is by far the worst waffle I had every had.I felt like I had wasted my time coming here, there's way better options in Bukit Ho Swee and Dhoby Ghaut!","104":"American Southern food!Southern, refers to the states in the south-east of the United States, where they have a unique set of cuisine from the rest of the US. Ask anyone who's walked into McD's and seen sweet tea on the menu or eaten at Waffle House.I lived for a number of years in ATL, and was here with a couple of friends (one of them hails from Atlanta) and the food passed the test. We went straight for the fried chicken, burgers and pork collar.The fried chicken and gravy is good. Moist on the inside, even the breast meat was tender. I found it a little too brown for my liking (perhaps due to the oil being too long in the fryer?) The gravy is also good without being salty. The biscuit was okay but not particularly fluffy. Waffle is crisp and not soggy. The burger patty is also done to your specifications (medium\/medium-rare if you ask for it).For dessert, we had the pecan pie and the bacon waffle sundae. Both good, and pretty close to what you can get in Georgia. Overall, decently good by Singapore standards, but obviously not the best or most authentic when compared to Southern food in 'merica. They also have a good collection of hard-to-find American craft beers. I was looking for Stone IPA, but it was sold out that evening. Looking forward to try a couple of favorites next time.The only thing I didn't see was fried okra and fried green tomatoes. I thought I'd never ever find proper Southern fare here in Singapore. But here it is, and it's fairly good (though not 100% authentic). Paula Deen would be proud. This place is legit, and I'm coming back.","105":"We went to The Beast on a Friday night. It wasn't too crowded and the atmosphere was very conducive for winding down at the end of the week - the low lights, music and low chatter of the other guests lulling you into a calm state.We had the truffle fries, bacon mac n cheese, buffalo wings and fried chicken, along with some beer and lemonade. The truffle fries were average, I think - hot and crispy with a hint of truffle aroma that disappeared fairly quickly. I was more interested in the \u00c2\u00a0mac n cheese. It was great, not the run of the mill type. The serving was small, but it was meant to be an appetiser anyway. There was a certain depth to the flavour of the cheese - either from the bacon or from adding some blue cheese into the sauce. Whatever it was, it kept me wanting more.The fried chicken was just that - fried chicken. It was not as greasy as those from fast food places, but the flavour was nothing unique. The gravy that came with it was nice though. I was quite disappointed with the buffalo wings. They were just fried chicken with hot sauce poured on top. Buffalo wings are supposed to be baked\/roasted with the sauce, but I doubt this one was. There were clearly areas on the wings that were untouched by the sauce and the flavour hadn't permeated into the meat. It was also more sour than spicy, so I got tired of it pretty quickly. For those four dishes, two bottles of beer and a glass of lemonade, our bill came up to $100.10, fairly expensive, but expected of the restaurants in that area.All in all, I think The Beast is an average place for food, but if drinks and socialising are more important to you, it's a nice place to hang out at.","106":"It's been five years since i had chicken and waffles, and this place hits the spot. The chicken was crispy deep fried and the waffles were super delicious, bu my favorite part is the bourbon maple syrup! Too good. Order thigh, not breast because mine came out dry.The 1 hour bottomless mimosa \/ DIY bloody mary was a nice touch too! You can mix as much hot sauce and garnishes as you want and they have so many different kinds.","107":"This place has recently launched some beastly brunches for the voracious appetites.It seems like a battle half-won for the Chicken & Waffles ($20), a monstrous hunk of deep-fried thigh on waffles. The chicken is excellently crunchy and tender, but the golden batter was too salty and thus one can't help but chomp it down with the partially deflated waffles for a balanced flavour. As a hard truth, the chicken tasted best when doused with the bourbon maple butter sauce. The Pulled Pork Hash $18 may very well typify the savage character of a beast. Imagine strands of meat ferociously teared apart and tossed with cubed potatoes, red peppers and BBQ sauce. But this Beast seems timid at heart for the taste was uninspiring and dry. A little more simmering of the pork with apple cider vinegar and chilli pepper may awake the soul of the Beast. Like most authentic Southern sweets , the desserts here do not go easy on sugar. I appreciate the thick Oreo crust of the Mississippi Mudpie ($14) but this strength also became its weakest link when the pie layer is as stubborn as a rock.The Bacon Waffle Sundae ($12) could be misleading for it is NOT a SUNDAE. But this can be forgiven because it delivered more than just a usual ice cream-waffle dessert. Accompanied by gooey butterscotch sauce, crunchy pecan brittles and a monstrous ball of Honey & Fig Ice Cream, the waffle itself has already surpassed the pallid version we've had earlier due to its sturdier structure and a distinct buttery notes. The crispy candied bacon was a bonus. \u00c2\u00a0But what I liked best was the bacon maple glazed donut ($5) which reminded me of a sticky sweet Bak Kwa bun that BreadTalk introduced years before or the \"Sweet Mother of Bacon\" from Artichoke. And it's actually a SIDE, not a DESSERT. Yes, petite in size but it may just be the wildest creature at the Beast.","108":"this place is hard for me to judge since there is such a contrast between upstairs and the ground floor. \u00c2\u00a0I like the ground floor much more due to the vide. \u00c2\u00a0the whiskey is pretty good if you like some of the American classics, but you will not find too many of the limited edition stuff... no Papi... but they have a selection that you wont be disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0they also have some good imported craft brews from Desuctes and even Magic Hat.now the on to the food. \u00c2\u00a0since it was only 2 of us we didn't go get the beast but we will next trip! \u00c2\u00a0the mac and cheese was ewey, gooey, greatness. \u00c2\u00a0the chicken wings could be some of the best i have found in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0the burger was pretty good but a slight hint of curry kinda threw me off. \u00c2\u00a0And for dessert chicken and waffles... yes please! \u00c2\u00a0they were excellent, with great crisp on the chicken (you can even get just the breast!!!) and the syrup was awesome.this place is cool if you can get over the load music and the service is 50\/50... but the food and drink selection is pretty great","109":"I hereby pass the crown of best sandwich in Singapore to The Beast's 3P sandwich. So much porkness hits you from all sides, it's simply delicious. Pulled pork + pork belly + bacon + apple slaw = heaven. It's a big sando, but even though I was double stuffed, I still found my way to get porked a bit further and finish it off.","110":"I had been meaning to try The Beast for some time after seeing that they served chicken and waffles and since my favorite place on Earth is Roscoe's in LA. While it's not quite up to the gold standard of Roscoe's, I thought The Beast was excellent. We all ordered the chicken and waffles and added a side of Mac and cheese with bacon and some fries. The chicken was moist and the buttermilk batter quite tasty. The waffles were very good and the bourbon maple syrup was excellent. All in all, a pretty darn good taste of home. The only downside was the service was only so-so. We sat outside and they seemed to be more focussed on the guests inside and a party upstairs - we waited over 20 minutes for an ice tea refill (which never came and we eventually cancelled). \u00c2\u00a0It took them almost 15 minutes to run my card after the bill got there. We weren't Ina rush so it wasn't a giant pain but was was not top notch customer care.The place is also a bar so is not really family friendly. Despite the no smoking signs, the table next to us was filled with smokers and this staff didn't seem to care (it was outside though). Pretty noisy and rowdy even for an early week day dinner. With that said,no will be back - the food made the trip worth it and I am anxious to try and great selection of bourbons!","111":"Had the pork hash and big biscuit. Pork hash was flavorful and complements the home fries. Biscuit and fried chicken was hearty and the gravy was decent. Pretty close to what you would get in the states. Coffee was not good though the bottomless mimosa makes up for it :)","112":"Not a bad place, but just average or maybe a smidge above a average. Fried chicken was a good fry - crispy wonderful skin and moist on the inside. Flavour was not that special though and the weird watery gravy that came with was pointless. Mac and cheese had a nice bacon-y touch. Buffalo wings had insufficient sauce. Lots of craft beer! (But pricey and no happy hour for craft beer. Sad.)","113":"When I first moved here I thought all western food in Singapore had to include baked beans, spaghetti and chicken cutlet on the menu. \u00c2\u00a0Actually there's been some great places opening the past few years. \u00c2\u00a0Someone suggested checking out this \"American\" restaurant so obviously it captured my interest (being American and all). \u00c2\u00a0When I say awesome I mean it in every sense of the word. \u00c2\u00a0To start its located a little off the beaten path. \u00c2\u00a0Its down from Arab St. \u00c2\u00a0Its a small little place with mainly outdoor seating and a few tables inside. Its cozy though and had a guy from Michigan singing cover songs. \u00c2\u00a0They have a nice menu of basically southern food and large selection of bourbon and whiskey. \u00c2\u00a0Its a nice spot to grab a drink or chill for dinner. Its not fancy or pretentious.So the food. \u00c2\u00a0The menu items are good. Its not a large menu but has a nice selection of plates to share and they were all pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0The buffalo wings were spicy which I love, the soft shelled crab sliders were good but not my favorite, pulled pork sliders were great, fried mozzarella sticks were good but basically mozzarella sticks so not super exciting and the bacon mac and cheese was super creamy and delicious. \u00c2\u00a0They have a number of mains which all looked good but there is one that catches your eye. \u00c2\u00a0THE BEAST!! I've never seen a burger THIS big. I dont even know how to classify it because it defies all logic...1.6 lbs beef patty, 1 lbs of pulled pork, 1 lbs of southern fried chicken, cole slaw, lettuce, tomatoes and probably a goat somewhere in there. \u00c2\u00a0Its all piled on top of \u00c2\u00a0a 9 inch bun (everything is in inches and pounds-truly American). \u00c2\u00a0The label states \"adequately feeds 2 stoners or 4 regular adults\". We shared it among 6 people with the appetizers. \u00c2\u00a0It was more than enough. Apparently if one person finishes it in an hour you get it for free which is kind of like saying if you jump off a building you don't have to pay for the ride down. \u00c2\u00a0 Attempt at you're own risk.","114":"I've been dying to find a Southern meal in Singapore e.g. Chicken &amp; waffles or biscuits &amp; gravy for breakfast but nothing seemed to have met my expectations. Well, i finally checked out the new Sunday Brunch at The Beast. Southern comfort food say what! It's time to get started thinking about bacon maple glazed doughnuts and lotsa bourbon. For starters, make sure you order yourself some Cornbread ($6). I love this one! It's way better than Kenny Rogers corn muffin which sometimes has these really strange chewy corn kernels. Expect a nice brown crust with a fragrant corn perfume. Make sure you dip into the maple syrup. Chicken and Waffles ($20) cannot be missed as well. Ok mainly the Southern fried chicken cannot be missed. The waffles are an afterthought (it was bland and thin) but that massive juicy chicken steak was flavorful and addictive. I still can't get over how much fried chicken i ate. The bourbon maple butter sauce added that little alcoholic bitterness and light sweetness to the overall flavor.The Pulled Pork Hash ($18) features a 10 hour pulled pork with bbq sauce that wasn't too overpowering. BBQ sauce has got to be my least favorite sauce of all time but this was quite enjoyable. The poached egg gave the dish a nice yolky moisture which made it even tastier. I could imagine this dish being made into a sandwich a la momofuku style.Biscuits are a huge part of Soul food and so we had to have the Sausage Biscuit ($18). It came with buttermilk biscuit, sausage patty, truffled mushrooms, swiss cheese and a sunny side up. The sausage gravy was sinfully flavorful (you really don't wanna know how gravy is made), but the biscuit and sausage were on the bland side. On the whole, it was sufficiently tasty. Bacon Maple Glazed doughnut ($5) was of a lovely density and had a nice crispy shell. It may be a little oily, and it also had that hint of oily taste but it's such comfort food! I couldn't help taking a few more bites.Our other dessert was the Mississippi Mudpie ($14). Well it's just boring ice cream really. It's not that it isn't tasty, but we were too stuffed to tackle my preferred Bourbon Pecan Pie with fig and honey ice cream ($12).We had an awesome time at The Beast. Food is really the highlight here. But be warned, make sure you keep the entire day free because you wouldn't be able to get out of that food induced coma after the meal. The good news is that you only need one meal for the day. Heh.The booze that we had were less than adequate however. Skip the sangria for it was way too diluted for me. The Mimosa was ok but it was more OJ than white sparkling wine. But I guess it works out ok if you do the 1h free flow version.","115":"Food could definitely use improvement and place is uncomfortable!We were seated inside, around a barrel - which looks cool, but perched on a bar stool next to a barrel isn't most conducive to enjoying a burger!We were here with friends, and ordered some cocktails - all of which were tiny for the price!My husband and I ordered the BEAST burger to share, because why not?The chicken was inedible - all gristle and fat!The burger meat was dry and a bit bland, and the pulled pork was the only thing that was tasty and good.I think this place is far from a 'cool southern diner' which is what they market themselves to be - save your money and go to MeatSmith!","116":"The bourbon selection is outstanding, Kentucky would be proud! For sure not the best southern food I have had, enough to to make my southern momma sad. No fried pickles or okra, One of my favorite dishes, fried chicken and waffles, was pretty bland and very greasy. Although the country boy burger had pimento cheese on it.. It tasted like it was cooked on a stove top. The music was great but the service was slow and apateticI'll comeback for the bourbon flights and will still be dreaming of Waffle House and Zaxbys.","117":"This was one of my favorite finds in Singapore! When we visited over the Singapore Day holiday weekend, the vibe felt relaxed and chill. The service was very attentive and we enjoyed an evening of great food and drink. Their chili crab dip waffle fries were amazing and I loved their cocktail with the lemongrass-infused vodka. Definitely recommend and hope to return next time I'm in town.","118":"Love this hidden gem in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0Though it's not on top of a 50 floor skyscraper (it's on the 3rd floor of an office building), Loof is unpretentious, has great eats and drinks, and has a great outdoor patio vibe.Some coworkers took us here for happy hour after one one day. \u00c2\u00a0Drinks and appies were on special ('cheap' by Singapore standards). \u00c2\u00a0Boozy bubble tea? I'm sold! \u00c2\u00a0They even serve it in a bubble tea plastic cup and straw. \u00c2\u00a0The appies were good but the BEST were the chili crab waffle fries. TBH, it's actually chili crab DIP but it was DA BOMB! \u00c2\u00a0Next time I am back i Singapore, I will definitely make a return visit up on the Loof!","119":"Nice, casual rooftop (3rd floor, no views) bar - it comes up in lists of best rooftop bars in Singapore, but I would not expect much. Crowd here is young, maybe they're coming for the happy hour specials. I took advantage of the Prosecco HH price of $11 a glass as opposed to the regular $18 a glass. Food options are limited but do the job, we got the chicken satay and shiitake mushrooms.","120":"3.5 starsWhereas a lot of rooftop bars are snobby affairs, Loof is everything except snobby. This bar has a fun and relaxed vibe. Additionally, the happy hour is one of the better deals you can find in Singapore: glasses of house pours, wine and pints of Asahi for $5++, hard to find a better deal!But unfortunately this bar has also some minor downsides:- the red wine comes chilled (WHY?)- the food menu looks inventive and attractive but has never managed to fully convince. The Ramly burger is probably my fave, but as far as the other dishes I feel like the food is: \"nice try but try again...\"But overall this is one of my goto rooftop bar's and I have been back several times so when in doubt between 3 and 4 stars, I decided to give them 4 stars cause I think the concept is great, it is decently priced and just because I like it there! Also, when I think about this bar, I cannot help it but \u00c2\u00a0sing in my head: \"the loof, the loof, the loof is on fire!!\"","121":"Awesome, hip spot right across from the Raffles hotel. Beautiful rooftop bar and wonderful happy hour spot. Their happy hour goes by the hour, so $5 SGD from 5-5:59, $6 SGD from 6-6:59, $7 SGD from 7-7:59, etc for well drinks. Pint-sized draft beers (Asahi black on draft, what!) are $10 in happy hour. THE DRINKSThe cocktails were the star of the show. Each was named after another famous Asian city or locaiton. My favorite was the Ginger Java - served with a grapefruit slice inside the middle. The Ho Chi Minh had wonderful mint and cucumber tastes, with gin. Lovely. THE FOODWe came here to try to infamous (even Ho Ching recommends them) Chili crab cheese fries. This is an interesting fusion idea, as is most of the food. I liked it, but I think I prefer traditional Chili cheese fries or Chili crab. The crab and Asian chili made it a little too sweet for my taste, but it was interesting. We also tried the roast duck and plum eggrolls, which were a bit overdone but not bad. Finally, we had the very nice happy hour sesame chicken wings. They were well fried and the glaze had a good flavor. THE SERVICE AND SETTINGAs mentioned, this is the perfect get together spot. Tables inside and out, with beautiful and lush greenery all over. The decor is modern and hip, and very inviting for you to linger and enjoy a Singaporean evening. The service is great and the waiters are friendly, helpful, and eager to serve. Would happily come back for any reason - happy hour, girls night out, date night, or a birthday party.","122":"Came here with work crew for happy hour; it was a great location with an amenable atmosphere the staff were pleasant but not overly friendly which is odd for a bar.We came to happy hour but were surprised that beer was not really included in the cheap drinks, only basic spirits and house wines; and even with the spirits they seemed unwilling to offer shots and it took an amount of negotiation to get this.We tried a lot of the food, from platters, snacks, finger foods and everything was well made and had a good amount of spice if the dish warranted it.The place was really happening by around 10pm; and it's great that they take bookings so if you wanted to head out at that time you can.","123":"This is a hidden gem in Singapore.. Roof top bar that caters for every different occasion. That is one that has drinks involved.For this occasion it was for birthday drinks, and it caters well for this. The staff were great, paid attention to the need for drinks and food.For the beer lovers, you can buy jugs to share, and the wine and cocktail list are more than adequate.Food was awesome, sharing plates, the hot chips with Chilli Crab.. Amazing... Spicy edemame and other great dishes.. Including 'hot as shit' chicks wings..For entertainment they have a 'beer pong' table, and that's where the real fun begins...","124":"Need a great happy hour spot or after dinner drinks? Loof is a good call. I was drinking their non-alcoholic Spa Splash with cucumber, mint and apple juice. Light, refreshing and not straight sugar. I was a happy girl. Not on the happy hour menu, though. The food menu consisted of some creative bar food. Chicken lettuce pockets were great, as were the chicken wings. The French fries came in a huge portion. The salad with calamari was awesome and probably the healthiest thing we ordered. Trying to follow paleo diet? This place isn't for you!The atmosphere was hopping with music cranked and patrons enjoying what appeared to be a game of beer pong. It was fun, but a bit tough to hear our company. Single lady? This place seems to be swimming with guys in their 20s and 30s. Just saying. You're welcome!","125":"Drinks were rather expensive. For a rooftop bar, it also doesn't have much of a view, since it's dwarfed by every other building surrounding it. Happy hour is ok though.Come with your expectations lowered, and you'll be fine - think of it not as a rooftop bar, but as an upscale dive bar that happens to be on a low rooftop","126":"We chance upon this place while researching for a decent restaurant to celebrate the birthday for a friend of mine. The setting of the bar looks really decent and heard some good reviews hence decided to visit this establishment. We spend a good 10mins trying to locate the place with the help of Google map. The signage to show the lift was not obvious and we had to circle the building just to find the sign. To ensure that I have a seat, I made a reservation via Chope (it is a pretty decent site), with an email reminder and a call from the bar, I felt that the before service was really well done. With high expectation, we were ushered to the long tables alongside of the bar-top and were given the menu. The menu was pretty detailed and with the help of online recommendation we order a couple of sides, mainly the Chili crab cheese fries, the happy hour chicken wings and a Kong ba bao (bun with pork). The food took some time to arrive and truth to be told, it was not really as fantastic as many mention. The fries were soggy, the wings were a tack too dry and salty, and the kong ba bao was not worth the money.However, my friends felt that the fries and wings were pretty decent thus the taste is up to your discretion. My friends order a couple of mixer to top it up since there is Happy Hour deals. But the drinks were quite disappointing and it tasted a little weird to us. At the very end, we did not finish the drinks. The service staff are friendly but the food took some time to arrive. The venue setting has really nice lighting and display however the music was just average. Hence if you are looking for a place to drink, I will not highly recommend this place. But it is still decent for the atmosphere with the open roof top concept.Improvement is needed on the speed of serving food and the quality of the drinks.","127":"Great location; outdoor watering hole. Review for the ambience and HH only. I like the chilled vibes and they have happy hour that goes by the hour e.g $5+ at 5pm; $6+ at 6pm etc. ends at 8pm. I missed out on HH this time because of a private event but will be back next time for HH and the food (interesting Asian fusion menu like chili crab cheese fries)!","128":"Loof is great for one reason and one reason only: Beirutin less classy circles, this would be referred to as Beer Pong, but all of us Ivy boys know what the true name is and will always be. Loof is one of the few places in Singapore where you can play this game. the tables are too short and too low, but they have cut outs for the cups which is pretty damn convenient.it's a little bit too hot for me, as it's outdoors on the roof, and me being an American i just can't handle singapore's heat. the drinks are nothing to write home about, as stated, Beirut is the only reason why Loof deserves a visit.","129":"I love Loof and it's time to tell people why. I'm gonna share it with everyone, cos I'm nice that way. HahahaAlright. So Loof has some really yummy dishes but my two faves are still their chicken wings (damn, super addictive!!!) and their chili crab fries (super Moreish!!!). These are just simply fantastic - like, mouthwateringly, finger-lickingly goooooood. Great wait staff. Service with a smile. My friend and I sat the bar, and suddenly the bartender sends us shooters he created. Just for fun. To let us try. For free. We compliment him on a refreshing shooter; he beams. And before we know it, he makes another round for us. On the house. Like, whaaaaaa?!?Ok. No no. All of that are great. But the reason why Loof deserves five stars is this -- their happy hour deals on house wines and house pours. 5-6pm = $56-7pm = $67-8pm = $7'nuff said. You're welcome.","130":"Cool bar on nice rooftop with a lounge vibe, and good happy hour discounts. The place gets pretty packed on Fridays with the after-work crowd. The waiters can't seem to keep track of payments and went around asking who was it that just gave them a credit card for payment in order to return the card.","131":"Great location, cold beer and wonderful bar foodThe chilli crab dip is the best I've had and the other food items were also pretty goodA novel approach to happy hour where the drinks go up $1 on the hour. Drink quickly!","132":"I was there for the Bobbi's Pole Studio Amateur night and honestly I was not very impress with this place because well, the service is just interesting. As the place was quite crowded I had no choice but to take a standing table... I informed the staff that my ankle was injured (due to a sprain) and I hope to have a chair for me.. and the staff had to ASK for permission before a chair was brought over to me. I was like really? Ask for permission to let an injured person sit down? If not, do I have to stand for the whole night? Really makes you wonder. Honestly, I found the place a \u00c2\u00a0bit too cramped for my liking and I was quite fascinated with how the waiting staff kept running about and not saying \"excuse me\" while nudging their way through the crowd.. I thought they will at least have basic courtesy to say \"excuse me.\" but i guess I was wrong. Drinks wise its ok and I can't say much about the view as its blocked by buildings higher than where the Loof was situated. So yeaps. I guess it's alright?","133":"Googled rooftop bars in Singapore. Loof was in the Top 10. Like most hangouts in the city, this may seem a bit pricey. Had some cocktails along with few appetizers. The chili crab cheese fries stood out. The chicken wings and chicken lettuce wraps were average.","134":"The newly renovated rooftop bar atop Odeon Towers has been hosting events since its inception, ranging from more high-profile ones such as the Giles Peterson events, and more recently, Tete-a-Tete which is an event where people get together and converse in foreign languages. The bosses of Loof were highly successful in marketing their concept, and have since opened The White Rabbit and Tanjong Beach Club. What sets Loof apart from your average bar is the choice of bar snacks. Tiger Toast ($9) with minced tiger prawns placed atop a lightly toasted piece of bread was very special. Their Loof Flies ($9), which essentially is French Fries with a variety of dips (wasabi, curry, chilli) was extremely addictive. It came in a bucket, and before the bucket was half full, we asked the waiter to get us another plate of sauces. Other interesting things on their menu are crayfish and babysquid, perhaps will try it another day.As for drinks, they have a standard range of wine and spirits. Try their Loof Life ($17), it is most refreshing with the zesty lime aftertaste. The Gummiberry ($17) is a drink I would recommend the girls, as the meringue (which the bartender slightly burns with his flame before serving) looks really pretty in pictures and tastes just as sweet as it looks too. Post-renovation, they updated their cocktail list to feature \"Asian Sensations\" - Ho Chi Mint, Penang Padi etc. Will definitely go back to try those ingeniously titled cocktails one day.","135":"One of the more touristy places\/bars. Drinks- Gummiberry (definitely a must try for ladies who love meringue). It's a fragrant concoction of forest berries, gin, Cointreau and French meringue. - The chocolate martini is an interesting concept but taste pretty average. - The other stuff is pretty standard. Food (typical bar finger food)- They use to have Monday Satays but now it's gone :( their satays were great! - Mini salmon pizza - pretty decent. Ambiance- It's a outdoor bar so it's pretty nice to when the weather isn't too hot or if it's not raining. Otherwise, probably should pass for the night. - The have limited number of indoor seats, comfy tanks with big fluffy pillows (as I recalled). \u00c2\u00a0If you can score one, it's probably a good place to catch up with friends. - Occasionally, they have a DJ too.","136":"Came here thought there is a happy hour on Saturday n told the waiter I want a happy hour red wine! He didn't say anything n ask my credit card to hold! That not a good service from the waiter from the loof!! Stay away loof on weekend as the drink cost SG$16 per glass as per weekday is max $8 during happy hour before 8 pm.. It is double the price!!","137":"Came to check out this place for lunch. I ordered Fresh Toast, which came with a canned drink for a total of S$10. Apparently they are having this lunch deal promo (Mon-Fri from 12-3 pm) for S$10, S$12, S$14 price - depending on what you order. Do take a look at one of the pictures I posted along with this review - to see a complete list.Going back to the French Toast I ordered, I really love it. The french toast is focaccia french toast - it came with slices of apples and peaches, and was drizzled with honey and rolled oats.The sweetness was just nice. The texture was great. The portion was quite big. If you plan to come here with one other person, it might be a great idea to order another dish - maybe the savory one. My friend ordered a burger that comes with curly fries. Man, I love the fries here. I think they put some herbs, which makes the fries smelled fragrant, and the crunchiness and thickness were just right. I think I might come again to this place just for the fries.They do have some interesting drinks, i.e. bandung latte and dirty bandung latte. Babycinno is basically just a cappuccino, but in a smaller serving.The reason of why I don't give 5 stars is because food may take quite sometime to be served. So it's a good idea to come here before you are really starving.I do recommend coming to this place for lunch. I love the vibrant atmosphere of the area, as well as for the lunch set deal itself. Definitely worth every penny =)","138":"Don't waste your money, it's all frozen food just deep fried. There is NO service, no once cares it's like as if you are doing them a favor by eating there. Wish I would have listened to all the other yelpers. Also do not go the toilet to was your hands, you have been warned. Top it off the prices are ridiculously high, do you self a favor and walk down the street to I Am Burgers similar pricing however the food is fresh and you get service from the staff whom appreciate you coming there. Now for the food :1. Over priced2. All frozen, Deep fried and oily3. Juices are NOT juices, they are sofa water with syrup which they do not even stir.There's 5 of us and we tried to order :Mushroom appetizer;we just ran outmushroom burger; we just ran outPizza; \u00c2\u00a0staff states I do not recommend ordering, why oh it will take too long 30-40 min, then why do you have on the menu.See pictures food is presentable but NOT worth the SG$140 we where charged for frozen food. PLEASE Note you have been warned , do not go here.","139":"\"Come here for free perfume - Eau de Deep Fryer\"Another Friday, another team lunch.So today, the team decided to check out Working Title - a caf\u00c3\u00a9 located at the tail end of Arab Street towards Beach Road in the Malay enclave of Kampung Glam. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 looks pretty neat and old school, with the use of floppy disk to tell you the wifi password (YES! Free wifi, such rarity in Singapore), used beer bottles as vase on each table and a very charming courtyard behind the main dining area. The courtyard looks like a nice meeting place for small groups but with the almost translucent roof, meaning a lot of natural light to the extent of almost too bright, the 5 of us decided to sit in the main dining area instead. Now the main problem at the dining area or should I say the setup of this caf\u00c3\u00a9 is the built in kitchen right in the main dining hall itself. If you want to have a open concept kitchen, you better make damn sure that the suction is working damn good and the ventilation is world class standard. But unfortunately for this caf\u00c3\u00a9, the suction they used is nothing but cheap ones and ventilation? If you call air-con blasting to ventilate the entire place together with the smell of oil all over, then yes, it's ventilation. \u00c2\u00a0But I don't think the right term for ventilation is what I just described.Food wise, it was alright. \u00c2\u00a0There are 3 versions of set lunch available with fancy names and price ranging from $9.90 to $14.90. You get a main and juice \/ iced tea. If you want to change to coffee, you will have to top up some amount of money. We ordered a couple of items from the menu - smoked salmon focaccia, beef burger and the big breakfast (not in set lunch) and we didn't enjoyed as much as we were rushing to quickly finish our food and get out from there. \u00c2\u00a0I will never ever come back to this place again for lunch unless they move the kitchen elsewhere. We're a bunch of office workers, dressed up in formal wear and imagine, all our hair and body smell like used oil from the deep fryer after lunch at this place. Tragic. P\/s: the staffs are clueless about the 10% yelp discount and was told you cant use that for set lunch which i thk it's rather stupid and irrelevent.","140":"My girlfriends decided to have our monthly Sunday brunch here after reading positive reviews about this place. But it turns out nothing as what we expected. Here goes. Unlike other brunch places on Sunday, this place is empty when we reach. Looks dingy. Ordering of food is self service. Same goes for water and condiments. They use Heinz packet chilli sauce. Very western-stall-in-local-coffeeshop feel.Starting off with satay sauce fries, served lukewarm, I would say it's just blah. You can even replicate it yourself. Just go McDonald's to get their fries then any satay stall for the peanut sauce and ta-dah, satay sauce fries. It is cheaper this way too.Don't know how long has passed, their Working Big Breakfast that I ordered came. The plate is pretty packed which is a sight I love. It has 3 slices of ham, a chicken sausage, salad, 2 slices of bread, a sunny side up and 2 pieces of turkey bacon etc. However, the only thing that is hot is my chicken sausage. The rest on the plate is at room temperature. Bread was untoasted. Dried mixed herb was sprinkled on the ham slices which puzzles me. It doesn't improve the presentation or even taste good. As for the salad, there is no dressing.My friend had their Gula Chicken Sausage. She was also disappointed with her food as the only hot food is the Gula Melaka caramelized onions which we find not bad. My another friend who is a vegetarian ordered the portobello egg and cheese. They have replaced the bacon for some tofu cubes. Not sure what to feel about this combination as it is pretty new to us too. Tl;dr: won't be coming back here again. Simple breakfast ingredients dumped on a plate. Tad overpriced imo.","141":"Extremely disappointed!!! How this place could have more than 2 stars. Had there a classic burger and could not imagine that a \"burger bar\" (it is how they call this place) could have that awful burgers !!!!I feel like they use a cat food meat in their burgers! To be short, I hope that the owner or manager would read my review and WILL fix a problem with a meat suppliers","142":"Cute little cafe on Arab street serving great breakfast, cakes, sandwiches and much more. The small courtyard at the back is ideal for relaxing with a good book or great friends. Love the interior and the service is also great. The cafe has an entrance to the hostel upstairs so you will find many travellers enjoying their time here.","143":"Menu mentioned truffle fries but was served normal curly fries in mine, asked them to change and truffle powder was sprinkled on it before returning.Doubtful service: when ordering the staff was not sure if the yelp's 10% discount is available, and they had to ask their boss (who's not around). End up, some of my friends have the discount and some don't, depending on who you were being served by. Apparently I heard that if the boss is around, standards will be very good. So we were unlucky...Maybe the coffee is better but we were there for lunch so didn't get coffee. The pizza was served over some baking paper like thingy. It stuck to the paper and my friends have to pry them out to eat. Can tell the pizza is not freshly made but was pre made and re-toasted in the oven, \u00c2\u00a0it stuck to the paper. And the toppings look pretty meager and sad...Overall I don't recommend this place and I will not come back again.","144":"I'm almost hesitant to write a review about this place because of how much I like it, for the fear of it being flooded by the fake hipsters from (the dangerously close) Haji Lane.My principle for patronising a cafe is very simple. I try not to go to ones that has appeared on a list of any sort, you know the ones I'm talking about- \"10 great cafes for coffee hopping\" on some random \"cool\" blog shared by 3482393 people on Facebook, chances are it's going to be overflowing with a crowd, the sort that takes 3482 top-down, generic-looking photos of their \"latte\" which they can't tell from their 3-in-1 instant coffee.Working Title on a weekday afternoon doesn't seem to suffer from these symptoms of cafe cancer that seems to be spreading to all establishments that appear on the likes of Timeout and 8 days.Prices were really moderate, a refreshing break from the other sorts whose goal is seemingly just to capitalise on the coffee\/cafe trend before it flops and dies like bubble tea. No GST or service either. Ammmazing.Combined with the 10% off upon first checkin on Yelp, it's a pretty good deal.$7 for a pretty decent slice of cake$6 for a rather huge pot of tea (interesting flavours brewed from real leaves)We didn't order much from the menu as we were just looking for a hopefully quiet location to sit down and spend the rest of the afternoon. Hopefully we'd be back for more in the future.Free, good, fast WiFi.Plenty of seats, a good outdoor area at the back which is enclosed with air-conditioning but with plenty of sunlight still. Suspicious noises came occasionally but nothing too disturbing to spoil the ambience entirely.There's music, not the loud top 40s shit that blares in your eardrums stopping you from having any kind of conversation.The decor is interesting. It is a haphazard combination of cheap swedish crap (read: IKEA) and other random odds and ends (wooden crates? Maybe stolen from The Bravery. At least here they put cushion on top!) but it works together very well. Doesn't come off as trying too hard.","145":"Cakes were nice... sandwiches were so-so... \u00c2\u00a0The tuna melt was tasty, but marred by having a very nasty cheese slice slapped on top rather than using fresh cheese.... \u00c2\u00a0The chairs, furniture etc. are a bit grubby...OK\/average, but nothing special.","146":"Work's been kinda crazy, so I've been on a Deliveroo binge. I'd heard a lot about the burgers from Working Title and decided to give the Baconator and the Honey Lemon Wings a try. The food arrived within half an hour. Despite being wrapped up in aluminium foil (not the best way to pack a delivery burger, IMHO), the burger was moist, still a little pink and pretty tasty. The patty was a little on the small side (which burger place in Sg isnt tho?) and because of the way it is shaped, hard to eat. Some bites were all bread, some were all meat. The turkey bacon and the caramelized onions were a nice touch, although I wish there was more mesclun and fries. Portions are small. If you're hungry, I'd recommend the Tower of Power (although two of those patties would be harder to eat!!) The wings were juicy but a tad on the sweet side (I'm more of a savoury person). Not bad considering it was delivered. Probably be much better eaten there","147":"Wondering down Arab St in Singapore started to have a very familiar feel to it. We suspected that we had stumbled across an indie (read: hipster) neighbourhood and decided to check out Working Title for some craft beer. Our suspicions were quickly confirmed when we spotted a table propped up by two old Mac computers, coasters made from floppy disks and a coffee blend \"feat. Kanye West\". We opted for a couple of pale ales in the courtyard and spent a relaxing hour or so reading the local street press and enjoying the sunshine. Great spot for a quiet beer and we even scored a discount for checking in on Yelp.","148":"Sitting there for almost the day. In fact, I have been hunting for cafe for the entire week to do my application. It's definitely an ideal place to relax. Nice atmosphere and vintage decoration. I order mint tea first and later, egg sandwich for lunch and then yogurt with corn flasks as dessert. A place that I will revisit for sure next time~!"},"stars":{"0":4,"1":4,"2":3,"3":3,"4":1,"5":4,"6":3,"7":3,"8":2,"9":3,"10":4,"11":4,"12":3,"13":5,"14":4,"15":4,"16":1,"17":4,"18":4,"19":5,"20":4,"21":5,"22":2,"23":5,"24":4,"25":4,"26":5,"27":2,"28":4,"29":4,"30":2,"31":3,"32":2,"33":3,"34":3,"35":5,"36":4,"37":4,"38":1,"39":1,"40":3,"41":4,"42":4,"43":4,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":3,"48":1,"49":2,"50":1,"51":4,"52":2,"53":4,"54":5,"55":1,"56":5,"57":4,"58":4,"59":3,"60":5,"61":4,"62":5,"63":3,"64":1,"65":4,"66":4,"67":4,"68":3,"69":4,"70":3,"71":1,"72":2,"73":3,"74":3,"75":2,"76":5,"77":4,"78":4,"79":4,"80":5,"81":3,"82":4,"83":4,"84":4,"85":3,"86":3,"87":4,"88":3,"89":3,"90":4,"91":3,"92":4,"93":3,"94":4,"95":3,"96":4,"97":4,"98":3,"99":4,"100":4,"101":4,"102":4,"103":1,"104":4,"105":3,"106":3,"107":3,"108":4,"109":4,"110":4,"111":4,"112":3,"113":4,"114":5,"115":2,"116":2,"117":5,"118":5,"119":3,"120":4,"121":4,"122":4,"123":4,"124":4,"125":2,"126":3,"127":4,"128":4,"129":5,"130":3,"131":5,"132":3,"133":3,"134":3,"135":3,"136":1,"137":4,"138":1,"139":1,"140":1,"141":1,"142":4,"143":2,"144":4,"145":2,"146":3,"147":4,"148":4},"date":{"0":"2015-10-30T00:00:00","1":"2019-04-02T00:00:00","2":"2016-10-07T00:00:00","3":"2015-11-01T00:00:00","4":"2018-11-06T00:00:00","5":"2017-09-22T00:00:00","6":"2015-11-05T00:00:00","7":"2016-06-20T00:00:00","8":"2017-05-19T00:00:00","9":"2015-12-01T00:00:00","10":"2015-11-28T00:00:00","11":"2016-10-15T00:00:00","12":"2016-05-22T00:00:00","13":"2016-09-25T00:00:00","14":"2016-01-11T00:00:00","15":"2016-08-20T00:00:00","16":"2015-11-11T00:00:00","17":"2019-10-23T00:00:00","18":"2019-07-05T00:00:00","19":"2019-04-08T00:00:00","20":"2017-11-19T00:00:00","21":"2019-09-19T00:00:00","22":"2017-05-02T00:00:00","23":"2015-12-07T00:00:00","24":"2017-08-31T00:00:00","25":"2017-09-20T00:00:00","26":"2016-09-29T00:00:00","27":"2018-04-18T00:00:00","28":"2015-08-31T00:00:00","29":"2018-08-14T00:00:00","30":"2016-01-13T00:00:00","31":"2016-10-02T00:00:00","32":"2017-07-24T00:00:00","33":"2011-06-24T00:00:00","34":"2013-02-17T00:00:00","35":"2014-10-09T00:00:00","36":"2016-10-11T00:00:00","37":"2019-08-15T00:00:00","38":"2020-01-28T00:00:00","39":"2020-01-30T00:00:00","40":"2020-02-03T00:00:00","41":"2020-02-05T00:00:00","42":"2019-08-11T00:00:00","43":"2019-07-24T00:00:00","44":"2018-08-01T00:00:00","45":"2018-09-28T00:00:00","46":"2019-06-12T00:00:00","47":"2019-06-13T00:00:00","48":"2019-03-11T00:00:00","49":"2019-03-12T00:00:00","50":"2019-07-25T00:00:00","51":"2019-07-26T00:00:00","52":"2019-08-02T00:00:00","53":"2019-11-22T00:00:00","54":"2019-11-23T00:00:00","55":"2019-09-24T00:00:00","56":"2019-09-25T00:00:00","57":"2016-08-01T00:00:00","58":"2015-01-20T00:00:00","59":"2016-05-22T00:00:00","60":"2015-06-09T00:00:00","61":"2015-04-11T00:00:00","62":"2015-04-12T00:00:00","63":"2014-06-08T00:00:00","64":"2017-06-11T00:00:00","65":"2016-02-19T00:00:00","66":"2013-03-25T00:00:00","67":"2013-02-23T00:00:00","68":"2015-08-08T00:00:00","69":"2014-12-06T00:00:00","70":"2015-03-30T00:00:00","71":"2015-05-02T00:00:00","72":"2016-09-03T00:00:00","73":"2013-06-14T00:00:00","74":"2012-12-06T00:00:00","75":"2016-04-11T00:00:00","76":"2012-11-19T00:00:00","77":"2016-10-11T00:00:00","78":"2017-12-26T00:00:00","79":"2018-07-27T00:00:00","80":"2018-06-19T00:00:00","81":"2016-02-23T00:00:00","82":"2017-06-14T00:00:00","83":"2015-11-27T00:00:00","84":"2015-10-03T00:00:00","85":"2016-01-14T00:00:00","86":"2016-11-17T00:00:00","87":"2016-05-28T00:00:00","88":"2013-03-12T00:00:00","89":"2013-05-07T00:00:00","90":"2014-07-28T00:00:00","91":"2014-10-21T00:00:00","92":"2014-01-02T00:00:00","93":"2014-12-03T00:00:00","94":"2013-11-24T00:00:00","95":"2015-09-07T00:00:00","96":"2013-03-16T00:00:00","97":"2017-06-01T00:00:00","98":"2019-08-16T00:00:00","99":"2015-06-04T00:00:00","100":"2017-09-11T00:00:00","101":"2015-08-02T00:00:00","102":"2016-05-31T00:00:00","103":"2015-02-08T00:00:00","104":"2014-08-02T00:00:00","105":"2015-05-27T00:00:00","106":"2014-11-23T00:00:00","107":"2014-09-25T00:00:00","108":"2014-08-23T00:00:00","109":"2017-07-01T00:00:00","110":"2015-08-01T00:00:00","111":"2015-04-26T00:00:00","112":"2015-06-10T00:00:00","113":"2014-07-31T00:00:00","114":"2014-10-11T00:00:00","115":"2016-01-18T00:00:00","116":"2014-08-08T00:00:00","117":"2019-10-12T00:00:00","118":"2018-10-09T00:00:00","119":"2018-02-05T00:00:00","120":"2016-10-05T00:00:00","121":"2015-12-02T00:00:00","122":"2016-07-17T00:00:00","123":"2014-12-13T00:00:00","124":"2016-04-06T00:00:00","125":"2017-04-29T00:00:00","126":"2016-09-08T00:00:00","127":"2015-11-03T00:00:00","128":"2014-01-03T00:00:00","129":"2016-01-22T00:00:00","130":"2015-03-29T00:00:00","131":"2015-06-07T00:00:00","132":"2016-03-24T00:00:00","133":"2012-08-29T00:00:00","134":"2016-07-13T00:00:00","135":"2012-08-09T00:00:00","136":"2013-01-08T00:00:00","137":"2015-06-16T00:00:00","138":"2017-07-03T00:00:00","139":"2015-01-15T00:00:00","140":"2016-10-10T00:00:00","141":"2016-11-26T00:00:00","142":"2015-03-29T00:00:0
