After a small wait, we got out bowl of delicious laksa.The soup in the dish was delicious and had a nice coconut flavor to it. The noodles were also smooth and the protein went well with dish.Overall it was a good bowl of laksa for the price you pay. Would eat here again if I'm in Singapore again.","2":"Laksa is a popular Southeast Asia spicy noodle soup with rice noodle in coconut milk curry soup. I'm not a big fan of curry but had to try it out. It was good and definitely worth a try if you can handle some heat. Even though I don't like curry, I still enjoyed it. Sungei road seems to be the best but we also tried the laksa in the Colony buffet (in Ritz Carlton) and thought the quality is pretty similar but this laksa is a fraction of the price. $3 for a small bowl.","3":"Laska is not my thing and after trying this still not my thing. I love noodles and soup, but I prefer simpler and clear broth. Although I'm not a fan of this soup, I can see why it's popular with the flavor profile of curry, coconut and chili. \u00c2\u00a0Bowls are small, but good size. If you're from the Americas think of it as a small chicken bowl size or a bowl of soboro don. Noodles are cut, only utensils available are spoons. Which fits perfectly for every bite and easily able to get a spoonful of noodle and fish balls and cakes. $3SGD. How can you go wrong with something flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0If it was my kind of food, I would eat this again and again just like the locals. Don't be alarmed at the long line. \u00c2\u00a0They serve it rather quickly. \u00c2\u00a0It ain't no howlin rays kind of wait, if you're from LA.","4":"Laksa here is so good! Tasty and rich in flavor. Line is always long, but goes by pretty fast. Bowl is a bit small, but its not pricy either. Love the combination of the fish cake, cockles, creamy coconut curry milk broth spices and noodles - everything blended so well just slurp up all the liquid yumminess! Delicious and worth a visit!","5":"Sungei Road Laksa was one of the more popular laksa-selling places I found online. When I arrived, there was already a sizable line that had formed. After I got in line, another large wave of people appeared out of nowhere and the line pretty much doubled in size (the amount of people waiting here speaks to its popularity).The laksa was super cheap and looked delicious; HOWEVER, the portion size was extremely small. They do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl, but I didn't find this to be a problem at all. The coconut flavor was pretty strong, but after I finished my bowl, I found that the overall flavor was not as strong as I was expecting. I liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy. I thought that I would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl, but I was surprisingly content. That being said, I easily could have had another bowl.For me, Sungei Road Laksa was a delicious introduction to laksa (first time trying it!). Although the line here may deter some visitors, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area.","6":"The bowls of laksa at Sungei Road Laksa, located in a small hawker center, are small but packed with flavor! You can tell this place is popular just from the lanes they've set up to organize guests waiting in line, and for a cheap, uniform price of $3, you get a flavor-packed bowl of rice noodles in coconut milk curry broth, topped with fish cake, cockles, herbs, and chili paste on the side! Interestingly, they also have a big sign on their stall that says \"no chopsticks,\" and you're only given a spoon to eat the dish, ensuring that you slurp up all the liquidy goodness!","7":"Best Laksa of life! Extremely affordable; $3 for a small bowl. Broth made traditionally with charcoal. Creamy coconut milk paired with spices, herbs and spicy sambal together create a sublime bowl of laksa. I love the hint of freshness from raw clams. Sungei Road Laksa do not give out chopsticks but rather, pre-cut noodles so you can inhale it with a spoon. The flavour profile really changes with every bite; sambal, clam, herbs, ouff tofu. One of the best thing I ate in Singapore! I licked the bowl when no one is looking! Definitely worth traveling for!","8":"A little shop amongst 15~20 other little stands serving amazing authentic food. No frills, they're not there to entertain you. Walk up, tell them how many bowls of the delicious yellow soup you'd like, pay and pick up your food. No chopsticks provided at this shop which is kind of funny because you're eating noodles. But the spoon will force you to slurp up all the soup along with the noodle. Not a bad idea actually.This bowl is TINY especially compared to American standards. I could probably eat 3 of these alone. Each bowl is only $3, so luckily I could comfortably afford all three bowls. BUT I didn't. I wanted to save my stomach for all the other goodies around here!Fyi this was a tiny bit spicy.. just the way I like it. And there are little clams in there (so yummy!!!!) --in case you're allergic. Highly recommend!!!","9":"As soon as we landed in Singapore, we were planning our food adventure. The first stop was Sungei Road Laksa, which was conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of our Airbnb.We shared a bowl of this delicious soup and were tempted to get more but knew that we had many other things to try. I loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick.","10":"Laksa so good. There won't be a line if you come early. At $3 SGD, this is a steal. The broth was so creamy and delicious - I wish I had doubled down on the order. Definitely worth the visit!","11":"The laksa here is so good. And at $3 it really is a steal. It's located at a hawker stall. After reading the reviews about it being small, my wife and i ordered 3 between us. Seemed to be a good amount for breakfast. As other reviews mentioned there's no chopsticks. But since the noodles were cut up I didn't find this to be a problem at all.","12":"Overall great Laksa- love the small bowl portion size. I didnt enjoy the clams in it however and i picked them all out. The food centre had large fans that def helped in cooling the place down to enjoy the food.","13":"$1.40 USD for a bowl of Singaporean laksa (the stuff most common in the States). \u00c2\u00a0Score!The real deal. \u00c2\u00a0Chili, turmeric, lemongrass, other fresh herbs and fermented shrimp all lovingly cooked off before adding shrimp stock, clam stock, and coconut milk, simmered over a charcoal fire.A handful of pre cooked noodles. \u00c2\u00a0Warm it by pouring the hot soup over it and dumping it out a few times. \u00c2\u00a0Add \u00c2\u00a0 cockles and home made fish cake steamed over an open fire. A little side of the chili base and that's it.No chopsticks. You eat this with a spoon. The noodles are very soft (overcooked by Western standards) but somehow it just works.The flavor, a punch to the palate, is unmatched in depth \u00c2\u00a0and complexity. \u00c2\u00a0Very strong seafood flavor, herbaceous notes, rich from coconut with a long fermented finish. It makes the laksa at the best place in my hometown taste like water in comparison.Washed down with a fresh squeezed calamansi juice to kill the spice. \u00c2\u00a0Satisfaction achieved.ps. Because of the wood fire, the flavor beats that of the more famous three number spot with Gordon Ramsay affiliation. \u00c2\u00a0Just saying.","14":"This is a simple bowl of laksa. No frills. I like the renovated stall. You only have one option now. Strictly $3 per bowl. No upsize. I saw people order two bowls for themselves after they requested for large and was told only one size. It is not a big bowl but it can be filling, especially when you also order a drink. It is without chopsticks (also stated clearly at the stall - I think they got tired of people asking) like the original katong laksa in katong. It comes with just bean sprouts, sliced fish cake slivers and cockles. None of those fancy prawns, taupok or even crayfish in other versions. Mix the chili into the gravy to get the red gravy we are used to seeing. It is not that spicy. Now that I like cockles, this is the place for my fix. It is chockfull of it. The first time I tried it was over 10 years ago before the renovation and I was not that into it. Maybe because it was hot and muggy, plus I did not care for such a small bowl with simple ingredients then.","15":"Worth the hype and the trek! This seemingly humble bowl of $3 SD laksa is packed with a heavenly blend of sweet, sour, spicy and lots of umami....after one spoonful I already wanted another bowl!I arrived around 11AM and waited only about 10-15 minutes, building up my appetite as my eyes feasted on watching the aunties stirring and ladling big spoonfuls of soup over a charcoal stove. The soup is fills you with umami and fresh cockles and packed with strong flavors of chili and curry, all balanced out by sweet coconut milk which lightens the broth to be perfect. A noodle soup is good when you drink it to the last drop and that's exactly what it did.","16":"Good place to get decent LaksaRecommended, but with caveats (read on...)We were out shopping and in the mood for Laksa, and this place was highly recommended.Food:We kept it simple and ordered only Laksa (and Kueh Pie Tee from next door). The Laksa was flavorful, even if the gravy was a bit thin. It was available with cockles, which was disappointing since some places will happily substitute prawns. And they sell only one size, which I would call small. The Kueh Pie Tee was tasty, but with ground peanuts is not traditional Nonya style.Cost:At $3 for a bowl, the Laksa is an excellent value.Service: Good, the queue was quite long, but went quickly. The uncles were quick to clear away the bowls after.Atmosphere:This is a coffee shop (no aircon). Overall:If you're in the area and craving Laksa, it's definitely worth stopping here.","17":"The laksa here is definitely tasty and rich. The laksa gravy is the main character of the dish. I would give the taste of this dish 5 stars.However, I believe the service can be better. When I came here during one of the Saturdays, the staff was able a bit rude and impatient to us. On normal days, they are fine. I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for tasty and delicious laksa.","18":"Sungei Road Laksa is frequently patronised by my family as the laksa gravy is milky, rich and mildly spicy. Note that they won't give you any chopsticks nor a fork as you will only eat with the given spoon! The noodles are all cut into shorter lengths so you will have a easier time consuming it this goodness!The price is relatively high for a EXTREMELY small bowl of laksa.($3) But who cares if it's delicious!","19":"$3 SGD for a delicious bowl of laksa served the traditional way with no chopsticks. I came here at 10:30 in the morning and there was already a line with 3 people in front of me. With only one item being served and only one size, ordering was a breeze. When it's your turn, just let them know how many bowls when you're standing in the queue. Watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times. The bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake, and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl. Taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa I've had before was by no means on par with Sungei Road. The soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste, the complex blends that builds the curry, and finally the spiciness from the chili paste.Eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long, don't wear a white shirt by the way! The bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards.","20":"These small bowls of intensity are elevated by a scoop - yes, a scoop - of cockles. I'd never seen anyone so cavalierly scoop spoonfuls of cockles out of a big bucket of cockles before. To me, cockles are things you laboriously pry open for minutes on end just for one sweet bite. Having 7 of them in one bowl was unimaginably decadent.Also, the broth: while it's coconutty, that's not the dominant taste. It's funky and green and very spicy if you choose to mix the whole dollop of chili in. They don't let you use chopsticks, which I don't understand, unless it's to recreate the frustration of trying to get cockles out of their shells; the noodles are too slippery and long to be held by the spoons and you end up slurping them right out of the bowl. Luckily, that's not considered rude in Asia.","21":"Came at 11:45am or so and there was a very minimal wait. About 3-4 people ahead of me. When I left around 12:05, there was a long queue of 15-20 people. With 3-4 people ahead of me, it took maybe 5-7 minutes to get through, so it definitely goes by pretty quickly. $3 SGD for this bowl of noodles. The soup was good, but not as rich as I expected for laksa. One bowl is probably not enough for a meal, but a great snack size. The noodles were quite soft, a bit too soft for my liking. Almost don't have to chew...Ordering system is a bit quirky. You tell them how many bowls you want, when there are still customers in front of you, so they can start preparing them. Its quite interesting to watch them work. It seems like they have the process down to a science. The number of scoops of soup in and out of bowls, etc. And they work with a charcoal stove. No chopsticks, only spoons, but they cut the noodles into spoon size portions for ultimate speedy consumption. I would recommend trying.","22":"Awesome place for laksa. \u00c2\u00a0They only give spoons, but luckily they cut the noodles so it wasn't too hard to eat. \u00c2\u00a0The flavors are spicy and savory, and they also had plenty of seafood pieces throughout the whole bowl!","23":"I never had laska in my life and was highly anticipating my visit to this shop. While there were a lot of flavors going on, I didn't enjoy the dish and couldn't finish it even though the portion was small. The seafood\/brininess was too overpowering for my liking. 3 stars for $3!","24":"Where to find a bowl of traditional and yummy Laksa in Singapore without burning a hole in your pocket? Well, its right here at Jalan Berseh in a humble corner of a coffeeshop. Considering bowls of laksa that we had eaten before, nowadays, how many of them still have the gravy cook over charcoal fire?There are a few stalls named Sungei Road Laksa, apparently they are not affiliated with this stall as they have openly declared on their signage that there are no other branches. Sungei Road Laksa is a family business and you can the family members each having their dedicated tasks. You can observed the flow of their ordering process while you are in the long snaky queue.What makes a perfect bowl of Laksa? I'm not a fan of Laksa with strong \"Lemak\" (Coconut Milk\" gravy and Sungei Road Laksa has a well balance of all flavours in a simple $3 portion bowl. Just like the traditional way of eating, there is no use of chopsticks for the noodles as the long noodles wereLaksa - $3Gravy is not spicy and that is one of the reasons why I started loving it when I was a kid. Ingredients are simple with cockles, slices of fishcakes, laksa leaves and chilli to add some spicy kick to the bowl.I wouldn't say no to this comfort bowl of childhood favourite. \u00c2\u00a0They are opened daily 9.30am to 5pm but closed on Wednesday. I bet you will feel the same that the queue is worth waiting for!","25":"3.5-4\/5I prefer Katong Laksa over this place, while they do seem to take the Laksa making art more seriously (at least by the expressions on their face), for me the one size only (small) and the lighter broth doesn't win me over easily.Expect a lineup if you go during lunch hour.Repeat: No","26":"On a Monday at 11:30am? No wait! The clams. So fresh, so clean clean. The fresh clams itself is worth $3. So I ordered two bowls. If you're used to the US equivalent of a small pho bowl, then you have to order two bowls.I'm sure there are better laksa places for the locals, but this will do the job if you're visiting and wanted to see what the hype is all about!","27":"Was looking forward to visiting this place when traveling in Singapore because of the great reviews. Unfortunately, Laksa did not taste good at all, couldn't finish it. They had No pictures sign! I found that a bit ridiculous..","28":"easily a five stars review!but i also procrastinate to write, easily.easy menu options, small bowl($3) or big bowl($4)?out of town visitors, from my motherland, in queue in front of me were debating what they should order?i had to step in and yelp!they then proceeded to show me photos of rojak?so i said only laksa here and no, it is not the katong kind!the sign above the stall clearly says sungei road laksa?!in any case, once it's your turn to order, just say big or small and perhaps how many, thanks.easy on the wallet and stomach, cheap and not too jelak(cloyingly rich)!yes, even the big bowl may not be enough for the ravenously hangry.but remember, everything in moderation and you might live to 100!so yes, the easiest part about coming here is finishing that small bowl.if you are not fuss about how cooked your cockles are, you can be done in 3 mins?if you prefer less bloodiness, submerge your cockles and leave to sit for a minute or two?still, you can easily up and go 5mins after receiving your bowl!that's where the easy parts end.folks, get the timing right.some have missed out because they keep coming on a wednesday when they are......CLOSED!also they are more a morning\/lunch business, so come early as they will close as and when they sell out.the queue can be long but it does move fast.however, you might still sweat a little as it is rather hot and stuffy in this coffeeshop.the essential use of charcoal fire ensures the right temperature and imparts a smokiness that cannot be replicated otherwise.so it is anything but easy to make that tiny bowl.just look at the prep that goes on behind the scene before each bowl can be slurped.finally, coming here is also not easy.not near mrt or bus station, walking is required unless you drive, uber, grab or cab here.nevertheless, i can easily predict that you will be back!","29":"Outstanding laksa in an informal setting. \u00c2\u00a0Long lines but worth the wait. \u00c2\u00a0Don't miss it if you want great laksa.","30":"Laksa is a must try dish while visiting Singapore, and Sungei Road Laksa is your MUST GO place to get laksa in Singapore. Yelpers gave another great suggestion and this place definitely did not disappoint. The place is located in a more residential part of town. I actually took a taxi here as it wasn't very close to any subways stations. But it was so worth it! Its one of 5 stalls in a smaller hawker center. So order your food, watch them cook it, and take your order to any open table. They only sell one item (not even drinks), but its so good! Their laksa broth is creamy and flavorful, yet still light. You get a choice of spicy or not spicy. The spicy comes with a spoonful of chili sauce. Get it spicy, as it provides a good kick without the burning sensation. I rarely ever finish the soup when I eat noodles as I always feel like restaurant soup noodles use a lot of msg or salt in their soup. However, this was one of those times where I drank all the soup, licked the bowl, and still wanted more! I love the cockles they have in the soup. It has that seafood freshness and sweet taste, which I've never had before. The bowl is really small, but is only $2 SGD. The taxi driver suggested I order 2 bowls since the bowls are small. He was right, and 2 bowls were just perfect! They don't sell drinks. Instead, you'll see a lady come by from another stall taking drink orders. I brought my own bottled water, so I declined. But the lady sells juices and beer. There's also another old lady that comes by to sell you tissue packets, just in case you weren't carrying any on you. (No napkins provided here either.)FYI, they don't give you chopsticks for these noodles, and you don't really need them. The spoon they provide is enough to finish all the noodles and soup!","31":"Truly this place deserves a \/5 rating.This place is small and lunch room style seating, but the food is so damn good. If you are in Singapore and want Laksa this is the place to be.Always a long line but worth the wait. Staff are friendly and you simply pay by the bowl no other options. Here it is only 3 SGD, so I feel that this is a great deal.","32":"$3 is very, very cheap, considering the price of Singapore food these days. The queue is massive however, and it makes me think twice whether or not the time spent was worth it.Ok, I've thought twice! It's totally worth it! I hadn't had such a satisfying 2 bowls of laksa meal for a long while.","33":"Caveat: I'm probably not qualified to write this review. I had only tried laksa a couple times before at sit down restaurants, which likely have a completely different approach to this dish. Anyway, being in Singapore, I knew I had to come and try an authentic bowl of laksa. After reading a few google hits on \"best laksa in singapore,\" I saw that this place consistently was mentioned and was closest to my hotel (my mom will walk nowhere in the heat). So we came here. It was located inside a pretty archetypal hawker market. not the cleaner style newer ones that are inside and air conditioned, but an open air alcove of food stalls with just a few ceiling fans to combat the heat. (Note, this place does have bathrooms that don't charge, which is a plus for a hawker market). Anyway, the sungie road laksa stall is located in one of the corners to the market. I'm pretty sure they only serve this one dish, so it's pretty efficient service. However, note that they do not provide chopsticks, which I found weird. Although the laksa noodles are cut short, they still don't fit that well onto the spoon and chopsticks would have been helpful. Moving on. I ordered a bowl for myself and a bowl for my dad. I guess the first thing I noticed was that this version didn't have prawns, which I thought was a sine qua non for laksa. It had only fish cakes and what I thought were clams but what my Singaporean mom said were cockles. So I guess they were cockles. It was not aesthetically pleasing like the laksa I had seen before. Also, while I used to love them, I'm not a huge fan of bivalves anymore because they kind of taste like sand and saltwater to me now. Also they look gross. But how did the whole thing taste? The broth was tasty, though it started getting very spicy toward the end because I mixed the entire dollop of chili paste into my broth. Definitely buy a chaser of water with this dish. The fish cakes had a very light flavor to them, however, the cockles tasted like the aforementioned saltwater and sand, which I didn't prefer, but ate anyway because I was starving. Overall, I guess I was just expecting more. More seafood, more flavor, more presentation. But, my Singaporean dad, who grew up eating laksa, said it was one of the best he had ever had, so I guess it's probably really good to people who know what they are talking about.","34":"This is really as good as it gets!The only thing that could beat the rating would be if this is in an air conditioned food court. The laksa gravy is not too thick and it brought out the goodness in the creamy not so spicy soup. Even though the bowl of laksa only costs $3, but I always take a cab to eat it since it is pretty far from my place. But as you know, it just means it is worth more than $3 since I am willing to cab over. ;)","35":"Came here because of the positive yelp reviews. A bowl is only $3. It's good if you like a creamy curry taste and don't mind the hunks of fish that taste really fishy. The noodles are really good.","36":"I ate the best bowl of Laksa at Sungei Road Laksa and I think now there is no turning back!My sister was complaining when I made her follow me and took the trek to have mid morning snack. Maybe I should took a taxi but my google map app told me that it was like 15 minute walk from my hotel.But it was all worth it when she ate that whole bowl all by herself! It was empty and she even drank all the soup when I went and get us a barley drink!I ended up getting one for myself! It only cost $2! The soup base has so much depth: spicy, sweet, salty and creamy! I love the cockies! I love the noodle! I love how I can eat the whole thing with a spoon.Worth getting there early to beat the rush as it was not busy at all when I was there. I can have a few more rounds if I wanted!Maybe I should have a few more bowls! Extra Spicy please!","37":"Absolutely delicious. Straightforward bowl of laksa for a good value. I really enjoyed the cockles and how the flavors were a great blend. I just wish they had larger sized portions but with only $3 SD a bowl, getting multiples is an easy solution!","38":"Best Laksa packed with huge favors. I ordered 3 bowls for lunch. I came back the next day for another 3 bowls before leaving Singapore. Worth it!","39":"Normally the queue is huge but today there was none so quickly took the opportunity to try this place. The broth is tasty and better than most Singaporean laksa places, but lacked the \"oomph\" I'm used to from Malaysian varieties. A good (massive) dose of sambal would help. Otherwise for $3 a bowl, it's a pretty good deal.","40":"First off ordering was confusing. Once you get close to the front of the line, they call you to order your dishes on the right side of the stall. You got to pick your dish and what size you want. Now a SGD8 meal is regular size. After you order the dish, you get back in line! I went to the back! But the guy waved me over to get back in my original spot. This was confusing and new people like me will be like WTF. I might have done it wrong too.The line wasn't too long when we arrived at 11am on a weekday. You get the benefit of the drink stall next door to order drinks. It is fun watching the chef create the dish at the front of the line.I got the dry and soup noodles. As for the soup noodles, I did not get much flavor in the noodles. I was questioning what was the hype. But then after trying the broth, I knew that was the key. Very flavorful and very thoughtful how they created this dish. The dry noodle dish is good as well. It has strong vinegar taste to it. Also the soup provided is on the sour side. All very good.I can see it getting hot eating here. You are eating hot food after all. Prepare yourself with fans, and cold drinks.","41":"Simple, delicious, made with heart. Have you ever eaten at a Michelin-starred spot for $6?Not only is Singapore a dope vacation destination, but it has cheap, delicious food. I do not read Chinese and didn't quite know if the menu was going to have any English so I chose what I wanted ahead of time. Bak chor mee with dry noodles. OMG this noodle dish is gooooood. Must be the black vinegar that makes it . There are so many different flavors that go into this one dish. It manages to incorporate all of the five basic tastes as well as other textures.Downside: 1. Long queue to order. 2. Im told the price went up with popularity. Upside: 1. Deliciousness. 2. Only takes only a few minutes to prepare. Is it worth it? I think so. Recommend double the noodles and add the soup.","42":"They have a few outlets and we went to the one in Upper Cross Street (inside Hong Lim Food Center).This is a well known establishment whereby the founders started the first stall in 1939. Their pork dumplings are simply delicious and my family always makes it a point to order an extra bowl to share, on top of our S$5 bowl of minced pork noodle.We have tried many stalls of such noodles and I dare say that Tai Hwa rates as one of the best. In fact, the original stall in Hill Street made it into the Michelin 2019 guide for Singapore.","43":"Hawker center food is on everyone's list when they go to Singapore, and we started our experience at Tai Hwa for lunch. After waiting in the queue for almost an hour, getting berated by the other stall owners for taking over what used to be a local establishment, and feeling rather mediocre on the food from Tai Hwa, I'm not sure this is worth going out of your way for. Do I think it's a great value for the price paid? Yes absolutely. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not. Singapore has many fantastic places that allow you to stretch your dollars as far as you can...but unless you're nearby to Tai Hwa, I'd opt for another place.","44":"We showed up on a Monday and saw literally no one in line, cause they were closed. So we tried again the next day right at 9am, before our flight out at noon, thinking that we had plenty of time in between. Man, we were wrong. First off, we didn't know that we should have got there even earlier to claim one of the 25 tokens that will keep your first 25 spots before the line even started to form. So although there were only about 8 people in front of us when we got in line, it took them 1.5 hour total to go through those 25 tokens and the people in front of the line AND AT LEAST 10 OTHER to-go orders (which, I think, should have been taken care of ONLY AFTER those people who are actually waiting in person). Food: we ordered 2 Bak Chor Mee and they were tasty. It's a shame that we had to inhale our food right away to leave for the airport; and not so much enjoying it after the long wait. Overall, I think I can go somewhere else for similar noodles without the wait and cheaper price tag (not that $8 was expensive but Singapore just offers so many options for cheap eat). The verdict: I'm glad that I tried their noodles and it was honestly really good. I can see why they got the Michelin Star. However, I would only go back if the wait is a lot shorter and definitely not before catching a flight in less than 3 hours.","45":"It's a great spot in singapore but i feel like it's jumped the shark a bit. You'll find the long lines but not of locals but of tourists. I've had better Pork noodles in singapore at a cheaper price and shorter wait. Yes the noodles stand out but i feel like the soup and ingredients were standard. The fish cracklins were great though. Crunchy and flavorful. It's a try if in the area but i wouldn't go out of ones way to get a bowl.","46":"Long lines for this place! \u00c2\u00a0I was here mid day and there was still a steady lineup of 10 people or so people. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the bak chor mee after about 30 minutes standing in line. \u00c2\u00a0They make 1 bowl at a time and some guy ordered 10!The noodles are tossed in a vinegar, chilli oil and soy sauce mix which is then topped with what tasted like pork liver, minced pork, a couple of wontons, a couple of meatballs and some additional meat slices. \u00c2\u00a0There was also a dehydrated\/fried fish slice on top. \u00c2\u00a0 They tasted very different from noodles I've had in the past but definitely enjoyed it. \u00c2\u00a0Take some additional chilis to add to your bowl!","47":"Since this was listed on the Michellin Guide, I have to give it a try. I planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported. Arrived at 5pm and there was a queue but tolerable. Waited 30 minutes for my food. A good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you. Multiply by 2 as each is likely ordering for 2 people. Then multiply by 2 again as it takes 2 mins to prepare a bowl of noodles. So # of people in front of you * 4 = average wait time. Is it worth waiting more than 30 mins? I don't think so. The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good. There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything. A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom. Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs. My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time.","48":"One of the cheapest Michelin Star food you can get. The meat balls are super delicious! Some times you'll have to Q for an hour to order","49":"Noodle in general is good. Abit salty for me, but still ok lar... however, queues up for 1.5+ for a bowl of pork noodle, maybe not as worth though. U decide...","50":"Famous Michelin-star bak chor mee stall in SG. The noodle here is very flavorful - strong flavors across sweet\/salty\/sour\/spicy which makes the bak chor mee standout. They also give you a lot of sides to accompany the noodle - sliced pork, minced pork, wonton, meatballs, liver, noodle crisps - everything taste excellent and a good balance to the noodle. Portion is big which probably explains the above average price. Would go back again if in the area. However, while this is a very good bak chor mee, it's probably not good enough to warrant 1 hour+ wait during peak hours","51":"This place gets 4 stars for the 2 hour wait... \u00c2\u00a0It just might not be worth it. \u00c2\u00a0I know I wouldn't line up again. The only incredible part of this is how slow the line moves. \u00c2\u00a0The food is pretty good, and would be on my 5 star list (also has a michelin star) if there wasn't a line. \u00c2\u00a0The liver is extremely well done, and tender. \u00c2\u00a0The noodles are pretty good, but does this make it significantly better than other bak chor mee places? Nah. It's the best you'll get but not worth the wait if you can go elsewhere. \u00c2\u00a0I'd try it once, if there's almost no line, and that's it. People line up before they open so maybe consider getting there very early?","52":"You can write 10-15 Yelp reviews while on queue!I personally didn't mind the wait and thoroughly enjoyed the noodles after ~1.5hr of waiting. Maybe I was just hungry? I wish I had ordered a larger bowl after waiting for that long.I'm not sure if I'd be back but it's definitely a place to try out at least once because if its Michelin status.","53":"Pretty solid place with some awesome flavours. I had the dry noodles and it was really awesome to get so many different pork meat varities in different forms. The sauce is a bit spicy and the soup delicious. Not something I would wait for but worth a one time visit.","54":"Line may seem long but only because the chef takes so long to make each bowl. I personally waited almost two hours and the dish wasn't exceptional or anything I hadn't tasted before. Many other better options nearby but significantly less wait!","55":"Now that it has received a Michelin star, there are more tourists joining the queue for some bak chor mee. We went at 5pm on a Friday and it still took about 45 minutes to wait in line for the food. There were about 14 people ahead of me. But we saw there were only 2 people in line at 6pm. Hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest. The queue system is neater now. Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait. The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6. It was soft but a bit on the salty side. I still gave it a 3 stars because of the queue system. Not everyone can stand for that long. I rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait.","56":"I waited for about 40 minutes in a queue of maybe 10-12 persons before me at 11+am. I seriously do not think a bowl of noodles is worth this long a wait. The noodle was good and flavorful (lots of vinegar), with nicely cooked meat (not too tough). The dumpling was a bit too big and chewy. The thing I liked most was the fried sole fish (ti poh) which gave a bit of ommph to the noodle. But to wait for 40 minutes or more? I don't think so. The most I will queue for this will be 20 minutes. For a stall with 4 people working in the kitchen and another taking the order (4-5 people before your turn), the turnover is too slow. And we are not talking about every customer ordering 5-10 bowls of noodles.","57":"2017 Michelin stars: 1The dish is delicious. Let's get that right out of the way. So much so, that I've spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. Obviously my homemade version isn't as good, but with some tweaks I think it could be a passable substitute. Here is where the wheels fall off the wagon. It's cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it's received. On our first attempt, we waited for about 1.25 hours and only moved 4 tiles (we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go) which was not much. We gave up.We returned the next morning 30 minutes before opening and received number `11`. If you guys are missing a number `11`, I might know why. It was another hour wait before we got our food -- this time we were determined; which was delicious as I've mentioned. The whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of Singaporean weather was just lost on me. Yes the food was delicious. Yes it was cheap. But for a Michelin star you have to do something above and beyond. I feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over Singapore, you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha.. It's the challenge that Yelp and Michelin diners face -- seek these places out! Find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent. Blaze the trail for others to follow. Don't just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective. You might find something you really like... A diamond in the rough.","58":"As I was on a Michelin food hunt that day, after eating the soy sauce chicken in Chinatown, I immediately headed over to this noodle place for lunch. Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special. If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass.","59":"One word. AMAZING. We went on a Tuesday morning, thinking it wouldn't be packed. But when we got to the store at around 10:30, there was already roughly 20 people in line. After roughly 2 hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles, we finally got our orders in.And let me say this. The wait was totally worth it. The noodles were hand pulled, very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base. There was a wide selection of minced pork, liver, sliced pork, wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl. Plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours. The combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite. Crunchy, savoury, sour and spicy. Definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good, especially with the pricing being $8 for medium.","60":"I got to Tai Hwa 30 minutes after opening and waited in line 1 hour 15 minutes. I appreciated that each batch of meat was cooked to order for just the right amount of time, ensuring tender pork and liver. The noodles were springy and the sauce punchy and well balanced. While I definitely enjoyed my noodles, it was not amongst my favorites in Singapore. If I lived in the neighborhood I would visit again. Otherwise I am sure places with equally delicious noodles and a shorter wait exist. Just have to be in the know I guess!","61":"Michelin 1-Star (2016) coffee shop stall with 1-2 hr long queue. Arrived 11.20am, with over 1 hr wait in line, in hot humidity. Each bowl is freshly individually prepared, average 2-5 min per customer depending on # bowls order at $6, $8, $10. Recommend $6 bowl, better value. Tasty noodles in chili and vinegar sauce, with pork balls, mince pork, liver, wanton. Good noodles, but not worth 1 hr wait and price. Of Michelin cuisines tasted in France, Germany, Italy, USA, am not sure how this one-star was awarded. At best, only bib gourmand, in my view. Not worth long wait, come off peak hours if curious to try. Many other good bak chor noodles elsewhere with better queues and price.","62":"One of the two hawker food stalls awarded a Michelin star! The line can be long, and it does take a while to get your food. But just know that it's because it's a popular spot. Also, they make the noodles one bowl at a time.Two noodles options: with soup or dry. Both noodles have a mix of pork meat and organs and wontons. We got one of each, and I would say the dry one, bak chor mee, is the more flavorful one. A mix of chili, soy sauce, vinegar on the bottom; freshly cooked noodles on top; then the meats and wontons.Four sizes available. $5, $6 (regular), $8, $10.","63":"So. good. period. I've never had this type of pork noodles before and I'm glad I got to try it! We got there around 1245 on Saturday and there were about 30 people ahead of us. We ended up ordering 1.5 hours later. Everyone says to order bak chor mee but it doesn't say it anywhere on the menu. I'm assuming it is number 3 gan mian and they say \"mee pok\" id also the same thing. I ordered bak chor mee, regular size, dry, with chili. You can watch the crew make your food right in front of you like a fine oiled machine. I'll go home thinking about this bowl of noodles! The salty, sweet, sour flavors of the noodles are perfectly balanced. It comes with a small bowl of seaweed soup. Others ordered some kind of meatball soup to go with the noodles. I don't think I would wait 1.5 hours again for this 1 michelin start rated food, but the next 20 times I go, I would plan to go when it's not as busy.","64":"Chef is like a mad scientist. \u00c2\u00a0Best noodle dish I've ever had and worth the 45 min wait. \u00c2\u00a0I want to go back to Singapore just to eat there.","65":"First saw pics of the noodles from Tai Hwa on Instagram and knew this would be one of my first stops during our Singapore trip. \u00c2\u00a0After reading a few reviews, I knew to avoid this place during peak times so we ended up coming for a late lunch on a Monday. \u00c2\u00a0For some reason the taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong location (not far but ended up walking a few blocks). \u00c2\u00a0I was glad to have google maps open so that we could find this place. \u00c2\u00a0We arrived to find a short line and waited about 5 mins before placing our order. \u00c2\u00a0For those that don't speak Mandarin, I'm not sure how successful you'll be ordering food here as the guy who took our order did not speak Cantonese and spoke very very little English. \u00c2\u00a0It took a total of 15 minutes before we sat down to eat. \u00c2\u00a0I ended up with a $5 bak chor mee bowl of noodles and it definitely lived up to the hype! \u00c2\u00a0I would definitely wait an hour for a bowl of their dry bak chor mee noodles in a heartbeat! \u00c2\u00a0A definite must try when coming to Singapore!!!!","66":"The queue was pretty short when I dropped by. It was just a 15 minutes wait. Maybe because the regulars knew that the staffs were going for 15-minutes lunch break soon at 2.30pm. I was lucky to be the second last order to be made before the break.Orders that cannot be completed by 2.30pm would be given a queue number.The serving looked a tab small for S$10 and served with a bowl of seaweed soup. I was not full after finishing it and seem to be lacking of the wow factor. The sauce was a tab bland although not too vinegary. Like that the pig's liver was cooked just right - tender. There's lots of pieces of crispy flat fish in it.","67":"I'm not sure what the hype is, but it's basically a pork noodle bowl (Bak Chor Mee) with minced pork, sliced pork, liver, meatballs, wontons, and salted fish. \u00c2\u00a0It was pretty good tasting but I felt it had way too much going on in it. \u00c2\u00a0Maybe I prefer the simpler dishes I had grown accustomed to during my stay here, but I would say it's not worth going out of your way for. \u00c2\u00a0If you absolutely must go, it's probably best to go during the daytime here.","68":"Whilst making my research on a trip to Singapore, this food stall caught my eye being rated 1 Star in Michelin Guide 2017 for Singapore, also being ranked No. 1 in the World Street Food Masters List 2017. I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup\/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like \"I'll come back one day\". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!","69":"Overrated.Is it significantly better than your average bak chor mee? Yes.Is a tiny handful of noodles (in a deceptively large bowl) good enough to be worth $6 and 0.5-2 hours of your time? No.Say an hour of your time is worth only $8. Would you pay $10-22 for this bowl of noodles (if it meant no queueing up)? If not, then what are you doing here?","70":"I think most Westerners need to be careful with this Michelin Star as it isn't for many taste palates. It is definitely worth a try but I spoke to many foreigners who didn't like the dish. I arrived at 2:30 on a weekday and there was practically no line\/queue. I ordered the $6 bowl and watched the magic happen with the food.I agree, the noodles are extra springy with a beautiful texture. Otherwise, even for me, the liver was a bit strong for my taste. I still finished my portion fairly quickly and was still hungry so got myself another order. :)If you can do so, come between the peak hours and just try it out!","71":"1 hour wait for this one Michelin star bak chor mee noodles! Pretty good time if you ask me.This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing! The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good! Comes with a cup of liver\/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters. Would defos come back if I were in Singapore again!","72":"Well, it's good, but to come specially for this place - there are so many good eating places in Singapore- so again - I enjoyed my dish - but unless you really coming around 17:00 - when the q is quit short - I wouldn't bother","73":"Lured by a shining Michelin star, we queued up behind 25 minutes of other patrons.In short, this joint has a lot of hype, it admirably tries to fulfill that hype, but at the end of the day, it's a mom and pop spot serving authentic, cultural noodle dishes on a thin margin. In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost. \u00c2\u00a0The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor. \u00c2\u00a0The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers. Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish. \u00c2\u00a0After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know. \u00c2\u00a0In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold.","74":"dear sweet fanciful moses this was the best bowl of noodles I've ever had. \u00c2\u00a0I normally like the toppings better than noodles in noodle dishes because I'm not a huge carbs person, but I ate an entire large bowl of these. \u00c2\u00a0They are perfectly fresh al dente goodness with theeee best flavor to them. \u00c2\u00a0I also usually shy away from liver but this tasted.. less... livery? lol. \u00c2\u00a0Sorry for the lame description. \u00c2\u00a0Much foodie. \u00c2\u00a0The dried fish bits were my favorite! \u00c2\u00a0Sounds gross but yum I could've eaten a bag of those like chips on their own.I got in line at 10:50 am on a Sunday and still waited 45 minutes in a line of mayyyybe 20 people. \u00c2\u00a0They really take their time and make each bowl perfectly. \u00c2\u00a0I would honestly queue up for that long again. \u00c2\u00a0It was completely worth it. \u00c2\u00a0I'm sure it's only going to get busier as they've been awarded a Michelin star so go early to avoid sweating your ass off in a line all day.Go for the large $10 bowl. \u00c2\u00a0I don't have a huge appetite and I still finished the large bowl fine. \u00c2\u00a0If you're gonna queue for that long, go big or go home :) Went great with a $1.50 iced lemon tea from the stall right next to it!","75":"Mee Is WorthyThe results are in and all the culinary buzz in Singapore has been filled with nothing but the official Singapore Michelin Guide, about who's worthy and who's not. I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins.","76":"Woot! Michelin Star food for $6!Here's a tip, if you go at 8am, you can get a number and have your spot saved in line. Then come back at 9:30 (when they open) and wait for your number to be called.I had number 23 and my number wasn't called till almost 11. (the stand also primarily speak in Chinese ).I got the Bak Chor Mee and the soup base is really the most awesome part of the dish. The dish is spicy\/tangy so definitely more of an acquired taste for some people.","77":"This changes your expectations of a Michelin star meal. Firstly you have to be ok waiting for 45 minutes in line. The noodles were good made of all different forms of pork but my favorites was still the basic meatballs. If you look at this as a bowl of noodles in isolation it was ok, what made it special was the effort the noodles seemed to take juxtaposed with the price.","78":"The Michelin Star wasn't awarded for the late afternoon one hour wait or shabby looking exterior. Endure the wait, though, and you'll get an incredible bowl of Pork noodles. I asked for $10, dry - and it was phenomenal. The noodles were perfectly cooked, supplemented by a refreshing soup. If you can endure the wait - bring water - you'll be rewarded.","79":"Meh, I thought the noodle was very mediocre and missed any flavor. Not worth it for me.","80":"My friends and I pretty much ordered their entire menu. \u00c2\u00a0The wet style noodles were simple, flavorful pork base broth look funn. \u00c2\u00a0 This same soup was used in the seaweed soup and the meatball soup. \u00c2\u00a0The dry style noodles had some spicy, vinegar mixture with yellow flat noodles. \u00c2\u00a0The dry style mixture wasn't overpowering amd it was well controlled. Out of all the dishes my favorite was the meatballs, because the juice of the meat seemingly burst as you bite into it, the pork flavors fills your palates as it travels. \u00c2\u00a0The only thing is the line is terrible, I personally wouldn't stand in line again.","81":"I'm of Chiu chow descent so trust me when I tell you I love love love bak chor mee. We came here right before it opened to get a number tag for the cue. We made it about 10 mins before they opened and got #9. The whole wait time was about 20-30 mins. Definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders. Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line. It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it. \u00c2\u00a0You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though. The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me. There isn't a lot of meat but most dishes don't come with a lot of meat in south east Asia. We also got the meatball soup! Yummy! I would definitely come back as long as I could avoid the lines. Definitely go a little earlier, even if it's like 2 minutes. The line gets long, fast!","82":"Don't need much review. This place has enough five stars. The first Michelle star pork noodle in the world. So proud that our singapore hawker food made it to the Michelle star. Remains as my top choice if I have the time to queue!","83":"I am definitely a fan of the food, but not the line for it. Unfortunately, it has gotten even more popular with the Michelin Star, hence it was one hour and forty minutes line up time for my friends. Perhaps, they can open up a second store somewhere else as I seriously want to go back and have this soon!! X.X","84":"We had the Bak Chor Mee. Nice.","85":"Review for Nov2016 - Queue is long (about 1hr) during the lunch hour, but would definitely come here. Came with a friend and had both variants of the noodles and it was definitely worth the wait and would come back again","86":"not quite sure that this hawker stand lived up to the 1-michelin star hype in my book...me and justin b. showed up on a tuesday afternoon around 2pm hoping to catch the in between lunch\/dinner lull, but i guess everyone else had the same idea b\/c the line was at least 30-40 people deep when we showed up. the line moves so slow and its kind of a bummer there's no limit to the amount of food that 1 person can order so you may see a single person ahead of you that buys like 6 bowls of food and with the hot\/humid singapore weather and only a few fans in the area to cool you down...waiting in line is not a fun experience haha. the only redeeming thing is that there is a drink stand next door where you can get a cold soda to help cool down or order food from the other stalls to satisfy your hunger pains haha...we ended up waiting 2 hours for our bowl of food :( upon first bite of the bak chor mee, i wasnt immediately wow-ed. the whole sweet\/sour\/tangy flavor combination isnt my favorite...but as i continued to eat, my bowl of noodles, pork, dumplings, and fish balls grew on me and i liked the flavors more and more with each bite. i think we ordered the $8 SGD bowl which is about $5ish USD and for that price point, its still a great deal and value. i had never had bak chor mee before this experience and i'm glad i got to experience this dish while in singapore...but i cannot justify this 2-hour wait.","87":"singapore is never short of cheap and good food. but when it comes to having awesome nosh, singaporeans will need to scour every single nook and crany for the best. When you feel like chowing down on a good bowl of pork noodle (Bak Chor Mee as we would call it), please come here. The queue during lunch might be a little daunting, so try to come down during off peak hours but even during off peak, one can expect to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes to see the front of the queue. So don't come famished but almost hungry. :)Remember the soup nazi from Seinfeld? Well, we do have an experience with the whole ordering process. You will have to order in a particular sequence - price of the bowl you want, type of noodle, dry or soup and then all the misc special request (less spicy, more vinegar, no liver etc). If in a group, please remember to order per bowl. so don't go like \"2 bowls of $5 mee pok, no chill\" - you will be left #ignored. When your bowl is presented to you, you will be glad you actually waited. the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee. you have the minced pork, the liver slices, the singluar meatball, that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop. Mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite. The accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like! (till the next time I go back).So to have some authentic pork noodle, come down here and get an awesome bowl or two! Please invite me along the next time anyone is going down and I will be glad to join you in enjoying an awesome bowl of bak chor mee!","88":"China style noodles! Definitely order a large bowl. You have to wait a long time so might as well eat more. :)","89":"So this place received a gazillion accolades Michelin star being one among them. Expect lineups at 4PM as well, you've 3 dishes to choose from, but overall didn't care too much for mine, just walked away from mine after eating 2\/3rds of it. But at these provrsx(10$ and under) worth the try if line up isn't too long.","90":"Had a similar Pork noodle 20 years ago when I was in singapore and thought wanna try one this time during my formula one visit. Friend recommended to me this Michelin one star rated noodle shop. Expected to wait for an hour but guess what, we have waited for 2 full hours for this noodles! The noodle itself was very good but definitely I will never wait this long again for this!!!","91":"Like others before me have said, if you can get past waiting in line for 30 mins on average (and upwards of 1hr during peak hours and days), then you're in for a real treat. I ordered the much talked about pork noodles with the broth on the side, and it was absolutely delicious. While I have had noodles of this style elsewhere, I have never tried it with the unique vinegar sauce mixture that the chef so craftily pours over the fresh noodles which are made on site.All in all, this is a great example of a local gem!","92":"Its a one michelin star place.. went there with high expectations. The line wasn't too bad as compared to the previous two famous carts I'd been to. I just didn't like the noodles, the texture and taste is something I just didn't enjoy. That being said, you should still give it a try, I'm pretty sure most people standing in line really enjoyed it.","93":"Definitely one of the best Mee Pok I have tasted in Singapore.Nice chewy al dented style of egg noodles mixed in with pork lard, soy sauce and chilli.Definitely worth a bite if you have the time to stand in line for at least 30 minutes","94":"Favorite fan of Bak Chor Mee forever. Heard about this no. 1 BC mee and it's snaking queue. Hence tried it today. Ordered a $10 & $6, after queueing for 45mins. Extremely disappointed. Noodles is thick and not so springy. \u00c2\u00a0Ingredients are fresh. Base sauce is so so. Overall not really worth the price and time. Doubtful will come and queue again.Advice to owner is that he should concentrate on cooking instead of also being the cashier. Hence undercooked noodles.","95":"Queued for approximately an hour and a half a week after the Michelin announcement.I came with a huge expectation and, to be perfectly honest, was left pretty disappointed by the dish. Although the noodle base was undoubtedly unique, I found the noodle and other ingredients very normal and forgettable. Then again, I do admit that I have never been a fan of Bak Chor Mee.This stall (barely) deserves its one star due to its incredible noodle base; however, I will probably not come back anytime soon.","96":"AMAZING.i was taken here not knowing what bak chor mee even was, nor what awaited me. my delicate californian constitution could not handle the heat and 1 hour 10 min wait in line to get my food, but damn, was all that worth it! (it helped that i waited in line with 2 lovely ladies).this bak chor mee was delicious. chilli, vinegar, and perfectly QQ noodles!didn't really care about the wonton, but the pork and liver were delicious (although i wish there were more).i can't really compare to other bak chor mee, since i'm a novice, but i know good food, and this was good food.","97":"If you like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is the place for you. If you don't like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is still the place for you. Whenever I'm away from Singapore, I have dreams about this bowl of goodness. Haters can nitpick all they want, but IMMA LET YOU FINISH, BUT THIS IS THE BEST BAK CHOR MEE OF ALL TIME.","98":"I've not had vinegary mee pok before. There, I said it. What's with the judgey looks, people? Geez!So I embarked upon a mee pok trail, and this was one of those die die must tries. We got there slightly before 11am, and a wild queue of 18-20 people greets us. Curses! Still, we duly wait, as dining companion really likes her mee pok. Fast forward about 40mins later, it's finally our turn and we both end up with mee kia as it turns out, while she likes mee pok, the mee pok noodles here are too doughy for her liking. And it's true, even the mee kia seems pudgier than those elsewhere, and these upsized strands have a less QQ bite than I'd prefer. Sad.Vinegar hit is ok, neither too subtle nor overpowering. The chilli leans towards the mild side, and the ingredients are mostly meaty stuff- one wanton, one meat ball, some minced pork, pork slices and liver. A bit measly, really. You know the episode where Karl Pilkington goes to China, and when he treks the wall and goes 'it's not a Great wall. It's an alright wall. It's the Alright Wall of China.'? Yup, for me, it's just an alright bowl of noodles. Plus the ridiculous wait.. I think not.","99":"According to Teochew Ah Pa, the price has gone up with inflation. Now the smallest bowl is $5 and we ordered 3 bowls of dry BCM, 2 Mee Kia and 1 Mee Pok. The queue is of course, very long as always.Alas, the much-awaited BCM came up and yes, it was the same old taste that we've had previously. It does not hold back on vinegar and seasonings, and thus give a satisfying kick which lures you back for more.No pork lard but crispy pieces of flatfish still works for us. My family love our BCM the spicy way but their plain version is equally competent. You can self service to more vinegar if you like.That said, we noted a problem this time round. Too much sodium in the wanton dumplings and also noodles. I did not remember the food being so heavily seasoned the last time (or my memory must be failing......) But it could also be this distinctive taste or that keeps the business going so well after many years.Indeed, we got thirsty hours after the meal. But well, once-in-a-blue-moon bowl of comforting and satisfying Bak Chor Mee won't hurt too much.","100":"As a tourist from the US who generally likes Asian noodle dishes I was intrigued by the favorable reviews of this eatery. And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1\/4 mile NE of Raffles) that, in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.It was fortunate that I had written down \"bak chor mee\" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile.","101":"Each time I think of Bak Chor Mee, I dutifully make my way down to this stall to get my fix.Springy noodles cooked al dente style (chinese version) with lots of tasty tiiny meat chunks, meat balls, salted fish tossed in a delicious blend of vinegar, chilli, soya sauce and oil!There's liver too but I always opt out of that.Best ever - not two thumbs up but 10 fingers up!","102":"A really unassuming establishment until you see how popular it is by the line that forms. \u00c2\u00a0Tai Hwa isn't a popular hawker center like Newton's or Maxwell's but it is really a gem! When I first got my bowl, I was thinking \"this is it for $6?\" but it really is a small bowl of quality goodness. \u00c2\u00a0Every single item is thoughtfully crafted and placed as an integral part of a whole. \u00c2\u00a0Their preparation is arguably inefficient; however, you won't argue any longer once you eat it! \u00c2\u00a0Always get the pork noodles, dry. \u00c2\u00a0It sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and the noodles are FRESH. \u00c2\u00a0As in, they are handmade (at least that's what it seems) and cooked upon order. \u00c2\u00a0Topping the noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, dry fried fish, etc. \u00c2\u00a0You get a bowl of soup on the side as well.I saw some other people with bigger portions so you can probably get there for extra $$ if you're feeling hungrier or want more goodness.","103":"When my wife asked me why I did not heed the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate recommendation to \"limit refined grains\", I answered, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every bowl of bak chor mee that comes from the coffee shop on Crawford Lane.'\"I had to put it down in writing on Yelp before I could order my extra large bowl of bak chor mee.","104":"It must be a good day for me as I didn't have to Q for a long time. \u00c2\u00a0I think the noodle used to be better, now, it's simply too overrated. \u00c2\u00a0I have tasted better and hope Tai Hwa will return to the standard it used to have when it was at Hill Street.","105":"A lot of newspapers, articles, etc about this place. One ridiculous article i found was posted right in front of the cashier, which says about two men fighting due to the queuing and police came to reconcile. waited for 20 mins, they normally had one lady take your order first and then the old man cooking. he used many bowls by putting some little meat, soup in every bowl and then dump to another place. he never ended up using that same bowl for serving. i really had no idea what he was doing. all the meat like pork and pork liver were raw. he basically just put the soup in it so it cooked by itself. the noodles are quite normal, the soup bowl on the side was very fatty and oily, the flavor is just vinegar plus spicy sauce. i don't see why it is so famous or special.","106":"I am not a fan of Bak Chor Mee and I find the Bak Chor Mee here average. But people who love it are queuing an average of 20-30 minutes for the food. From own experience of queuing, I deduced that the wait is long and the queue is slow because the person preparing the the food seem slow..Further observing the preparation prove I am right but that is because they treat their food seriously. Even though I am not their fan, I have friends around me who are and they make it a point to go all the way to Larvender MRT to have it. Those who are interested can try for themselves and they are open most of the days from 9.30am to 9pm except 1st and 3rd Monday of each month.","107":"The best minced pork noodle in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0The noodle is cooked just al dente ..... most other hawkers in Singapore tend to over-cook their noodles but not this chap. \u00c2\u00a0The morsels of meat are also cooked just right, tender, juicy and succulent. \u00c2\u00a0This just shows to me that a lot of attention to detail has gone into cooking that bowl of noodle.Expensive for a bowl of hawker noodle but well worth the price. \u00c2\u00a0The only pet peeve I have for this place is the long wait. \u00c2\u00a0Budget for at least an hour of queuing. \u00c2\u00a0Is it worth the wait ..... hmm, the jury is still out as I really dislike having to stand in line and wait for my food. \u00c2\u00a0But, if you want to try the best \"bak chor mee\" in Singapore, this is the place!","108":"Nothing else is comparable to the noodles here. This is evidenced by the long lines every day, and I do mean every day! We were there at 10.30am on a wednesday and there is a line of 10 persons! Once we joined the line, 5 more were behind us immediately!Tip: morning is cooked by the boss himself, lunch hour his \"sous-chef\", dinner another worker. I only go when it is either the boss himself or the sous-chef. It is all in the number of nano-seconds the noodle is cooked! Yes, technicalities of Asian hawker food!","109":"Tiny hawker stand with only three items on their menu. Heard the line can get crazy. We went around 3 hoping no one would be there but still had to wait about 10-15 mins. Not bad. They have a dry noodle, a soup noodle and a beef ball soup. My husband got the dry noodle and I got the soup noodle. It is interesting how you pick a size by $ amount and not small medium or large. Every stands in line on the left where you pick up food and the guy will call you up to the right side to place your order. My husband loved his dry noodle. My soup noodle was just so so. Dry noodle definitely tasted a lot better. I would never wait an hour for the soup noodle.","110":"Totally worth the wait and everytime I've been here, there will definitely be a wait.The crispy fried flatfish is what makes all TW difference for this bcm.Order a bowl of too soft but nonetheless tasty dumpling soup to round off your meal after all that waiting!","111":"First things first, the queue is VERY LONG. And it's not those fast moving queue, so you do need quite a bit of patience if you want to get a taste of this bar chor mee!My friend told me that the 'dry' one is what people think is the better one, so I tried it. But in my humble opinion, the soup one actually taste better overall. Nothing very spectacular in my opinion, so I'm not very sure if I'll come back, especially with such a long queue.............","112":"This stall was previously located in Marina Sq Food Court and always has a long queue for the bak chor mee. Even foreigners that come here want to try the noodles before they return to their countries.The special feature is the Chilli sauce and the flavourful soup! Their pig's liver is also done very nicely. Cooked for just the right amount of time, resulting is tender slices of liver heaven. I was sort of shocked when i saw that the whole bowl was filled with oil, but i was told that this is actually the yardstick for all Bak Chor Mees in Singapore. Anyway, i was not disappointed with the taste, not too salty and very flavourful with just a highlight of sourness coming from the vinegar.I also liked the fried bits of lard and the liver bits, which wasn't too overpowering and given in the correct amount. The crispy fish was also a nice addition to the usual bak chor mee dish. A must try.","113":"I have lived away for some 12 years and every time i come backto Singapore, which is about twice a year, i head straight here, the morning after my arrival, for my fav authentic hawker food. Each time, the noodles do not disappoint. The secret is in the mix: \u00c2\u00a0the sacue is sufficiently vinegary and sweet and sallty, the ingredients are fresh and of good quality, and the noodles are always cooked just right. What really seals the deal for me is the stock which is amazing, Over the years the prices have escalated so that my visit each time runs up a bill close to $50, for two persons eating there and a to go order for three at home. Notwithstanding the prohibitive cost I return. MY one complaint right now is that for to go orders, they do not offer you the soup sp you have to purchase a soup bowl to go!","114":"I'd known before making my way down to Lavender that Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles was a popular bak chor mee stall, with some food bloggers going so far as to claim that it was the best bak chor mee stall in Singapore. I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here.Um sadly. Wasn't impressed.I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted.I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day.Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm.","115":"This is so underwhelming. I can't believe I queued 40 minutes for this during lunch time! It was time to see what's the fuss about when I decided to join the snaking queue in this coffeeshop tucked away in a sleepy estate of Crawford Lane. All I can say is I don't see what is so special about it. Add in the waiting time and I feel cheated. The noodles were quite stiff and starchy, and there was so much sole fish in it and too little minced pork.I had a better time with the homemade iced lemon tea from the same coffeeshop - be sure to order that if you need to try the noodles!","116":"Delicious minced meat noodles, but on the pricey side, starts from $5 to $10 a bowl. Not sure what lies in the $10 bowl but taste wise, it hits the BCM spot all the time. Long queues expected but moderately fast.","117":"Delicious minced meat noodles, love e vinegar taste and the liver was cook very well. However for the long queue, might not have the patience to wait.","118":"The best minced pork noodle I have ever had. Other minced pork noodles no longer satisfy my cravings anymore since I have had this many years ago. Today, the noodles still taste as good as it was in the past. Love the fried flatfish and the wanton that comes with it.","119":"Hands down the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore. When it comes to flavor and freshness, Tai Hwa is hard to beat. Some people prefer their Bak Chor Mee to incorporate tomato based sauce, but my tastes are more aligned to the vinegar \/ chili heavy mix that Tai Hwa cooks up. The wontons, liver, meatballs and dried salted fish give the extra \"oomph\" that make the noodles truly a complete dish.","120":"Fave bcm in town! but be prepared to queue for this, usually it will take me around 30-45 mins depending on the length of the queue and how many orders per person.","121":"Not sure what else I can say other than that this is most definitely the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore.Once you can get past the queue in this little kopitiam, you'll finally find yourself holding onto a bowl of the most perfectly cooked noodles, doused in a casually good vinegar base. One of the best parts of this is how well cooked their minced and sliced pork is - soo tender and juicy considering how fine they are. The pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it, and to crown it off, they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish, which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl. One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination! The soup on the side is so well brewed as well, you can actually taste the pork from which the flavour comes from. None of that artificial flavouring that we frown upon, I don't think!","122":"I accidentally found this place. I had a pork noodle. The portion of food is quite too big for a girl like me. The taste is unique and delicious. Love it!!","123":"Be prepared to queue. It is worth it. Is there a better pork noodle out there? Nope there never will be","124":"Hands down the best bak chor mee in Singapore! I love the vinegar with the chilli and so much porky goodness in the soup! Super long queue so make sure you bring some entertainment! Wait times can be up to one hour at peak times.","125":"One of my favourite restaurants here in Singapore. The quirky area, the decor, the ambiance whisks me away as if I was on holiday in Latin America. \u00c2\u00a0I really love it here. \u00c2\u00a0The food is delicious and presented beautifully, and it reminds me of restaurants back home in Los Angeles.Some of my favourite dishes:*Avocado Wasbi Tuna Tartare- amazing. Fresh, delicious, balanced, and quite authentic. Craving fresh tartare, ceviche, etc. frequently, I really do get my fix here. Highly recommended*Slow Cooked beef Short Ribs- tender, juicy, flavorful. Just wish there was more on the plate!*Seared Scallops in Mushroom Sauce- scallops cooked perfectly and the earthiness of heartiness of the mushrooms really pack a punch*Rocket & Iberico Pizza- AWESOME!. Love this.*Pork Belly with Purple Mash- Another delicious and tender creation. I could eat this all day! The crackling is a bit too hard for me, but it sure packs a crunch.Order a bottle of wine, and you are set for a great date place. Beware of the reservations though- they are always full, but if you book in advance, you will not be disappointed!","126":"Great fusion food here, with prices on the high side, in a non air-conditioned environment in the Kallang Riverside Park area. We had the duck salad, pork belly, and snapper main to share, washed down with some house red. This is a small-plates sort of place, where you share things. The ingredient combinations here are refreshing and interesting, and I quite liked everything in general.The ambience is however, a bit iffy because it can get quite stuffy\/humid. Come here on a cool day\/night. I cannot imagine having lunch here if I was perspiring slightly at dinner. The place gets packed at dinner, even on a Monday, so make a booking prior.","127":"We ended up here after the restaurant we intended to eat at was closed (always call ahead!!) The food was on the pricey side (S$214.20 for 5 adults, no alcohol), but unexpectedly tasty.We had:SaladsDuck and Pomelo SaladBeetroot SaladMainsSoftshell CrabBBQ RibletsEbiko PastaSnapper MilaneseSquid Ink RiceDessertChurrosFortune CookieParticularly outstanding was the softshell crab that came with a rich curry sauce, the squid ink rice and the BBQ Riblets (generous portion).The target demographic is certainty not families with children - while they were happy to have us with kids in tow, they did not have high chairs or kids' utensils.Last but not least, I get that the open-air concept is part of the ambiance, but in Singapore, that can sometimes be a bane.","128":"YUM! Come with friends. There is so much that you'll want to try. Service was perfect. Friendly and attentive staff. Sadly I came alone so I wasn't able to get everything I had my eye on (especially the Thai tea creme caramel ). The black and white prawn ravioli was beyond perfect. Soooo good! I also had the duck and pomelo salad which was great as well. Great music as well!","129":"Pretty much every dish we ordered was yummy! Price tag is pretty high though, especially for such an out of the way place.. Docked one star for that. Happily, it was a company event and so I didn't pay and we got to try a variety of things :)Appetizers\/(\"To share\"):1. Rocket parma pizza ($26) - nice thin crust, I'm not a huge fan of parma so no comments on that. 2. BBQ riblets ($20) - quite a substantial amt of ribs! and parmesan rosemary potatoes which were a bit undercooked, I think. at least, there was quite some bite to them that I don't really expect from potatoes.3. Seared scallops w sweet mushroom reduction ($23) - four delicious scallops! The sauce was really pretty sweet, surprisingly. I have a sweet tooth so this was by far my favourite! I wonder if there was any wine in the reduction. Anyway, nice juicy mushrooms and a cherry tomato, mm.4. Crispy salt and pepper squid ($15) - normal. I guess fried stuff just appealed to my colleagues :p Also it came recommended by the server.Mains:1. Balsamic Duck Leg w Butter Parsnip Mash and Sesame Asparagus ($30) - my dish! Mmm. Very tender and sweet balsamic reduction. I couldn't tell parsnip from potato though, shrugs. Some bits of parsnip in the mash, pretty nice change in texture. 2. Day night pork belly ($29) - came recommended by server. I didn't taste this but colleagues said it was good!3. Tenderloin w herb butter and cabernet reduction, roasted pumpkin + goat cheese quinoa, vege skewer ($39) - by far the most expensive item on the menu. Really tender beef! And the reduction was delicious. Quinoa was so-so, nothing special. 4. Squid ink rice w prawns, squid, egg ($25) - I thought this was quite value-for-$, was surprised there were quite a few ingredients to this dish! Colleague loved it. She did have to contend with black lips\/teeth after though :p Oh, and the rice was slightly spicy, very intriguing.Saw a few others having the lambrack, looked like quite a lot of stuff on the plate! I guess it does also cost $36.. Anyway, we sadly had no time for dessert, although I would've loved to try their ice cream. Maybe next time! Ambiance was nice, surprisingly it wasn't too hot although open-air, guess there were a LOT of fans blowing. Can kind of see Kallang River, pretty cool. Also, on the second floor of this one building kind of in the middle of nowhere, not much signage. Cool decor!","130":"There is a reason Kilo is so popular - they serve delicious food executed perfectly.I was lucky enough to attend a large dinner here so we got to try a little of everything. \u00c2\u00a0I was happier and happier with every dish. \u00c2\u00a0It's so great to find a nice, chill restaurant and enjoy it with a group of friends.The FoodThe ebiko pasta is pure decadence. Thin vermicelli is covered in a cream sauce and a roe sauce toped off with the most perfectly cooked shrimp. \u00c2\u00a0Another favorite dish was the duck with mango and pomelo - it was a subtle pairing of salty, citrus, and fresh flavors. \u00c2\u00a0I was surprised at how much I liked it! \u00c2\u00a0All the other dishes we tried were well executed - fork tender beef cheek, refreshing and tangy tuna tartare, appropriately spicy chicken bulgogi , and perfectly cooked fish paired with some of the best brussel sprouts I've ever tasted. \u00c2\u00a0The lava cake is a textbook lava cake (which is a good thing) and oozes with the most delicious chocolate filling.The Verdict?Definitely visit and eat here at least once. \u00c2\u00a0Just remember to plan in advance (hard I know) and your taste buds won't be disappointed.","131":"Japanese Fusion restaurants are not a thing unheard of lately, with every launch boasting a uniqueness that is slowly becoming commonplace. Quietly located in a 2 story retired factory building, Kilo takes us back to the charm & allure of our very first fusion dining experience. Its open-air laid-back atmosphere and casually dressed staff offer a sense of warmth and comfort while its minimalistic art & interiors echo a hint of character and sophistication. The menu channels the identity of its predecessor, Raw Kitchen Bar, where owners Sharon & Javier hooked us onto their creativity. With a plethora of Japanese - Italian dishes, each tickling the taste buds more than the next, the real draw was the Figs topped with Danish blue cheese, roasted walnuts & bacon. The sweetness of the Figs paired with the saltiness of the bacon and creamy texture of the blue cheese was spectacular. The 12-Hour Roasted Pork Belly was no less; tongue-caressingly soft and perfectly complimented with the purple mash, its rich flavors were hard to beat. The Tune Tartare & Ceviche platter added the familiarity of our favorite fusion dishes to this quaint oasis; Kilo has proven to be the highly impressive sister of Raw - personable, un-gimmicky and vivacious from the very first bite.","132":"Located next to the breezy Kallang River, Kilo is quite a charming spot, being one a second level of a warehouse-like building, completely raw and void of lavish decorations except for some rugs and an eclectic mix of tables and chairs.We got ourselves seated at the bar and started off the meal with Mango Tuna Poke and Wonton Chips, only cause the voyeuristic me send many virtual thumbs up for this dish. We dug in for our first bite, a pregnant pause and then, one of my dinner mates announced, \"I don't eat raw tuna... but this is GOOD.\" This was made of raw tuna, fresh mangoes and cucumber in a mix of savoury, sweet and crunchy.We also ordered a serving of Grilled Portobello Mushroom served with Potato Strips. Thick, juice and succulent baked with the savoury sin of oozing cheese and topped with tangy salsa.Chilli Prawn Pizza \u00c2\u00a0arrived and we eyed the chilli padis on it cautiously. We each too a slice and bit into the slice of indulgence. A marker of a good pizza is a good balance of the bite of the pizza base, the softness of the cheese, the sauce and ingredients. This was so amazing, we ordered this twice. The juicy prawns was heightened by the flavourful paste and paired lovely with the pizza base with the basil leaves breaking the bites with a little spice. Very asian, very awesome. This is fusion well-done.With fusion cuisine having the tendency of trying too hard, I think many are often disappointed with what is offered. I was happy to find Kilo, working with Asian flavours the best they are presented and modernizing them with Western ways to serving. You'll love this one.","133":"I'd probably say this is one of the better 'European' dining I've had in Singapore.. the menu largely consists of small plates (good for sharing between four) and about 6-8 main dishes to share from. We mainly stuck to the shared plates and budgeted about 1.5 plates per person. The great dishes? The chilli and prawn pizza - great base and \u00c2\u00a0good hit of spiceThe tuna tartar (although no taste of wasabi that was promised on the menu...)The portabello mushrooms - fresh and tastyThe squid ink rice with squid and prawns - liked the egg yolk on top, nice touchThe salt and pepper squid - not as peppery as i'd like but plenty of squidSo-so?Ceviche (I've had some pretty good ceviche in my time and felt this was lacking in flavour and spice)The gyoza (kinda felt like it was a fried pancake with gyoza hidden at the bottom... didn't do it for me)Quinoa salad... just meh. Very limited beer menu (2 choices) and desserts, boo. The lava cake with icream is tasty and good value, but don't do the apple and carrot icecream as one of our fellow diners did... feels like you're detoxing at dessert. Felt like the restaurant has good ambience and although it feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, it's actually very close to bugis. The view is nicer as it gets dark so you only have the view of lights on water rather than a drain and a dirty river! Alfresco style on the 2nd floor but doesn't get hot with the river breeze and fans keeping the humidit at bay. Service is really efficient and helpful without being overbearing. They were able to split the bill three ways which I appreciate. We spent $55 per person and were well stuffed by the end of it. The most similar restaurant I've been to is Artichoke for its tapas-share style menu and I felt this restaurant was MUCH better than artichoke (despite the more limited wine and dessert menu!). I would definitely go back with friends. Recommend.","134":"This is my favoritest restaurant in Singapore. By a light year. Seriously, I lurve it.I heard about Kilo from my boss at work. It almost made me not want to go: he said it was in a rundown building in the middle of nowhere, no air-con, and to boot, I'm not sure that I really trust his palate. Boy am I glad that I tried it.So, yes, it's not in a conventional boring mall as everything is in Singapore but I think it adds to the charm. The building it's in is set back on from the road and walking distance from the Lavender stop. There's no air-con but ample fans going to keep you cool. It's a swank restaurant, I think. It's got an easy, non-pretentious vibe to it, abstract art hanging up on the wall, cacti decor - it's one of those places you just feel hipper or more interesting sitting in.Now to the menu. There's tons of seafood options on it. When I go, I usually make it as far as the appetizers. It's all shareable. And I love tapas-style dining. I'm not sure that I would call it Japanese Italian or whatever - it's just effing good food. There's a ceviche platter that's to DIE for. It's got tuna, salmon, and octopus ceviches and the taste so rightly fresh and citrusy. Last time I went with friends, we chowed down and ordered seconds. There's also the ribs that fall off of the bone. Tell your grandma that she can leave her dentures at home for this one. And then the scallops that come in a mushroomy-marsala sauce you should definitely order. The sauce on it is so buttery and delicious. You'll be asking for bread to sop it up. Or licking the plate if you're on some weird ass Atkin's BS.Wine list is extensive and priced well. With this list, it makes you wonder why other restaurants in Singapore rape you on their price points. Either that or the owners Sharon and Javier just want to introduce you to some great vino. Either way, you win here.And service is attentive. My water glass was always filled with my lemon infused tap water. Such a nice touch. The only drawback here is that Sharon and Javier, even though they don't advertise and rely on word-of-mouth press from their happy customers, get booked out. So RSVP early! It's worth it. And even then, Sharon (who answers all of the emails or the phone) hates to turn away customers. She told me last time, \"Ohhhh Jason! I'm sorry it took so long to get you in! You know, if you randomly show up, we can try and fit you at the bar.\" God, such hospitality.","135":"Just one floor above popular coffee spot Loysel's Toy, Kilo feels like one of those surprise backlane finds.I met the restaurant owner, Javier, at his previous spot at Upper Bukit Timah. Then called Raw Kitchen Bar, he served food with Japanese, Thai and Italian influences, and he's carried over those flavours to Kilo, to the joy of many of his regulars.The feel is everything: stepping out of the lift (which was already cool -the wooden accents and detailed vent... who does that?), I was greeted with what looked like a grungy New York city loft apartment, except there were a couple dozen chairs around large granite tiles masquerading as tables. So you get the feel that it's a pretty cool spot, doncha?On to the food then... we had a pretty big crew that night, and we might have had most of the menu. Starters included a damn tasty row of scallops topped with a cream sauce, chock full of rough-cut mushrooms, and the signature three-fish ceviche. Did I say damn tasty? Mains were well-executed classics like a braised lamb shank on mega creamy mash. Have to give special mention to the 12-hour pork - GORGEOUS. Meat that almost flakes apart, And that skin. Oh, that crackly, fragrant goodness. It was ridiculous. All that disappeared in a flash. So much for sharing, guys. We'll just have to go back again, I guess.p.s. KILO isn't a reference to weight, but for the nautical signal, which means \"I want to communicate with you\". I had to ask. I'm geeky that way.","136":"It was underwhelming. The restaurant was Hipster-ish with loud music playing in the background. I should have ran out the moment I saw that bicycle by the lift. Alas, my companion and I had a reservation. Out of the 4 starters we shared, one was exceptional (figs with Danish blue), the other was acceptable (zucchini pancake) and the other two were disappointing. The salmon mint sashimi was overpowered by mint and lime, to the extent that you can't taste the salmon anymore. Not a good thing to do with such a tasty fish. Also, portion was really small. Think amuse bouche-sized. But the biggest let down has got to be the beef tartare with quail egg and fries. basically just over seared beef of unexceptional quality, hardly any flavor with a hard-boiled quail egg and thin fries. Incidentally, it was the most expensive item amongst the starters and came highly recommended by fellow yelpers. Maybe we got there on an off day, but this tartare did not come close to others I've tried. Well, we had no mood for mains or dessert after. The bill came up to nearly $100 for just 4 starters. The only dish I can recommend from my kilo experience is the figs with blue cheese.","137":"Opened by the same people who started Raw Food Kitchen, Kilo is a foodie's paradise. Innovative fusion dishes are made with fresh, quality ingredients and cooked with great culinary prowess, ensuring a great experience there.Located on the 2nd level of TURE, the open air restaurant is small and cosy, complete with a bar in the corner. Be sure to make reservations in advance as there is limited seating. Also, do take note that the food takes quite a long time to be served!Their delectable starters are designed to whet the appetite and visually stimulate the consumer. My absolute favorites are the seared scallops with mushroom sauce, the fresh fig with danish blue cheese and avocado tuna wasabi tartare. The pizzas here are of the thin crust variety and not very big, so they are also ideal for sharing as a starter.Going on to the mains, I must say I've tried quite a few of them, so let me give you the lowdown. The balsamic duck leg is basically duck confit with a twist. The balsamic gives it a beautiful flavor. It's very tender and juicy as it's braised. There is also butter mash and asparagus served with it.The 12 hour pork belly never fails to impress. The crackling is crispy and dry, and the dish is served with a yummy purple mash that strangely makes me feel less guilty. The angel hair cream of Ebiko is an interesting fusion, with the ebiko providing a great texture to the pasta. Lastly, the tenderloin served with herb butter and a cabaret reduction sauce is always perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rareness. Still it was probably the least interesting dish, compared to the other items note menu.There is a pretty good selection of wine and drinks to go with your meal. Definitely highly recommended! :)","138":"Overdone on hipster and under cooked in quality. Definitely not \"the best restaurant in Singapore\" or close. \u00c2\u00a0Overrated and disappointing dishes. We had four \"to shares\" at ~$20++ a pop. \u00c2\u00a0We picked them from the waiter's recommendation: Spicy salmon sashimi, beef with quail egg, zucchini pancake and stuffed figs. Salmon sashimi: could not taste the salmon as was overpowered with lime juice and seasoning. They added what appeared to be rice sushi topping on top. Small amount of salmon.Beef with quail egg: \u00c2\u00a0the beef was bland and there was no sauce to add a kick. Quail egg overcooked. Dry bread on the side. \u00c2\u00a0Worst dish of the four.Zucchini pancake: two pancakes with mound of rocket and cream-cheese. Tasty, but nothing exciting.Stuffed figs with bacon: good! six small figs, stuffed with creamy cheese, rocket and bacon. We were still hungry after the four dishes four two people, but given the quality so far, decided to stop there.Ambiance: hipsterish, with a fixed gear bicycle planted in a corner. It gets loud with a full house as the room is relatively small and the floors and roof are concrete, hence bad acoustics. Early on in the night, the owner\/manager\/hip dude was playing music from a DJ set; \u00c2\u00a0music was lousy and too loud. I felt bad for a couple next to the speakers.","139":"I used to be a regular of Raw Kitchen Bar on Upper Bukit Timah, and followed their move to Kampong Bugis under the new moniker of Kilo. It's definitely changed, particularly in terms of the general vibe and style, but the food at Kilo is still excellent Japanese fusion fare and the flavours have continued to be exciting and fresh. My only gripe is that, in comparison to Raw which had a large setting that included a lush outdoor area, the new space at Kilo is much smaller and feels comparatively cramped. It certainly is more intimate and exclusive now, but I do miss those days at Raw and the amazing set-up they had. Nevertheless, this still remains one of my favourites in Singapore at the moment for excellent casual dining.","140":"Last night I played host to the first Girl's Night our group has had in a long time. I have met a number of new women in the past couple of months and wanted to introduce them to all my friends. Also, a number of women are leaving in the next few months and I want to make sure we spend some quality time together before then. But beyond all these practical reasons, the universe was telling me to try this new restaurant: Kilo.So as women are want to do we gabbed for 3 hours, moving around the table to chat with new people, sharing bites of food, complimenting each other's jewelry. To be quite frank I was most surprised the whole evening that 1. I have 10 girl friends in Singapore and 2. All the women I invited came!Sure enough, everyone loved it. The dining room was open and furnished sparsely with sleek teak chairs and glass topped tables. If you had put the New York skyline behind the expansive windows we would have believed we were in Dumbo because it was so much like a loft. The first wine recommendation was a Pinot Noir, earning Kilo them some points. I must say everything looked tasty on the menu so I'm going to make a few trips to explore it. Last night I went for the scallops to start and then the duck leg. The scallops were very tender, almost underdone, but the sauce atop them was amazing. My duck leg was expertly cooked (unlike some of the tenderloin going around the table) but I felt the balsamic reduction masked some of the flavor and made the skin soggy. It also came with mashed potatoes [super tasty] and asparagus [love].After we closed the bill and emptied the fifth bottle of Pinot, the majority of women left and four diehards had dessert. My Penguin's Lemon Tart was so delicious and made me want to remake the lemon squares I had dishes up recently. Who knew fresh basil on whip cream was so good.Definitely need to repeat Girls' Night and Kilo soon.","141":"Kilo is certainly off the beaten path, but a path I am glad we found. Some friends suggested Kilo after reading about it in some guidebooks and magazines. \u00c2\u00a0They made reservations for an early dinner on Saturday night. My husband and I pulled up in our uber. The uber driver said, \"Are you sure this is the place?\" Honestly, we were not sure. Fortunately, it was the place. Kilo is on the 2nd floor and the Kilo Lounge is on the 8th floor. We arrived early so we went up to the lounge for a drink. They told us to come back in 15 minutes (which was fine). We went downstairs and my husband had a beer at the coffee shop, Loysel's Toy, on the first floor. After a few minutes, we went back up to the Lounge. The staff was very welcoming. My husband had a beer and I had a glass of rose. We laughed at the decor. My husband said it looked like some college fraternity guys said, \"Let's open a bar\/restaurant and just use the furniture we already have!\" But, never judge a book by it's cover, right? After finishing drinks we went downstairs to Kilo. We met our friends and were promptly seated at our table. We ordered some cocktails. I had sangria for my first round which was very good, but I went with wine for my second round. Kilo gives a nice big pour unlike many places in Singapore. We were told by the waiter that dishes were made to share. We ordered the tuna and wasabi, a sushi roll, seared scallops, a grilled romaine salad, a fig and walnut salad, the pork belly and the ribs. Honestly, every bit of it was absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. The pork belly and the ribs were the true standout. I would go back and order two orders of each. The only reason why Kilo did not earn 5 stars is that the portion sizes are really small. I can't say that I left really full, but it was very tasty and we will be back!","142":"He heard a lot about this place, so there is always an expectation that it could be a let down. Happy to say that it lives up to the hype and reputation. Great food, excellent service and a cool layout. Nothing singularly stands out, and everything we had was flavoursome and enjoyable. The lounge upstairs is homely and has some nice comfy couches. Certainly going back!","143":"Here's a place I can get great flavours and textures even if they appear 'common' at first fight. The grilled scallops with a good rich mushroom ragout ( if I get this right) had the sweet, savoury balance and the right textures of perfectly cooked scallops. Luckily, there's more than just one for each even if you shared it out!Here at Kilo, you will see plenty of 'skins' used as crisp for garnishing and they are sinful delights that I excuse myself for relishing. It's afterall once in a blue moon, or maybe not. Once, I dined at kilo twice in a week with the lovely sous vide pork belly and the feta pumpkin rocket salad. One of the items that stuck with me is the purple yukon mash. Silky, creamy and purple, great visual effects and gastronomical bliss all at once.For more of such Japanese Italian fusion cuisine, you will have to try it for yourself. They also have a good selection of wines and beverages to keep to relaxed all night!","144":"We attended a private function at Kilo yesterday and just the appetizers alone were phenomenal! This place is truly a hidden gem, literally! Creatively presented dishes did not compromise on quality and despite being a large group, each dish was exquisite. I will certainly come back to this place during regular hours and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their dining experience!","145":"Might be the best restaurant I've been to in Singapore in the last year. \u00c2\u00a0The quality was fantastic and breadth of options numerous. \u00c2\u00a0Considering Singapore prices, this was very reasonable given the quality. \u00c2\u00a0I highly recommend it!","146":"Good food. Feels chic in a backpacker way but is still expensive. Worth trying.","147":"Was so intrigued by the Makgeoli, had to come back a second time, but this time sans the coworker who only liked beer. Had the normal Makgeoli small bottle. It has a stronger kick of alcohol than normal. Was very tasty. Didn't try the standard Makgeoli out of their beer tap, the waitress mentioned it wasn't as strong and was lighter.I've tried the Army Stew, raboki, kimchee Prawn pasta, and bossam. All were good hits to the palate. Bossam - the pork was on the fatty side, but was nicely braised. The cabbage had a unique lemon flavor. The dikon kimchee had nicely grilled garlic that I enjoyed. Definitely a winner dish.Army Stew - spicy stew with sausage, noodles, green onions and other yummy ingredients. I'm used to seeing spam as well though it seemed to be missing. Good and tasty dish.Raboki - a traditional drinking accompaniment (anju). Tubes of rice cake with fishcake tempura in a spicy red sauce is the duk bokki \u00c2\u00a0and you add the Ramen noodles to make it a rraboki. Ramen + duk bokki = raboki. Kimchee Prawn Pasta - really enjoyed the Korean twist to the traditional Prawn pasta dish. Good Korean bar with tasty anju. Liked the Makgeoli theme and the place is pretty chill. Seems you need reservations to be seated on the 2nd floor.","148":"Was super excited to checked this place out but the was disappointed in the end. \u00c2\u00a0The truffle fries were decent, but the pork belly plate didn't do it for me at all. \u00c2\u00a0The pork was good, but the kimchi was way way way too sweet. \u00c2\u00a0It was almost like eating candied pork...I saw the party next to me munching on some wings and was kind of wishing that I ordered that instead... \u00c2\u00a0Since the food was just so so, it really kept me from ordering the makgeolli here.The atmosphere and interior setup was ok, though the overall size of the place was on the small side. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately, this was a one and done for me.","149":"I've been here twice, mainly for their yummy frozen makgeolli drinks. The food here is alright, but probably not my first pick for Korean food. There are many other Korean restaurants I would prefer although it's kind of hard to beat a location like this, with the right combination of finger foods and great drinks.They have more than a dozen (if my memory serves) types of makgeolli in all kinds of flavors - from passionfruit to strawberry. There's a sampler but you can also get them in jugs to share. One evening, we popped by before closing and managed to get a table in the packed restaurant. We were led to a table upstairs where it was much more quiet and thus great for having a chat over drinks. They had every flavor available so we chose yuzu and passionfruit.I would definitely recommend the passionfruit - it was sweet and sour, and full of fresh delicious flavor, and you could see all the little seeds in there so you know it's made with fresh passionfruit. The yuzu was a little on the subtle side, I think I'm used to that delicious fragrant kick you get from yuzu tea so I had high hopes that were slightly deflated. It was super refreshing regardless and a good crowd-pleaser.I took away one star for slow service and relatively boring food options. Quite nice for drinks though!","150":"i want nobody, nobody but joo!i want nobody, nobody but joo!nan dareun sarameun sirheo niga animyeon sirheo! \u00c2\u00a0 i want nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody!joo marries two of my favourite things from korea.makgeolli(fermented rice alcoholic beverage) and budae jjigae(army stew)!!!there is no shortage of korean restaurants in SG.tanjong pagar and chinatown are full of them.but joo has that little something special.a sexy, charismatic aura that draws me in.there are no rough edges here.everything is smooth and suave.from the decor to the staff.the food and beverage is thoughtfully created mostly from scratch and you can taste the quality.the simple banchan they served me, was simply polished off.they are not mere fillers but side dishes that whets your appetite and enhances the overall dining experience!from the sweet, spicy and sour radish, to the soft and creamy macaroni egg salad, to the crispy fried tiny fish, you can taste the love that goes into it!budae jjigae!what can i say!best eaten in the cold harsh winters of korea!a very humble army stew that comprises hot dog, spam and ham mixed with gochujang and kimchi plus instant ramen!they get the ratio just right here!the consistency, heat and spice will light up a winter's night!and it's a single serve portion, unlike many other places where you need to share with 2 or more people.makgeolli!since my seoul mate introduced me to this drink at a specialty makgeolli bar, i have never looked back.no soju, just makgeolli for me, please!just like i have a fetish for cloudy apple juice and cloudy sancerre, i have to have makgeolli!here it is home brewed, organic, made fresh daily, no aspartame.so expect the original version to be slightly sour instead of sweet.but they do have sweet versions with fruits, if that floats your boat.i would recommend the yucha slush makgeolli.you will hardly notice that you are drinking an alcoholic beverage.the baby eel paper, thin sheets of small eel pressed and deep fried are mas-issneun!best accompanied with alcohol!then there's their secret weapon!homemade thin cut crisps, always sliced and fried fresh daily!no overnighters allowed!so if you come late at night before closing and sit at the bar, they will all be yours to eat, for FREE!:)i want nobody, nobody but joo!i want nobody, nobody but joo!how can i be with another, i don't want any other!i want nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody!","151":"This is a quaint little modern Korean place. I popped by with a bibulous friend on a weeknight and had chicken wings, the makgeolli sampler, and regular makgeolli to wash everything down.Oh my. They have good wings here, and I'm not even a wings kinda gal. Juicy, crispy, with garlic bits on it, you will not regret ordering em here.I particularly enjoyed the makgeolli sampler, though I cannot for the life of me remember the flavors. If you have a girlfriend or a date, she will most certainly enjoy the sampler; doubles up as a dessert for someone with a sweet tooth!Did not try dinner items as we came here post-dinner.","152":"This newly-discovered place by me is my current go-to place to indulge in chill K tunes, drink makgeolli and dine on fusion Korean food that is oh-so-yummy.Verdict:- Makgeolli Sampler Set - Good to try this on your first visit to get a taste of the different flavoured Makgeolli. If you're a Makgeolli veteran, I suggest that you skip this. The portion is small \u00c2\u00a0(of course, it's just a sampler) but looks great for pics. There are 5 in the set - Original, Yuzu, Lychee, Peach and Strawberry and my personal preference is in the order listed.- Yuzu Makgeolli (large size) - Very refreshing and one of my favourites. The large size is good to share among 2 ladies.- Braised pork belly - Per serving comes with a few slices. Honestly, this dish had a chef recommended symbol on the menu but the pork slices were quite tough and chewy. Not something I would order again.- Home-made Tapioca chips - Yums! Goes great with \u00c2\u00a0Makgeolli with two dips given.- Gangnam Dreaming cocktail - Had a 7up initial taste but faded to a bittersweet berry aftertaste.- Insadong memories - One of the best cocktails I've tasted during my trips to Joo Bar. Refreshing, sweet and had a great cinnamon ginger taste. Double like!Been here 4 times within the past 2 months and will keep coming back for more mod Korean food!Tip: Sit near the bar if you're not here for dinner as it is pretty interesting chatting with the bespectacled bartender Eddy, and see how he mix the drinks for you. Also, you tend to get a bucket of FOC chips if you're sitting at the bar compared to ordering drinks at the usual table.","153":"You got a tree in your backyard growing money for you and you LOVE \u00c2\u00a0(Korean rice wine) as much as I do, this is your place.I laughed at the idea that they had \u00c2\u00a0in draft. \u00c2\u00a0But it was yum to the me. bo ssam was delicious and the use of citron is quite brilliant. \u00c2\u00a0Pork belly was delicious.Three stars for such an arrogant pricing and failing to win me over with portion.On a side note, where the hell are these young kids making money? \u00c2\u00a0Or are they just spending the hard-earned money so foolishly on some creative cocktail using makkuli??","154":"Very impressed on my first visit here. That dark interior with white washed walls gives Joo Bar a cozy and chill feel. The food would entice any korean food fans. I particularly like the Joo Bossam and the minced beef. Try the set of \u00c2\u00a0makegolli of 5 @ $35. Good for a gathering of friends on a weekday night.full review on my blog.","155":"We discovered this hidden place passing by. Quite close from Bugis MRT. The deco is very stylish, the menu is very unique has it is a Korean bar with unique food and drink specialities.","156":"The Enchanted cafe is situated in Little India. It's such a cute decor setting cafe - perfect to their name! I had made a Sunday brunch reservation through their FB page & so getting a seat was not a problem. The cafe is small but the decor & vibe will totally make you feel like In the sets of Harry Potter. The server was very sweet & friendly! This was my first visit & I wanted to try their famous Elixir drink- it was just perfect summer drink, very relaxing & the effects of dry ice gave it a real magical potion feel!! We loved the Creamy Carbonara & Choco-nana-tella toast. The food is presented very well & everything tasted so good!! The prices seemed fair & reasonable. The restaurant is going to relaunch after a week with new menu & look! Although I am sad that their Elixir drink won't be included.. I am excited to return to see the new look & try their new menu! This is definitely one of my fav cafes so far.. Can't wait to return.","157":"It's amazing that this cafe was around for a year and I have not been here! Probably it was over-shadowed by Old Hen next door? ;)Beautiful dried flowers surround the cafe and it looked as if you've indeed stepped into an enchanted forest. Not to worry, there's not too much green that it might be scary for those with sensitive noses, like me. The wooden chairs\/tables (though not all consistent in type) complemented the plants\/dried flowers very well. My favourite, was the wall of oddities right next to the main door - you wouldn't even know that they were selling wrapped novels from The Novel Encounter (see pictures).Anyway, we were partly enticed by the promotion that the cafe is having now, that's why we headed there - Order a burger and get a specialty coffee for $1(Promotion valid til 13 April!)Verdict:* Ngoh Hiang Burger (with extra side of scrambled eggs as recommended by the lady boss) - The patty was juicy but I felt it was a tad small (I love patties, so the bigger the better!). The cold potato salad was heavenly; not sure what spices or herbs they used but I love the herb-y taste. The buns themselves were not too big but were nicely crisp on the outside. Overall, quite a creative dish.* Truffle fries - This didn't make it to my Top 5 list but the truffle smell did last longer and tasted better then average. A good snack to order should you decide to sit for a while longer and chat.* Mocha - If you're a Mocha fan, you've got to try this. The balance of coffee, milk and chocolate is perfect! After sipping many a Mocha in Norway and Iceland, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the first cup of Mocha I tasted in Singapore seems to be on par with what I had there.* Latte - Another perfect cup.Also, the theme of flowers\/trees\/magic lives on in the washroom. Look in the mirror and you might find a very thought-provoking quote - kinda reminds me of Snow White.p.s I like my coffee not so milky or bitter so if you have similar taste as me, you might like my recommendations.","158":"A cute little cafe tucked around Little India..you will easily miss this place if you are not attentive..the interior decor is simply amazing and you will feel you are in a Harry Potter set..the name of the drinks are also very interesting - definitely try the Elixirs potion! We tried the creamy carbonara with mushroom and it was delicious. The choco nana tella toast with the caramelized banana was also pretty good..","159":"What an amazing hidden Italian gem restaurant in Boat Clarke. Upon our arrival on a cool evening around 6:00PM, we were greeted by the friendly staff to show us to our river view table. Bruschetta al Pomodoro - simple and delicious.Pasta - clams with pasta you can't go wrong with seafood in white wine. I couldn't get enough Pizza - the pizza amazing, the sauce is fresh along with the prosciutto which equal to epic pizza. Tip: You need to make reservation to seat near the River view tables.","160":"I wasn't expecting much with the risotto but it had amazing truffle flavor; really nice change in the middle of all the Asian fare available here. \u00c2\u00a0Great views too.","161":"Out of their mind great prices for food. I could barely finish my delish complete dinner. The CNY specials last until the 9thPlenty of seating and plenty of choices * happened upon the durian stand and got some durian kaya ! Now that is oh so unique---Love the eating and alllllll of the walking and getting lost. Shopping here is like a huge labyrinth and one has to figure how it all works and connects!!","162":"Come here hungry! \u00c2\u00a0There are so many good here to eat including those delicious $$$ green and purple grapes from Japan! \u00c2\u00a0So many things to see and checkout on the weekends - many Japanese products and sushi. \u00c2\u00a0I even bought a pig placenta serum from Japan $60. \u00c2\u00a0The grocery store is insane and has a serious amount of cheap and tasty sushi. \u00c2\u00a0We spent the afternoon here and Orchard Road. \u00c2\u00a0So fun and easy to grab a Grab car. \u00c2\u00a0I'd highly recommend eating and shopping here, especially when it's during the rain!","163":"The stalls have generic names (like 'Chicken Rice', 'Prawn Noodles', 'Yong Tau Foo', 'Cutlet Speciality', 'Fried Carrot Cake', 'Korean Cuisine', etc), so that stall holders can be replaced without much drama. This also means they cannot induce brand name hawker stalls to come - a strategy adopted by Food Republic at its 3 food courts (ION Orchard, Wisma Atria, and Isetan). No wonder the quality of the food is at least one notch below the others. - the food at the 'Indian Cuisine' stall is downright horrific, and choice limited; avoid it! On top of that, seating place is more limited, AND must be shared with brands that are not in the food court (SaladStop, ToriQ), whereas these brands do have their own seats and tables at Tangs and ION, respectively. But, given the prime position of Takashimaya, at meal times this is always packed solid; more than once I have seen customers fights over seats. Along with the Lucky Plaza food court(s), this is probably the worst on Orchard Road, although the Far East malls are positioned to be more downmarket, so that is less of a surprise.","164":"This place is fantastic. Granted, I am partial towards Japanese food which you will find lots of here. Prices are reasonable and the quality top notch. The vendors happily provide samples. You will find Japanese items with a Singapore spin, like Dorayaki filled with durian. I am a sweets lover so my brain nearly exploded from all the bakeries, waffles and even mini doughnuts. High quality Japanese rice is sold as well as seafood items and dim sum.","165":"Like all Japanese department stores there's always a food court serving up great goodies. That's true here too. Mouth drooling especially on an empty stomach as my sister and I were. \u00c2\u00a0We settled on this stall listing steamed buns but noticed folks queued up for something only listed in Chinese. \u00c2\u00a0We can't read Chinese characters so we asked what was it. \u00c2\u00a0Steamed little rice cakes. \u00c2\u00a0Then topped with minced dried turnip. \u00c2\u00a0So we went with that. \u00c2\u00a0 Yummy. \u00c2\u00a0At another stall, it was all deep fried offerings. \u00c2\u00a0Anything deep fried is a good thing. \u00c2\u00a0I got the curry puff and the durian. \u00c2\u00a0Yummy again.Not a whole lot of seating but we took our goodies to go.","166":"I love Tokyo Takashimaya because it has great food court in the basement.Singapore Takashimaya food court is not as great as Tokyo Takashimaya but it's still good.YakisobaTakoyakiYakitoriMochiRice crackers Mmmmm now I am hungry...","167":"This is one big and busy food court in Singapore malls, and is one of the best that I have seen here in Singapore. It gets real busy during meal hours - finding a place to sit can be a challenge. The good has many options to try, ranging from Chinese, to Japanese, to even Italian and French.","168":"Very touristy, with similar prices to match. Suffice to say, one is more likely to find tourists here than local Singaporeans. Overall a very crowded food court and it gets tricky to find a seat during lunchtime on any given day. The food here is well portioned and very delicious. Go for the nasi padang at the corner or try out the char siew noodle stall, both of which are my favourites.","169":"Actually not so much this food court but the surrounding kiosks in this food area basement. I find it's really nice food. The food court itself is better quality imo than other food courts. It's a notch above your typical food republic.","170":"I was a little disappointed in the food court here. There was plenty of variety of food, but I guess we ended up trying the wrong stalls. I got an iced Vietnamese coffee from Pho Hoa (okay, I probably shouldn't have gone there considering we have that in the US too), but the coffee was watered down and not good. We also tried some takoyaki balls from another stall, way too oily\/soggy and not much flavor. The dessert shop was out of this mango dessert they seemed to specialize in, and we got some onigiri from a Japanese stall that was decent, but on the more expensive side. And on top of all that, we couldn't even find an open table for the two of us to sit at. I think next time, I'll have to try one of the night markets instead.","171":"Not from Singapore but been in love with this place everytime I come and visit Singapore since I was a child. The stalls has not changed at all, some of the dishes that were offered 10 years ago are still around. My regular round would be the roast duck noodle. Followed with takoyaki from Tako Pachi. Yum! It's just finding tables can be a little annoying. Be aggressive in order to feast in peace.","172":"I love the hustle and bustle of this place and the wide variety of international foods you get to eat in close proximity of each other. From specialty swiss and belgian chocolatiers, to german cake shops to japanese bakeries to artisan teas and coffees...the list goes on. It has this vibrant, marketplace vibe that goes on as people wander from stall to stall, tasting samples, browsing prettily packaged foods. It can get a little too crowded on weekends and that makes it pretty frustrating to get around as the aisle are pretty narrow. Weekdays tend to be emptier and you can take your time to walk around and browse without worrying about blocking someone's way.One may argue that it has become a tad bit touristy and can be a little overpriced, but I suppose that's the price you pay for specialty imported foods.","173":"Good food at a very reasonable price what more can you ask for.It can get quite congested and finding a seat can be a challenge but if you can get past that then the end result will be sumptuous.There is a lot of variety there from Singaporean Chicken Rice to Chinese to Desert and the reasonable does not sacrifice quality so definitely try it out if you can.","174":"Loved the ambience & service staff ! They asked if I've any food preference & allergies - very attentive ! We had the $98++ omakase dinner and we had a wonderful dining experience with the cocktails concocted for us . Definitely will look forward to go back again !","175":"All the drinks are pricey...even with the HH list (attached) of $18 drinks. What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the \"heart\" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story \"hidden\" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is.","176":"Very nice cafe\/coffee shop during the day. Its small, so you might need to wait for a table. Once seated you order at the counter. Food was tasty and portions were generous, with sufficient options for vegetarians. I loved the avocado on toast topped with cherry tomatoes. The scrambled eggs were a little too soft for me taste, but I'm extremely picky about that. The flavour\/seasoning was great. Coffee was a touch sour but still decent. The cakes all looked amazing. Egg dishes were about $14-$16\/each. It seemed reasonable by Singapore standards.","177":"Excellent service. Been wanting to try this place for sometime. The Lobster udon and lobster linguine were very good. The chicken sliders and salmon don were good. The bespoke cocktail was freshly made. Only thing was the place was a bit cramped.","178":"As far as surprise dinners go, this was a success. The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of \"room\", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, \"divided\" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the \"Shakespeare in the Park\"-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally \"mixing it up\" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!","179":"Dude I've been here two times in the past month. I tried the signature 6 course menu on my first visit and it did not disappoint. Creative dishes and also paired with 6 different cocktails. Also, as it was a Friday during lent, the chef was gracious enough to substitute a veggie dish for my main course since I was not eating meat.Second time around, I went for the Omakase menu...peep the pictures...its 13 courses for under $70...is there a better deal?Just relax and enjoy, the chef even came over to talk to us about what he prepared. Nice touch.Location is awesome, cool points for date nights or to impress people from out of town....I'm coming back as I have a queue of visitors coming through. Bartenders also excellent and super nice. I heart this place.","180":"Fort by Maison Ikkoku, located at the serene and idyllic Fort Canning Hill, is a new cocktail bar and fusion dining concept helmed by Executive Chef and Head Mixologist, Ethan Leslie Leong. The creative team applied different styles and techniques of cocktail mixing such as distillation, infusion, spherification, dehydration, emulsion and smoking to bring you chemical transformation of ingredients and the best of molecular gastronomy to elevate your dining experience.The 3 signature mainstays available in their ala-carte menu are The Sea, The Nest and The Fort. All in all, the synergy of the gourmet dishes with ingenious cocktail pairings brings me on a gastronomical journey fit for an epicure, in a truly magical setting no less.","181":"*Overdue review from my last trip*I came here on a Saturday morning with my sisters for breakfast. So many cafes have popped up in Singapore that I'm skeptical half the time. But this one really delivered. I enjoyed the piccolo latte and french toast with caramelized bananas. Place has a nice laid back vibe and isn't way too crowded on a Saturday morning when we went there.","182":"When I received my bespoke cocktail, I just... stopped. And stared. And stared some more. It was just *that* pretty. And then I wasn't sure I could drink it, because what a waste that would be.So, yes. Maison Ikkoku. They make pretty damn good cocktails (both literally pretty as well as the figuratively). I was really happy with my tweaked old-fashioned as well as kiwi .... something. I call it bellissima.Staff are really friendly and knowledgeable, atmosphere is really nice and this is a great place to chill out with your date and people watch.","183":"Came to the bar about 9pm on a Wednesday night for a nightcap. Another mixologist bar, where the men take pride in their dressing and drinks.Nothing spectacular, a safe bet in terms of cocktails, where the mixologists mix according to what you feel like. I asked for something fruity and with a thick layer of egg white foam. Yum! I got a Fabulous Diana V, and my companion got a French Maid, which is essentially coffee and alcohol.I wouldn't say this place is stunning, but it's quite cosy and nice. I would still rather go to the Horse's Mouth instead.","184":"The espresso is really good at this place. The cakes although HUGE and pic worthy is just average imo. They are 3 people size so you'll struggle even with 2 people. I dunno. I know that cake is a simple dessert but I rather have a smaller dessert that wows me(lady m). When it comes to dessert maybe it is the motion of the ocean rather than the size of the..4 star on the espresso though. Yumz","185":"Double espresso is average to slightly above imo of course. There is a better place. But but( \u00c2\u00a0Y \u00c2\u00a0) the venue and surrounding area is charming so that's a plus. I wouldn't come back unless I was taking guests to sight see tbh. Wifi measuring at 6.53 Mbps.","186":"It's hip, because there are naked light bulbs hanging from the central bar. It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word \"omakase\"), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's \u00c2\u00a0some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned.","187":"Had a great coffee in here, Liz was managing and can really work the very state of the art expresso machine. Great atmosphere and very engaged friendly staff. As it was slow I got many kind tips about the neighborhood. This is a brilliant business model, be kind when you can, clients will return to that.","188":"I have only been here for brunch and coffee and cake on weekends.Love the brunchy egg dishes and coffee. The cake we had was decent but not something to rave about. Coffee is really good, smooth. It is always crowded on weekends and with that came the noise which is loud enough to give you a headache. Service is average to non-existent, especially when everyone is rushing around when it is full house. Probably a 3.5 stars place. 4 stars for the food and coffee.3 stars for the service and ambience","189":"Yes our favorite brunch co. now has a cool and classy restaurant-bar sister at Pinacotheque De Paris on Fort Canning Hill. The menu sees a line up of bespoke cocktails alongside pretty plates of mod Japanese food, and the entire concept is developed by the familiar Ethan Leslie Leong, who is both the Executive Chef and Master MixologistMuch thought has gone into the cocktail pairing multi-sensory dining experience at FORT by MI. Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and \u00c2\u00a0Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)\/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Cr\u00c3\u00a8me Br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68\/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves! Bespoke cocktails are priced at $18, and infusion shots at $10.","190":"Weekends are for brunches and i finally checked out Maison Ikkoku's brunch offerings! I don't know why i took so long to visit but anyway i'm glad i finally did because it was purrrrrfect. Nothing makes me happier than brunch with perfectly done eggs, a strong and aromatic cuppa and of course great company. What sets Maison Ikkoku apart from the regular coffee shop is that it sells a lifestyle and not just a product. Think of it as a one stop shop for the chill out weekend; Maison Ikkoku is branded as a lifestyle boutique combining mid-high end international menswear retail, a caf\u00c3\u00a9 centered on quality coffee and the perfect semi-alfresco cocktail bar.I was too occupied with brunch to check out the other levels but anyway.. Great Iced Mocha that wasn't too sweet. Bittersweet and intense melted chocolate was used with the strong coffee that had my head and tummy singing. Girls being girls, we each ordered a different dish so that we could try as many dishes as possible. The adventurous Y went for the Spicy Beef Rendang Fusion sandwich. Not my typical choice for brunch (i'm boring that way) but this was a surprisingly fiery and exciting option that i would consider in the future. It's easy on the coconut so you can taste the well flavored rempah but it's pretty spicy.I struggled with my brunch choice and in the end i went for the Croque Madame instead of the Eggs Benedict. Great flavors from the honey glazed ham, gruyere and home-made b\u00c3\u00a9chamel but it just seemed a little dry with the toasted pain de campagne.The benedict\/florentine really takes the cake here at Maison Ikkoku. Full bodied and well balanced Hollandaise sauce is so hard to come by and this was da bomb. Loved the texture, loved the flavors, loved the overall moisture of every bite. The savory spinach in the Salmon Florentine gave the dish an interesting twist and made me crave for more. While the brunch items were great, the desserts were meh. We had the Blueberry Cheesecake which was very light. I liked the graham crust but found it too crumbly! The blueberry sauce was a tad too sweet and require some tartness to balance it out. The Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake was really dense a la brownie texture but it tasted empty. I really wouldn't wanna be wasting my calories on this one.Maison Ikkoku is definitely on my favorites list. Enjoy!","191":"I've heard plenty from my friends who have been here and they raved so much about the coffee, atmosphere and food that I simply had to try it sooner (rather then later).Although it was a Saturday evening at around 715pm, there wasn't much crowd. We nabbed a cozy spot next to the door, with sofas and our back to the wall panelling. It was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door. My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection\/names didn't catch my attention.The staff\/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet\/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe.","192":"Cafe changed management on 1st July 2017. They are no longer doing brew coffee. Too bad as I've been coming here for the brews. Time to explore others. All the best to the new mgt anyway.","193":"Set in a trendy area of Singapore this place is also clearly mainly aimed at the hipsters. Perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of Maison Ikkoku seems to still remain. They do coffee, cocktails and food. The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table. If they would up the service a little bit I would change the rating to a four without a doubt.","194":"This place would have received a 4-5 star review except the bar was so RUDE. Charging me a $25 drink and forcing me to pay $10 tip for a \"bar trick\"??? F...you! Chris A., who came to visit me from L.A., and I were catching up when a bartender interrupted my conversation and asked if we wanted to see a trick. Of course, we reluctantly said agreed. She then asked for a $10, put the bill in between two beer bottles and asked us to remove it without tipping the bottles over, or she'll place the $10 bill in the tip jar. W...T...F.....Would I come back again? I do enjoy the drinks..but forcing me to \"tip\"? Ha!","195":"This WAS my favorite cocktail bar. However, on my last two most recent visits, the cocktails are just not up to par. They are awesome if Ethan himself is mixing them. But when left to the other mixologists, the drinks just do not step up.Still love the space and the concept, just don't believe in paying their pricing for the quality of the drinks that I am getting. The search continues for the next perfectly balanced cocktail in that elusive bar in Singapore.","196":"Currently my favorite cocktail bar.The space is adorable and not overly busy. So you can still carry on a decent conversation with your friends and the mixologist.What we like about this place is the drinks are well made. In the midst of the many bespoke cocktail bars these days, ikkoku does a great job. The drinks are made with fresh fruits and herbs, and not overly sweet like most places while still packing the punch. And most importantly, well-balanced.The drinks we had:- lemongrass grape cocktail- blackberry whiskey sour- bloody good Mary (their version packs an awesome spicy punch, not for the faint hearted)- earl grey gin- cucumber basil martiniThey only have 4 bar snacks: smoked duck, Hokkaido scallops, pizza and edamame. The scallops is way too sour as \u00c2\u00a0only the vinaigrette is left after torching the alcohol. The smoked duck is....awesome. A perfect bar snack that is salty and savory. They torched it before serving and you get the charred crispy skin. So good that we ordered two portions.","197":"This cafe is one of the better brunch places I have been to in Singapore. The food served is really good and the coffee... oh man that is just the finishing touch on a good brunch. I had the Smoked Salmon Scrambled and the portion was huge enough for 2 to share (well we wanted to share cause we needed to save space for the desserts). The scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that I am going for that combination from here on. The multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat, which was lovely. The guacamole is too awesome for words. I'm not a fan of guacamole but boy did I wipe out all of it this time around.I had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant. The last time I remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at Bowery Street, New York. Desserts is a must. This time around, we went for the rainbow cake (last slice btw!) and it was so good. Not too sweet that it turns you off. It seemed like a mix between a carrot cake and a cheese cake. This place is really good and a must go!","198":"We got to Maison Ikkoku around noon on a Sunday, evidently peak brunch time as the (tiny) cafe was already packed. However, we were quite lucky - there's still a table for two that's only reserved for 1pm. Since we weren't planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there, we promised we would be in and out before then.I immediately zero-ed in on the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($18), mainly for the chunky guac side, while my sister got Croque Madame ($15)I was pleasantly surprised by the portion. The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi? Yum! I enjoyed the seasoned rice and it's pretty cheap for the size. I think it's pretty hard to mess this one up anyway.","199":"Small place tucked in at the end of Kandahar Street. Chanced upon it while walking around and then read good reviews online. Nice place, \u00c2\u00a0nice service. You have to order yourself at the counter- which is not \u00c2\u00a0a stretch at all. \u00c2\u00a0The salted French toasts were amazing. The orange juice was great too- freshly squeezed but somehow when I saw it had froth around it- almost looking like a mango shake. Would I go again- yes I would. Especially is one is in the Arab Street area. There is no other place which is a worthy competition for MI - \u00c2\u00a0except maybe The Hangar but then it is overcrowded and one is always under the feeling that one should leave soon.","200":"Haven't been here in a long time so when I came by today, it felt like I was coming home. I used to be here almost 5-6 times a week so it's nice to see some familiar faces still running this joint. The MI Latte is a big dollop of wonderful. Besides the good food, the coffee here is exceptional. The staff do their best and it's situated in a wonderful area in Singapore, full of culture and atmosphere. Right across the cafe is the Malay Heritage Centre which has a sprawling garden serenely situated within this district. Taking a stroll within the compound after your coffee break at Maison Ikkoku is as simple as walking across. Worth coming here during a lazy afternoon. Just note that weekends are extremely crowded during brunch time and most seats are usually taken up---they take reservations as well but call early!Oh, my recommendation: try their own in-store-crafted Tiramisu cake --- it's delectable and delightful!","201":"Loved this place!! The brunch was one of the best I've had and the eggs were absolute perfection. We also ordered the French toast which was a nice sweet treat. We came early on a Saturday morning. Most tables were reserved however we were able to find a spare one easily. The service was quick and the food beyond delicious. Very happy with the prices.","202":"The coffee tho. I've been heading to MI for at least 4 years now, and it's never disappointed. Heck, I've brought at least 7 to 8 different groups of friends, and they've all loved it as much. Although I have to add, the quality of coffee you get at MI differs according to the barista making it.Plus: The food used to be terrific and extremely value-for-money. Sadly, in recent months\/years, standards seem to have taken a hit, and prices have only inflated. Tip: if you're driving, don't scrimp on a parking coupon. The parking wardens are relentless around this area.","203":"Great coffee place, trendy, in Malay Kampong Glam area. Good sandwiches - innovative combinations - and cakes. Relatively expensive; 2 sandwiches, 2 capuccinos and 2 fresh orange juices will set you back about SGD50, but very good quality. Will definitely return; on my short list now for breakfast\/brunch\/lunch in SG!","204":"I went here for the Valentine's day special which was a 12 course meal. Everything was wrong. My girlfriend and I arrived at 8:25pm for an 8:30 reservation. We were told immediately that they needed 15 min to clean and prepare for us. 45 minutes later we were seated. It took 20 minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited. The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2. The place was packed and the seating was minimal. They were obviously overbooked and unprepared. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. The drink I received from the mixologist was the only bright spot.","205":"Seems like there was a change of management. Same old place, different standards of coffee, sub-par on some days, real bad on others. Inconsistent.Music selection - seems like classic rock and boybands are put on strict rotation. * cringe * On the topic of music, why am I made to feel like I need to shout in here to have a decent conversation with friends. Just decide if you want to be a speciality coffee shop or an ah beng KTV already. Bad music on full blast, every single time. We have had to tell the staff to tone it down, but most of the time, they seem too preoccupied with singing along and clowning around with their posse to even care about service.What happened to the good ol' days Maison??? You've managed to turn a good thing bad, congratulations. For a while, we were on the fence, but I think we can safely write you off now.R.I.P","206":"This intimate spot is proud of its cocktails, and for good reason. \u00c2\u00a0Expect a consistently tasty drink and spectacular presentation.","207":"This place has a really laid-back, indie vibe. Slightly off the beaten track, with warm orange lighting and chilled-out tunes in the background, it calls for a nice lazy afternoon with a cup of well-brewed coffee...and maybe some cake if i had my way.I tried their Pumpkin Cheesecake and was pretty impressed on my first taste of it. I could taste the pumpkin though the cheese and the nutty crust. Brilliant! It was however a little too heavy for me towards the end. Well, that's partially my fault for being too greedy anyway. Their coffee was pretty good! Smooth and velvety, just what I needed for a rainy afternoon. I went up to the roof top bar to have a look but it was closed in the day. Perhaps this place beckons for another visit at night.","208":"This place is definitely one of the cafes in Singapore that I loved! They had a good brunch menu and also had free WiFi! I love Arab street and haji lane and hence its location was perfect for me to spend tea time here and head out to dinner afterwards at one of the Muslim places in Arab street. It's perfect if you want to meet a friend to catch up of tea\/coffee.","209":"What I love: As much as this place has 3 levels - the Cafe, the store and the bar on the 3rd\/rooftop, I'm only gonna comment on the Bar as that's the place I LOVE LOVE LOVE to the core. It's quite the climb - but it's worth it. Once you get up, the view is amazing - of the beautiful Sultan Mosque, with the glittering gold domes, and with a few drinks, you almost feel like you're not in Singapore anymore - I almost feel like I'm Istanbul, looking out. The ambiance is chic, the tables outside on the deck are my fave, but the ones inside are nice if you want air-conditioning.MUST HAVES: The Smoked Goose. OMG. I can't even describe this. The drinks are amazing. I think they have a menu - but I always just tell the waiter what I feel like having, \"Something not too sweet, refreshing and strong\", and they'll whip up something for you. Makes it kinda exciting.Their drinks are visually orgasmic - with very elaborate designs, and very artistic interpretations of the traditional cocktail.I had like 8-10 drinks there last Friday, and had a blast. Go with friends and enjoy the hipster-chic-Arab Street.What I don't love: Drink are $22-$25 a pop - so, errr, yeah.","210":"I used to love coming to this place because the coffee and food was good but had the most horrible experience today. I went there to buy coffee with a friend as usual. My friend had commented that her loyalty card had disappeared once new management took over and the girl was very defensive and unapologetic, then turned to me and basically said - \"you don't want coffee right? that's fine you can go\". I was struck by how dismissive, unfriendly, unapologetic, and rude she was and can not believe her attitude towards the customers. Of course I did not order any coffee after that and will not be coming back again unless something changes. Extremely disappointed.","211":"My friend and I literally stumbled across this lovely place yesterday and boy, it was such a gem! \u00c2\u00a0Amazing bartender Matteo was so attentive with incredible craft cocktails and beautiful prosecco. \u00c2\u00a0We weren't intending to stay long, but the food, booze and great company kept us all night. \u00c2\u00a0We had a fresh Irish oysters to start and insanely great maguey carpaccio \u00c2\u00a0with out-of-world virgin olive oils and sea salt. \u00c2\u00a0The dish called 'Nest' was delish as well with an interesting twist of chawanmushi with mozzarella cheese. \u00c2\u00a0Love, love, loved it! \u00c2\u00a0 I can't wait for my next visit!!!","212":"Ikkoku definitely has national-best-worthy potential along all the dimensions it offers - coffee, food, cocktails. Enough skill to be worthy of 5*. I'm docking one for high prices and their inability to keep up service quality when the place is full. And somewhat because the location is annoying to get to, as well as being quite nice. None of these (except lack of scalability) is worthy of a star by itself but they add up.The coffee is very, very good. In fact I used to trek there to get my beans because they get the roast amongst the most \"right\" of all the roasters in Singapore. It's a light roast of single origins with very nutty tones (think Colombian) which is perfect for long drinks. Price is in line with hipster coffee places at 7 for a cold drip.The food is best defined as quality tiny portions at exorbitant prices. 18++ for a bit of cheese and 6 crackers is ridiculous! But it's a hip place, the customer base is probably trying to keep under their calorie limits... I try to eat before going there even though it's pretty good stuff. The cocktails are precise and well balanced. What I wonder is how much of that is bartender skill and how much is recipes and good quality control? Nothing wrong with the latter but the prices seem to be marked up to levels implying the former. If Ah Sam can offer bespoke cocktails AND chuck 3 attempts down the drain before offering you something they're happy with, for only 23++, the more than 30 charged by Ikkoku is a bit ridiculous. It's also worth noting that you take a risk by letting them go wild, occasionally you get a dud (our berry mojito was not that different from a dragonfruit flavour vitaminwater) - but that's part of the game. No risk no gain. I do wonder what the ice is made of. The smell of the water from the melting ice definitely reminded me of MacRitchie reservoir. Again, at that price point I'd expect using something other than tap water in delicately balanced cocktails (or at least filter it). What annoyed me is that I once asked for a variation on a classic cocktail (instead of sticking with giving them a mood and getting something \"created\") and they made a bit of a fuss about it, implying I didn't trust them or something. On the contrary, a true artist works best within constraints (cf what Helmut Newton's \"victims\" said of sessions with him, which were dictatorial). A classic sour, for example, is all about balancing the sour, sweet and booze taste-wise and texturally, the egg white (which they did impeccably). A sazerac is the hardest of all as too much absinthe results in basically an aniseed short drink, and too little and you have something resembling an Old Fashioned. The location is alright, sandwiched between shophouses and with a magnificent view from the garden over the Sultan Mosque which has just been renovated. Bit far from public transport by foot.On a normal (i.e. not full) day, the prices are somewhat justified by the competent and personalized service and peaceful interior. Then we made the mistake of coming on the Chillax anniversary night where something like 500 Amex card holders poured onto a small number of bars to test the resilience and scalability of the teams on duty that night. Once we got there and somehow secured a table, the team cranked up the music to painful levels (to stop people lingering and clear space for more of the mobs?) so much so that we on outside tables kept closing the door to try and preserve our eardrums. It then took them 10 minutes to take our order and around 1h10 to deliver the cocktails. This is the downside of hand crafting every order, scalability is almost impossible. We moved on to Auld Alliance which had no issue with the Chillax crowds, thanks to having both ample amounts of staff at hand and serving whisky instead of cocktails, which take less effort to serve. If Chillax had been my only experience of Ikkoku, I'd never come back.The thing is, at this price point, I don't bother going to Ikkoku anymore anyway. Sure it's good, but the stack of small risks and issues just make it hard to find the willpower to make the effort, particularly if the night will be crowded. There's plenty of competition in town...","213":"Very delicious 7 buck cup of mocha. \u00c2\u00a0I didn't eat anything here. \u00c2\u00a0Just sat alone with my hot cup of mocha...surrounded by couples and groups of friends chatting about weekend plans and other activities.Yep...just me and my 7 dollar cup of coffee. \u00c2\u00a0It was good...but maybe I'll drag The Princess here with me next time...but she's only 5 years old and probably shouldn't drink coffee.","214":"I was here on a Saturday morning for brunch in the cafe downstairs. What struck me about the place at first was the decor. Beautifully simple. It was furnished with eclectic pieces of furniture. I settled down, ordered the \"Break of Dawn\" and a latte. The orders came quick, served with a smile. I would have to say the fare is simple but delicious. Helpings are okay. I would definitely come by again and check out the bar that exists on the 3rd floor.","215":"All I had in mind yesterday afternoon was spam musubi--spam topping a log of Japanese short-grained rice mixed with furikake. A lovely mix of texture and flavour. I really appreciated how they offered to warm it up as I was having it to go--musubi + latte = perfect pre-dinner snack.I will be back--there was a orh nee (yam paste) cheesecake sitting in the refrigerated case calling my name!","216":"Seinen manga nerds, you've come to the wrong spot... unless of course you're looking for delicious coffee, fast, free internet and a delicious hot brekkie. (Think: sea salt caramel french toast with cinnamon and sour cream.) In which case, you couldn't have picked a better place. Welcome in. Maison Ikkoku is somewhere I come on each visit to Singapore - whether it be for the downstairs cafe with their gorgeous coffee or the upstairs rooftop bar with one of my favourite views in the city. I've even picked up a beautiful tie for my other half in the swanky and uber sartorial men's boutique in between. You'll definitely pay a bit more than you might be used to, but with food this fresh and cocktails that are equally delicious, you'll likely be more willing to dish out.","217":"This spot is houses a cafe on its first level, an apparel store on its second and a cocktail on its third. This is a great place for a cozy meet-up or appointments, without formalities. It serves pretty good coffee that will work well with most palettes. You can try most of the popular beans you will probably need to try at this spot. If you are down on a hot day, I will recommend their cold drip or iced long black (skip the syrup please!) They have really good desserts to accompany the coffee so you may like to leave some space for your sweet tooth when you're down.A winner on their menu is their MI Spam Misubi which is a dish brought forward by one of the co-owner days in Haiwaii. It is really addictive sushi made up of long-grain rice and a piece of spam (luncheon meat) on top.I love their apparel store as it features male clothes from Japan, London etc. Very edgy range with a nice attention to details.","218":"I can't comment on the food here as this isn't what I dropped in for - it was the extensive coffee menu that caught my attention. On a steamy hot Singapore day, a big cold glass of cold drip went down a treat. They have a wide range of brew method options (V60, Syphon etc) and some pretty impressive looking cakes in the cabinet. Some of the tables were marked reserved and it appears to get quite busy during brunch period, so if you're after a meal it might pay to call ahead.","219":"Great coffee, good food, very good cocktails in the evenings. Free wifi. What's there not to like? I love that the place is named for a fictional boarding house in a manga series, and that somebody thought it was a good idea to combine a coffee shop, boutique and rooftop cocktail bar (it really, really is).","220":"Maison Ikkoku is a chic little concept store made up of cafe (level 1), shop (level 2) and mixology bar (level 3) and unfortunately for the ladies, dedicated solely to chic men's wear. But don't despair - you can rock the androgynous look or covet the cool bags, or live vicariously by shopping for your partners here. It's mostly designer wear from USA and Japan, so it's a bit pricier. I didn't have time to visit the cafe or bar on the first and third levels, but it does sound like somewhere I want to go back to again!","221":"I love everything about Maison Ikkoku, which is also part of a concept store on the 2nd floor, and a bar on the 3rd! They have a great ambience and your tables are made out of old recycled doors or cupboard doors. Old shelves are also nailed to the celing, giving a vey odd impression that they are falling through the ceiling somehow!The coffee here is fantastic. I always order the latte, or the MI Signature latte. They use a fragrant blend of beans that I can enjoy without sugar. For those who aren't crazy about coffee, you can also order the chai tea, which I find good, but a little too sweet for my palate.The cakes here are also worth mentioning. My favourites were the pumpkin cheese cake, which was light and not too heavy, and the red velvet cake topped with cream cheese icing, walnuts and comes in a gloriously large slice.They have great sandwiches here at affordable rates. I found them so big, a friend and I could share one. They use good, freshly baked bread, and quality ingredients for their sandwiches.I've also tried the eggs benedict on their weekend brunch menu, and enjoyed it. I will definitely head back to try their other coffees and dishes!It's mostly street parking around here, so good luck at peak hours! This area is also notorious for the summons people loitering about and giving tickets, so it's best not to risk an illegal park. There is also a wait list for tables sometimes, especially on weekends, but I've not had to wait for more than 15 minutes before.","222":"Maison Ikkoku is the only place in Singapore where I will order espresso based coffee. After weeks of hunting around the city for a decent espresso based coffee, I mostly gave up. The stuff you get from Starbucks, Coffee Connoisseur, Tea Leaf & Bean and similar is junk. Usually watery, tepid, and bitter. Mostly, I got comfortable with the kopi houses all over singapore for my caffeine fix. It's a very different kind of drink, but once you get used to it, I found it to be a better option than the other coffee available.Anyway, back to Maison Ikkuku. This is the place I visit on the weekend, when I want to have a real coffee. Fresh ground beans, well roasted, and made properly with a decent espresso machine operated by people that know what they're doing. Best coffee I've had in Singapore. I gave it 4 stars, because even though it's the best, it's not comparable to what's available in Melbourne.","223":"Passed by this morning and remembered the good reviews I read on Yelp and decided to give it a try. \u00c2\u00a0I got the Flat White to go since I was in a hurry. \u00c2\u00a0It's a little pricey (S$5) considering I can get a good kopi generally for S$2... But the coffee was good. \u00c2\u00a0Also like their outdoor tables (made from a recycled door!)","224":"This caf\u00c3\u00a9 takes coffee very seriously, they even have diagrams and descriptions of how each cup is made. The fit out is very cool, and very 'New York'. The furniture fixed to the ceiling was a bit unsettling at first, but you get used to it. I appreciated the few salad options on the menu, as I hear that it's not always that easy to find salad in Singapore. Overall this is a very cool little place to hang out.","225":"I'm a fan. A fan of the bar. Not the coffee. The bar is definitely a must try. The bartenders are very well-versed with their flavors\/ingredients. I enjoy telling them one or two key ingredients or taste, let them mix a cocktail, and be surprised. Of course, you can always try their more popular drinks. The bloody mary is one of the best in town. So are the smoked whiskey & chili drinks. The service is great. Everyone is cheerful and friendly. The vibe is uplifting, cosy for a group of friends to hang out or catch up. My only pet peeve is no reservations after 9.30pm but I do understand their point of view. I hope for better seating arrangements. Nevertheless, keep up the great work and have more new produce\/ingredients!","226":"As I just passed Arab street, I wanted a coffee and checked on Yelp for suggestions. Maison Ikkoku caught my eye because of the cosy and chilled atmosphere.However, I thought that the service was pretty unfriendly. They were all chatting with each other and it felt like I was bothering them with my questions regarding the menu.And since I am sensitive to the service, it didn't make me want to stay. I ordered an iced Americano to go, which wasn't exceptional.Alright, maybe I'll give it another shot.","227":"Didn't really get to try their brunch because I missed the timings. The place is a little small and wasn't able to enjoy myself there because there was a constant crowd that adds pressure to make you leave instead of chilling and just hanging out with your friends there. \u00c2\u00a0Staff are generally quite friendly though (: choice of timing to visit quite crucial I feel.","228":"We came here for brunch on the weekend (had a 1pm reservation for 4)...it was crowded and a bit cramped, especially since we were sitting at the table by the door. There's a bit of self-service...you have to go to the counter to order and pour your own water, but they do bring you your food and are pretty attentive about taking finished plates away since there was barely enough space on the table (made from recycling old doors). My husband and I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled (mainly for the guacamole that came with it) and the French toast with caramelized bananas. Both were good...not to die for but definitely good. For the first time in Singapore, I had a version of spam musubi with REAL SPAM...at $3, it was a bit overpriced for its small size, but it satisfied my craving (the few places that sold musubi used generic spam). My caramel latte was much better than I expected...not too sweet but the coffee was strong and flavorful -- definitely not your average brucnh latte. Our friends ordered a side of potatoes and it was a lot smaller than we expected -- it came in the same sauce-like container the guacamole came in...it made the musubi for $3 look like a good deal haha. Two of us ordered the specialty coffee drinks and although they were good, they weren't as unique tasting as my latte.Overall, this place is cute (including the street it's on) and the food won't disappoint.","229":"Went on a Friday night and had an ok time. Service was very good I must say that..but my cocktails were again strictly ok. I had 4 in total with a rum base and finished with a white wine base..nothing tasted any different from what I have had before and for 28 dollars a cocktail I was not impressed. Though I must say a friends of mine who just told the bartender to surprise her did get good cocktails. Maybe I'll use that phrase next time","230":"Coming here for 4 days straight this week.. but their coffee tastes a bit sour. I don't know if they change their coffee beans recently or they just hire a new barista (who isn't experienced enough to handle their strada machine), but I do think their coffee standard drops. I used to love coming here for my caffeine fix bc of its proximity to my office. But now I'd have to think again to come back for their coffee... and maybe for their mains.","231":"Coming for lunch. I had a carbonara and my hubby got a tom yum pasta. Free drink that worths below S$5 for every main purchased. Both me and my hubby got picolo latte, single shot. We both loved our coffee. Pasta is okay. Considering that it is around S$12-18 per main, good taste is definitely expected. However I still have to give thumbs up for their creativity creating tom yum pasta. It tastes good. Never crossed my mind that tom yum \u00c2\u00a0taste and pasta could go together and actually make a great dish.","232":"Haven't had the food, but the coffee is on point. Some of the best espresso based drinks I've had in Singapore. The mason jar tiramisu was good too.","233":"All day breakfast - had the big one. \u00c2\u00a0Lovely and imaginative. \u00c2\u00a0Well prepared and good vaiue.They do coffee prepared every way you can imagine (pour over, press, aeropress, suction, you name it) so you get to try different ways to see what you like. \u00c2\u00a0Excellent coffee though the wife's latte was a bit too sweet for my taste.Worth a stop if you're around Arab Street. \u00c2\u00a0Didn't try the roof cocktails but will definitely be back for another breakfast and coffee.","234":"This is the place to head to if you want to break free from the mediterranean-saturated Arab st and you happen to be in the area. It's probably the only place of its kind in that enclave. I was looking for a good coffee boost but didn't want to have turkish coffee so my friend brought me to this place, it's along the row of shophouses just opposite the malay heritage centre. It's got a very welcoming cozy vibe - the kind that invites you to just hang out here for hours. I ordered an iced latte (loved how it was served in a generous portion of a jar!) and had a red velvet. Indeed I got the coffee boost I wanted and more! The coffee was beautifully prepared, with alot of love. The red velvet was a nice accompaniment though it was quite a huge slice that I couldn't finish it.Haven't been to the other floors of this place but definitely have become enough of a fan of the cafe to check the rest of the place out!Final verdict: A good break from middle eastern food and atmosphere of arab st!","235":"This place is kinda like a department store, but way, way, way cooler. Great aesthetics link all three floors, and it's one place I can actually can get something (read: spend money) on every floor.On the ground, the cafe serves up some serious coffee - manager Rizuan roasts the beans himself, and the baristas all have experience. Get Welly to pour you a signature MI Latte - he's pretty good. Heck, even the chef's a bit of a barista himself! Oh and the food's pretty good too. Try the weekend brunches. Or grab a musubi if you're in a hurry (spam on sushi rice? yeah.)Second level houses a menswear boutique. Cult brands, decent selection. I've been making eyes at some Miansai accessories for ages... picked up some Twins for Peace shoes instead. #firstworldproblemsTop floor is a boutique cocktail bar. Now if you remember a mixologist called Leslie who used to be at another bar a couple streets away... I found him. He's a smooth operator, and he's got a wealth of experience. Test him for as much as your cocktail's worth.","236":"There's a stark contrast between old and new taking place in Maison Ikkoku. On a quiet side street, the calm of a quiet Saturday afternoon is broken by the hum of conversation and the hiss of milk being steamed under pressure. The painted brick walls with industrial style copper pipes and light fixtures are far removed from the original shophouse that was here, and are closer to a contemporary urban studio apartment. There are some quirky touches also, with old pieces of furniture suspended from the walls, and doors recycled into tables on an outdoor terrace.An espresso shot is the foundation of many different coffees. It's hard to make a bad drink with a good espresso, and so much easier to make a bad drink with an over extracted shot. The espresso shot that I ordered arrived with a medium dark brown crema, and a small volume of coffee. (The crema colour is an indicator of freshness. If it's pale, it's stale, which is why I always make a note of this. The small volume suggests that the shot was not over extracted, which would give rise to unpleasant flavours in the shot, as non soluble coffee grounds end up in the cup). It was bitter, with hints of woody flavours, and a slightly thick mouthfeel. The aftertaste was bold and lasting - overall a well executed espresso. So far, so good. I ordered a latte also. The espresso was definitely muted by the milk. It was smooth, with the coffee flavour not lost or drowned out by the milk. However, the overall quality is reduced by the presence of larger bubbles in the milk foam - this is something that I have seen before in Maison Ikkoku. This might seem like the most minor and insignificant point imaginable, but there are valid underlying reasons for pointing this out. Larger bubbles do not impart the same silky smooth mouthfeel that microfoam does. Also, the baristas have gone to the effort of creating latte art. Unfortunately, larger bubbles cause the foam to break apart, so the overall affect is lost after a few minutes. This is something that is fixable, and it's a shame to see their efforts go to waste for the sake of a small change to the steaming technique. It's also the difference between a very good latte, and an average one. One thing to bear in mind however - the point above is simply not relevant for anyone who prefers drip or brewed coffee, and might not even be an issue for anyone else. \u00c2\u00a0There is also a good selection of brewed and drip coffees available for anyone with different tastes. Pourover coffees are on the menu, along with cold dripped, syphon, aeropress, andV60 all available as options. Coffee choices include pretty much everything except ristretto shots. That's ok though, there's more than enough on offer. One thing that Maison Ikkoku does well is the pairing of different bean types to different brewing methods, and the baristas are well versed in which method to pair to which bean. This is great to see, and speaks volumes about the cafe, and the owners intentions and reasons for starting. Prices as are expected - $8.50 for the latte and cappuccino above - and broadly in line with what is charged in other quality cafes. Along with Smitten and Chye Seng Huat Hardware, Maison Ikkoku has a very well stocked retail section, with accessories that are not always found elsewhere. There is a good selection of items for brewed or filtered coffees, including Chemex and V60 coffee drippers, cone filters and syphons. There are also tampers on sale for home baristas. Unfortunately, Maison Ikkoku does not sell coffee beans. This is something that I would like to see happen, as there are some interesting blends and single origins \u00c2\u00a0from Columbia and El Salvador being used. Overall, 4 stars, as the selection of brewing methods available, and the quality of espresso, makes up for the steaming issue described above (which will not affect everyone), but it's unfortunate to see this when everything else is done so well. Also, Maison Ikkoku can be very crowded at weekends, with queues for seats - opening the second floor cocktail bar during the day would help to alleviate this. It's certainly worth a visit, and along with Symmetry and EspressoLab, is a good choice for anyone craving caffeine in the Arab Street area.","237":"This place knows some of my exes and the some cocktails I love most.","238":"The good: Cafe - Fantastic coffee, atmosphere\/music, service\/staff, food, location; in that order. This place rates as my all around favorite cafe in SG. Boutique - Great Japanese brands, mostly for men. \u00c2\u00a0Bought a few things, decent options and easy to chat with staff. \u00c2\u00a0Great way kill time while waiting for a table. \u00c2\u00a0Bar - Friendly (and skilled) bartender, tasty tasty drinks. 2nd favorite cocktail bar in Singapore (Tippling Club reigns as #1, no surprise there). \u00c2\u00a0The bad: Cafe - Food has taken a nosedive since opening. Change in chef\/recipe? \u00c2\u00a0Something is off, because before it was the best eggs benedict and now it's just average. Tiramisu is to die for, literally. \u00c2\u00a0Gave me and my friend a stomach ache. Always crowded, so be prepared to wait.Boutique - Would love more options\/sizes. Bar - A bit too congested and pricey. Need cheap\/beer options. \u00c2\u00a0Haven't been in awhile, I hope they added a free\/self serve water option because it wasn't there before. \u00c2\u00a0The ugly: If the drop in food quality is any indication, this could be one of those great venues that gets popular and forgets about the little things that made it so. I'm optimistic though because it seems that the staff actually cares.","239":"OMG love the drinks here. Its one of those, don't have a menu but tell me what you want type of speakeasy-ish bars. while the decor isn't that of a speakeasy - the drinks are the classy types that reminds you of one. Try to go early on a random week day to get a seat at the bar, so you can see the amount of care and skill that goes into each drink. I love watching the mixologist (okay, NOT just \"bartenders\", but this is some classy stuff - so \"mixologists\" it is) going at it with each drink, pounding away on the berries\/cucumbers for super fresh flavors, slapping the mint (NOT just ripping it up like how ppl usually do, but SLAPPING it), and lighting up rosemary on fire for extra flavoring and a show. drinks are amazing here - the only time i've had to have something re-done was for Maison's version of a bloody mary, it wasn't that it was bad, but it was just too spicy. overall - i always have a great time here, chill vibe, classy music and decor, and most importantly, each drink makes me feel so special. It's a big plus that the mixologists are super nice and friendly, chats away with you and explains things to you if you are curious. you must hit up this place if you are in town.","240":"They make drinks from all fresh vegetables and fruits. \u00c2\u00a0Had the Bloody Mary and it's amazing.","241":"Poor customer service... mosquito flying around ur cake ....dont know if they even open \u00c2\u00a0air condition","242":"Excellent coffee and brunch items. The actual seating area that is next to the coffee counter is very small and cramped, so go early or expect to wait. I like there house special brew but they have the usual other options. Worth a visit if you are around Arab or Kanadahar Street in Singapore.","243":"Top notch coffee, in a trendy part of town. Free fast wifi and nice interior.","244":"This is a cool place to hang out with friends. Always crowded during weekends but adds to the atmosphere. Food is quite good too. Highly recommended!","245":"Don't particularly like the design or atmosphere of this place. But the coffee is good and the food is good and the service is good. Generally, it's a great place for a good study session.","246":"one of coolest place in town!! the cocktail at the terrace are just amazing top quality!! try the one with coffe!! omg blow u away!!","247":"There has been a trend in the last couple years of converting shophouses into amazing little restaurants. \u00c2\u00a0My favorite in this genre recently is Maison Ikkoku. \u00c2\u00a0Not only is the building itself gorgeous but the interior use of space and design compliments it well. \u00c2\u00a0My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch last Sunday and the place was packed so be prepared for the wait. \u00c2\u00a0There are plenty of magazines to accommodate that or you could leave your number and have them call you. \u00c2\u00a0When we sat down the waiters were attentive and took our order quickly. \u00c2\u00a0I had the Umami Florentine and C had a Croquet Madame. \u00c2\u00a0He said it was the best he has ever had which is saying something. \u00c2\u00a0While I loved my mushroomy eggs Florentine I thought the hollandaise sauce was a tad on the mustardy side. \u00c2\u00a0I would like to try the salmon version next. \u00c2\u00a0We could order everything at once and they held off making our coffee until we were done with our meal. \u00c2\u00a0That latte was so good! It almost had a nutty flavor. I'm guessing it's the way they roast the beans. \u00c2\u00a0They also are hitting on the trend of offering a ton of different coffee preparation styles: French press, vacuum, whatever. \u00c2\u00a0C's coffee was superb. \u00c2\u00a0The only downside to this fabulous little eatery is that we felt bad holding the table so we quickly sipped our coffee and skedaddled. \u00c2\u00a0I'm totally going back next weekend.","248":"The sandwich \/ salad + drink combo for lunch is great! Love the sandwiches and salads.","249":"I don't drink much coffee so I feel like I'm kinda missing out on the whole point of this place. That said, it's got a really chill vibe, perfect for lazy weekends. The red velvet cake was good.","250":"Just had a lovely meal here with my family. We had the duo bag in mild sauce, lobster in garlic butter, fish & chips, and chicken with waffles. Loved every dish. Service was attentive & quick, including the owner who was really hospitable. Will be back.","251":"Wonderful surprise, staff are so nice, and given the location, almost felt like we'd left Singapore. Crab cakes awesome, more crap than filler, sweet potato fries also perfect, 4 Seafood bags (Dungeness) fed 14 of us perfectly, with some to bring back. Huge prawns. Chilean Sauvignon Blanc washed it all down nicely. Only gripe, and hope management reads social media, is that they must refrigerate their ketchup. It was 'off' and had turned an unsightly, unappealing dark red color, with a nasty tang.","252":"Amazing seafood and the atmosphere is great!!! Came here with a pretty good sized group of 9 people. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the food was phenomenal. Ordered the $89 seafood bag and left more than satisfied. Must try the Yuzu ginza. My favorite drink of the night!!! If you're looking for a great place to eat and enjoy the atmosphere of Singapore this is the place to be.","253":"One of our favourite restaurants. Warm, friendly staff. Very helpful and took time to explain their menu every time we visited. The seafood and lobster are delicious and the sides are great as well! Value for money and be ready to get messy!","254":"A very messy place to have seafood. A copy of of seafood places you'll see in American costal towns and cities. Good food but a bit pricy. Dinner for 6 adults and 6 kids cost S$491, and we only ordered 2 bags of seafood. And 8 baskets of fries and rings.","255":"We kicked off the lobster relvery with the Live whole Boston lobsters that are available in three different sauces. The Works (spiciness ranging from mild to raging hot), Garlic Butter and Peppa Butter. The Works is piquant with an assam-like tang, but not too spicy. With lobsters shipped in daily from US, the taste can hardly go wrong. Sweet and not overcooked, the chunky fleshes might be a hassle to remove from the shells at first but all efforts were rewarded when you mopped down with the sauces.But we soon found out that it's got more to offer than the lobster. Pick from brown crabs, prawns, mussels, clams and then choose your sauce. That said, the heartiest way to round off the evening is to feast on the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139\/4); literally a seafood bomb filled with everything including sausages, corns and some deep-fried mantou buns at the side for soaking up the juices. The starters were overall quite impressive too. The Louisiana Spicy Mid Joint Wings ($8.90) were zappy with a nice sour kick that makes you grab for more. The Southern Chicks and Waffles ($9.90) had plenty of crisp, not only in the chicken but more importantly in the waffles that were drizzled in maple syrup. I shy away from the Bacon Shrimp ($11.90) in smoky Hickory sauce because they were too salty. As for the Fish & Chips ($12.90), it's a classic in its own league. The fish stayed moist and piping hot within a light, crunchy batter. The Signature Lobsicle ($15.90), aka lobster on Popsicle, might be safer in the Boiler instead of the deep fryer as they were too chewy.Business was so good that the chocolate molten lava cake ran out of stock and so we settled for the C.B.D, a pungent pun on the business district of Singapore because it stood for Crispy Banana Durians. Forget about the Bananas were substituted by yams that night, cos the pungent durians have already stolen the limelight. As we all know, never judge a restaurant by the history or the location. Despite being opened only for a few months, it's no nonsense when it comes to the Cajun-style lobsters here. Walk in, sit down and put on the apron. We did. And we ate. We ate very well indeed.","256":"'ello 'ello 'ello *i trimmed my nails and wore dark clothing for the visit to the mighty crab temple* Who would have thought there'd be a Louisiana seafood themed restaurant situated in the middle of nowhere. And what's even more ridiculous is the large amounts of Hoomans here. On a Tuesday work night! Uh huh.Ok so the plan. Order the sriracha fries. Order the bom diggity bag. Grab someone who has a birthday on that month and you get a complimentary lobster. Fries for the win!! Your day is now complete. Not part of the plan: Echoey area.. This is NOT the place for intelligent conversations and discussions about your philosophies of life. Reserve and call in advance. If not you're just watching people eat. Backstreet boys playing in the background. Wut","257":"It is all about Southern American Cajun seafood boil on our sunny island these days and we checked The Boiler, a gem tucked in the ulu and industrious Tai Seng estate. It's a queer location for a seafood spot but we absolutely dig the cavernous space and their delicious offerings. It made perfect sense for us to order the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139) since there's a huge group of us (we had 3 bags of that). Each bag feeds more than the recommended 4 pax (that or we are small eaters). Dungeness or Brown Crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, and corn are tossed with a sauce of your choice. For the sauce, there's garlic butter (for the kiddos), pepper butter (for amateurs), mild, medium and raging spice. Of the lot, i thought that the mild worked the best. It was more savory than the bland and boring garlic butter, but not too spicy to give you a heartburn or mar the taste of the seafood. Of the ingredients in the bag, I loved the succulent and juicy prawns, the salty chorizo style sausages, and not to mention the sweet corn! The juicy kernels provided a respite from the spices after a while. Get a lobster ($49) to go with your meal! Same price as Pince and Pints but without the queue (just make a reservation)! I liked this better than the crabs. Lemon butter was a good choice as the sauce is lighter and simpler, which allowed the freshness of the lobster to come through. The pepper butter can be rather overwhelming with spice in my opinion and not quite suitable for this meat.If you're not up for a seafood feasting, you could also do smaller meals such as fish and chips, chicken and waffles, and hot dogs as well. For desserts, we had the Molten Lava cake ($9.90) which remained fairly decent even after all the photo taking. The almond (mocha?) ice cream with Oreo crunch was a hit with us. Skip the fried banana and durian fritters ($7.90) with salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It sounded way more exotic than it tasted and certainly not quite worth the price for fried pisang. Plus it had a stale oily taste.We really enjoyed our meal while it lasted. It was fun passing food around with our bare hands and letting loose at the dining table. However, the gastric reflux was pretty severe and the garlic aftertaste lingered long after the meal concluded. In fact, it's pretty nauseating thinking about it right now. So yes, it's a once in a blue moon indulgence for us. That said, I'd certainly recommend The Boiler for a gathering with family and friends! What's your favorite seafood boil?","258":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by The Boiler.I haven't yet eaten at Cajun Kings, Crab in a Bag, or Dancing Crab, but it's clear that Louisiana-style seafood is the new big thing here.Made my reservations online via Chope the afternoon off even though it was for Sunday dinner. I didn't think it'd be that crowded but boy was I wrong. For a restaurant located in the middle of an industrial zone, on a Sunday night, this place was PACKED. When we got there every table was full, and the nearest roadside parking was two streets down. Surprising, to say the least.But hey, free parking on Sundays and after 5pm (I think) on weekdays means that despite its inaccessibility, it's quite worth driving in!We were a large group of 10 people, so we got to order a fairly broad range of items. We ordered two of their bags (feeds four each), one mildly spicy, one garlic butter. We ordered a lobster (medium spicy) because it was on offer, and plenty of sides. Seafood first.For $140+ per bag, it's good value. You get something like a whole crab, 6-8 pieces of prawns (maybe more, I wasn't counting), sausage, corn, mussels, clams, and some fried buns. The sauces are good too. The garlic butter was buttery rich and very garlicky. My only criticism is that by the time you're reaching the end of the bag, it's really heavy going. Conversely, the spicy sauces are less flavourful when you start out, but so much cleaner and lighter on the palate that you can keep going for longer. Mild spice is pretty disappointing for someone with the average Singaporean spice tolerance. I highly recommend medium. The corn in the bag was good, sweet and not overcooked. The crabs weren't the freshest I'd ever had, but they were still sweet and tasty.I wouldn't bother recommending the lobsicles, which are bite-sized bits of deep fried lobster, despite their fame. There's just nothing special about them. The Momma's Potato Scoops are basically just wedges served with cheese sauce, and the Spam Fries are spammier than most places. Not as crisp as they could have been either. The coleslaw was average, fresh tasting, but it felt very odd eating coleslaw by hand. I also feel the Jamaican alcoholic ginger beer is worth special mention. The alcohol taste is light, the ginger taste strong, and it's a great drink if you love ginger beer in general. (Though it's a bit sweet)The best part of the entire meal was really that, drinks included, everything came out to only $70 per person. Considering the amount we ate? Definitely worth it. Quite looking forward to heading back to try the maximum spice level!","259":"Good, but lacking in a few bits of Louisiana culture.DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY. You have been warned!*Pros* The food is decent. The taste of the seafood in a bag is definitely cajun, and well marinated with the works. One whole bag (I can't remember which one I got) had enough crabs, prawns, mussels, cockles, corn and sausages enough for two to share. We also had the boston lobster (the price was on special!) marinated in garlic butter. The mid-joint wings was also pretty decent!*Cons* Missing mallets! Mallets would be helpful, especially for the lobsters! And perhaps extra wet-wipes and napkins? How about putting a kitchen roll at the table?And what happened to the root beer? Cajun-style seafood dinners demand either beer, or root beer if you are driving... And I was driving. The waitress told us that they used to carry root beer, but stopped due to low demand. She also told us a few things were no longer on the menu due to pricing costs, including the every popular lobster-sicle. Recommended: The Works Sauce, no matter what seafood you are getting! The bags are good value.The removal of some essential items that make it a truly Louisiana experience was pretty sad, as I have experienced \u00c2\u00a0authentic US cajun before and unfortunately this was a derivative of the actual thing. But more importantly, which I hope the owners can probably read this, is that the marinade could possibly use a little stronger taste. The seafood is well marinated, but the cajun flavor I feel wasn't strong enough.Overall, knowing that the restaurant is new, I'll give them a thumbs up for their effort, and hope that they can improve the authenticity and overall feel of southern-style seafood!","260":"visited the broiler with family to celebrate the younger brother's birthday. it was more of an experience than i would say the food. food was just average but cheaper than the other louisanna seafood stores.given the crowd on a sunday night(fullhouse) , maybe im missing out on something i wonder. drinks wise,i had the beertini which is their version of beer and martini - turned out to be quite a refreshing choice to go with the seafood","261":"Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Singapore. Good was delicious and semi-healthy (not fried or overloaded with sugar). The food was served quickly and the lack of plates made for an interesting dining experience. One may be hesitant to dig in and get their hands dirty but this is a good ol American styled prawn feast... you just gotta get in there.","262":"Fabulous dinning place. Great seafood, cosy place and warm services !!! Try them, we liked it!!!","263":"An excellent rendition of Louisiana style cooking. I've been to Boiling Crab in California. Was like looking for a similar experience here in Singapore and here it is! \"The works\" is the sauce here which is comparable to \"the whole shabang \" at the boiling crab. But the Pepper Butter sauce here is simply outstanding! It's a must try. The service staff are friendly and accommodating. They even offer you a plastic sleeve for your handphone in case you need to answer a call while your hands are covered in sauce... And yes , you need to use both your hands for a wholesome experience! The bib provided is clear plastic so it's not Selfie friendly but it gets the job done though. A wonderful place to hangout with friends and family. The beverage list is not bad , they have fruity refreshing beers and a wine selection too. To top it all off would be \"The Molten chocolate lava cake\"! With a soothing cup of coffee! Bon Appetite!","264":"The seafood is not fresh. The sauce that came with it tasted bland. Even though the service is good, I wont be coming back","265":"I wanted to say thank you again to your shop and all of your staff. Literally, some of the best customer service in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. \u00c2\u00a0The food and cakes are amazing, and we will definitely return! FYI - The ondeh ondeh cake is the best that we have tried...seriously!","266":"Started my meal with the Malayan Wings, a spicy (just right) starter. Six wings is a meal, so pace yourself. The wings were a juice delight. My main course was the Smoked Duck Chili Padi. Another spicy selection, done at a perfect level of hotness for me. The linguini was cooked to nice firmness and flavor. The Lychee Mint Cooler was a perfect beverage to go with this meal. The service was exceptional, friendly and smooth.I finished a wonderful meal with an over the top delicious piece of Durian Pengat cake. Yes durian, if you are lucky enough to enjoy this fruit, you are in for a sweet treat. And if durian is not for you, not to worry, you find a flavor to you taste inthe amazing selection of cakes!I highly recommended The Malayan Coumcil for at least one of you meals while in Singapore!","267":"Having ondeh ondeh cake. Looks good. Cafe ambiance nice. The cakes here do look good. Did not have a chance to try the mains though. But will return to this interesting little cafe.","268":"I've had brunch there once and enjoyed the salted egg crab pasta the most. Portions are huge so I'd advise sharing so you'll have room for dessert... Like their ondeh ondeh cake! I loved it so much I ordered some for my mum's and aunt's birthday. We had some snafus with the delivery service initially but Hafiz was quick to rectify and mistakes and provide a solution. TMC can count on me as a repeat customer!","269":"You need to try the signature soy chicken dishes. The soy chicken is tender and tasty. You have to try with either noodle or rice. I loved the soy sauce lor Mee as you can see from the photos! Very tasty dish, not dry but enough sauce to coat the noodles served with crispy roast pork ! The Haikee Brother meal deal is value for money as you get two serves of the soy chicken and rice, share a soup and two drinks. The century egg congee with bbq char siew was generous with the century egg. A huge bowl for sharing with others. A great place for a meal, reasonable in price.","270":"As a California native, i was really happy to had been recommended John's pizza since Singapore pizza spots rarely fall under the American pizza category (plenty of Italian wine bar types around). The pizza is made to order and comes in 2 main forms: New York (thin) style, and deep dish. Since deep dish seemed like their signature, my boyfriend and I split the Jonh's 4 way. The edges were crispy from all the cheese fried in the pan, and the dough was thick but fluffy, retaining a good chewy texture. Only wish was there there were more of the sauce and toppings! Just because the crust was so thick, it felt like it could use a little more sauce on top.","271":"Great location with easy access via MRT. Stopped at esplanade station and walk up to enjoy the magnificent architecture of JW Marriott hotel. Check out the fountain with Bruce Lee's quote. We made a reservation last Feb at BRK to celebrate an engagement this June. Communication with BRK prior to our arrival has been via email and they were responsive and helpful. On the day of our celebration, we were seated in the area behind the noodles station next to the bar. we had the entire space there and it felt like we had the whole place. The space was beautiful. We had 9 folks around a large table and another table of 6 off to the side. The smaller table was intimate. The large table was comfortable. It was a huge table so trying to have a conversation across the table is not recommended. Plan your seating chart well. It worked out for us. Food is delicious! There is a huge spread of food from seafood to grill to local delicacies like hainanese chicken rice. Plan your trips well. I think it is impossible to sample everything BRK has to offer but I'm sure they have something for your craving when you get there. Chili crab? Black vinegar trotters? Grilled pork? Noodles? Razor clams? Fresh oysters? They have it all. I did not eat every item available but our group of 14 came close. Mathan and his team including Jane was very attentive. Mathan offered to bring grilled fishes to the table to save us waiting. At the end of our meal, mathan and Jane brought out a cake with a candle on it for the couple. That's so thoughtful. I would recommend Beach Road Kitchen to anyone looking for a buffet meal anytime in a nice part of town.","272":"Open early around 6am-10am to JW Marriott guests for a full breakfast buffet. \u00c2\u00a0The service and food was amazing. Ask for a cappuccino or a latte instead of coffee from the bar although the coffee was great also. The staff is so friendly and ensure that your meal is pleasant. They offer a variety of traditional Asian dishes, fresh fruit, waffle bar, juices, a noodle bar, and freshly made omelettes. I looked forward to this buffet since it was included in the room rental. It would be rather expensive to eat here otherwise.","273":"Incredible Sunday birthday brunch...local, Indian, grill, seafood, the Full Monty ... but the service was stellar from servers to baloon lady to station chefs (esp Gana at seafood) to everyone who serenaded my Daughter and gave us special cake. \u00c2\u00a0One of best buffets in my 33 years.When the sashimi is Super fresh and tasty it tells you a lot about their standards. \u00c2\u00a0Will remember this for Ma y years.","274":"Went here for breakfast, and while a bit pricy it was great. All items were very fresh and the cold section was amazing... felt like I was walking through the fruit and vegetable section at the grocery. Fresh pastries, eggs to order and a good selection with many stations. Coffee and espresso here was great as well. With they included fresh squeezed juice for the price, saw them pouring orange juice from a jug then placing above the oranges in the fresh section.","275":"I have celiac disease and struggled to find places in Singapore that were safe to eat. \u00c2\u00a0As I was staying at the JW Marriott, I was advised to go here and speak to the chef. \u00c2\u00a0Chef Sid walked me through the a la Carte menu to help me find a good lunch item. \u00c2\u00a0The following morning, he also walked me through the buffet to help me find options.I had breakfast here each morning of my 6 day stay and was wonderfully surprised to see that the team had added an all new gluten free muffin bar complete with individually wrapped muffins to avoid cross contamination! \u00c2\u00a0I was so impressed that Chef Sid took the initiative after learning about the challenges for Gluten sensitive\/celiacs to add this offering and to reconfigure their budgets to meet our needs. \u00c2\u00a0He was even thoughtful about where he placed it (near fruit, cheese and cold cut sections) so that gluten sensitive customers didn't have to walk near the bread area. \u00c2\u00a0Wow! \u00c2\u00a0Thank you Chef Sid!","276":"Amazing food. Great service. Anyone from the pickiest eater to a foodie will find something that rocks here.","277":"The BEST brunch I've ever had in my life. No joke. Plenty of different stations to try but hands down my favorite was the fruits station and soup station. And can't forget about freshly squeezed juice. This place has a huge assortment of foods--I craved it so much I had to come back during my limited time here.","278":"At $42 (Sing dollars) plus 17% per person, this place is a splurge that is well worth it as long as you come hungry. The breakfast buffet has a very wide selection of eastern and western cuisine and diverse grouping should all be satisfied. Not to miss: Kaya crepe was exquisite. Fresh young coconut juice was sweet and refreshing. Fresh fruit bar with local and international fruits. Coffee is excellent. They make a good flat white. The chicken congee was very tasty. \u00c2\u00a0They make eggs, waffle and crepes to order. There's a noodle and young tau foo bar. And a salad \u00c2\u00a0bar. Restaurant is nice--open and relaxing. Service is very attentive. Nasi lemak was good but the otah was mushy and not smoked enough. Curry chicken was excellent. Selection of smoked fish included smoked herring and a number of different kinds of lox. Laksa would be a good addition to the buffet.","279":"Great breakfast! Like most breakfast buffets in Asia it has a wide range of \"stations\" ranging from an egg station to a salad bar. Each of the stations were wonderful...except the waffle station. The two mornings I ate there the waffle station was not manned so the only option was a cold waffle. I would imagine that it usually is manned...but since it wasn't manned when I was there I didn't get the change to experience it.","280":"I almost never write poor reviews and count on one hand with fingers to spare the number of times I have sent food back and for the first time in my life have refused to include gratuity.I came in at just after 11:00 AM on a Sunday looking for some breakfast. \u00c2\u00a0The hostess really didn't want me to come in telling me I had to leave by noon because a large party was coming in.\"Fine, I'll order quick.\"I got seated and asked about drinks. \u00c2\u00a0Flat white and a water, fine.I took a look at the menu, certainly not cheap by stretch but I am on the company dime.I'll get an omelet. Safe, easy, vegetarian. \u00c2\u00a0The waitress didn't know what an omelet was even though I was ordering from the menu. \u00c2\u00a0She had to talk to the chef twice, I just wanted \u00c2\u00a0cheese and vegetables (I even said I didn't care). \u00c2\u00a0The chef even came out to find out what I wanted to make sure. \u00c2\u00a0Potatoes come with it. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Coffee comes.... no water.... waiting...waiting... \u00c2\u00a0Out comes the chef with the omelete.... it has sauage on the side. No, that isn't going to work. \u00c2\u00a0I said 3 times I was a vegetarian.Then the omelet comes again, the eggs are scorched. \u00c2\u00a0Eggs aren't supposed to be brown. \u00c2\u00a0There are 5 tiny potatoes, one of which is bad (brown in the middle), no seasoning. My water comes.I am done here. \u00c2\u00a0They send out another waiter to try to smooth things over. \u00c2\u00a0I asked, \"Where would you eat?\" \u00c2\u00a0At least I got something out of it.","281":"Open for dinner, $78 Sing ++. Suggest skip wine pairing. Fantastic seafood room! Great sashimi, crab, smoked salmon, fresh anchovies, ceviche. Veggies good - roasted fennel, asparagus. Fresh papaya superb. Nice evening all in all.","282":"Went here for breakfast as i was staying at the hotel next door and nothing else was open at 6 am, jetlagged. \u00c2\u00a0Omg, fantastic spread for breakfast, went straight for the local foods. It was so delish i forgot about getting the usual standby, bacon eggs bagels. \u00c2\u00a0Which they had as well. \u00c2\u00a0 The cappacino was great and included in \u00c2\u00a0the price of the buffet. \u00c2\u00a0 Highly recommend this place. The staff were very nice to boot.","283":"For 9 SGD, you can get the crawfish asian delight laksa which is what they're known for. \u00c2\u00a0Loved the cockles, chicken and crawfish. \u00c2\u00a0The broth is coconut curry like and they provide a spoon of their red paste with it that works wonders. \u00c2\u00a0Wanted to go back for more. \u00c2\u00a0The line wasn't long at noon on Monday. \u00c2\u00a0Would definitely come back.","284":"Again this is a matter of personal preference but I thought it was just ok. \u00c2\u00a0It's on the 2nd floor of a rather large food center, a bit difficult to locate but with the help of good Samaritans I found it just as it opened for lunch.Broth: 2\/5, to me this is the most important component of any laksa. \u00c2\u00a0Unlike the typical SGP laksas that are loaded with curry and coconut milk, this version sticks with the basic seafood flavor. \u00c2\u00a0I am a big fan of Cantonese style seafood soup, I also liked the Assam style laksa broth in Penang, but I found this broth somewhat bland. \u00c2\u00a0My partner and I both looked at each other & said \"where is the flavor\"? Perhaps it was just a bad batch from that day?Noodle and seafood:4\/5, I paid extra to get the bowl loaded with shrimps and crawfish (baby lobster), noodles was good, no complaints here.Value: 4\/5, even with all the extra seafood loaded in my bowl I think it was only like $9 SGP, which is a great deal. \u00c2\u00a0if you eat in a nice restaurant the price can easily be doubled if not more.Overall I was somewhat disappointed by this famous laksa, the broth in particular was a letdown for me.","285":"I had my first Laksa ever just yesterday here, and I must say that it was honestly a fantastic experience. Located in a corner of Singapore's Chinatown, Famous Sungei Road Trikshaw Laksa is one stall among the many hawker stalls located in Chinatown. Given this fact, it took a little searching and a lot of google map checking to find this place.Despite the relative difficulty of finding this place though, the search is more than worth the effort. The Laksa here has a thick, rich soup similar to the best ramen shops I have been to while in Japan. And each bowl of Laksa has a large helping of seafood with a generous setving of noodles. However, what is perhaps the most surprising thing about the Laksa here is that the broth is able to preserve its rich taste by relying on seafood products as opposed to using fattier meats and other animal products (pork, beef, etc.).The price here is also ideal at under 10 singaporean dollars a bowl. This is a place I would highly recommend.","286":"This has been my favorite thing I've tried so far in Singapore. The rich, seafood\/curry broth is amazing. The noodles are nice and springy, and the Lobster was perfectly cooked! Another stand out about this place was how friendly the owners were. There are so many wonderful things to try in Singapore, but I will have to go back to this stand before my trip is over. Pro tip: If you want to get all the seafood toppings, you must get there before 3pm.","287":"Reasonable 15 minute queue at 1215 on a Friday. Ordered the large Fruit Juice Mee Siam with Crayfish ($9), which was served up fast by the very friendly and cheerful owner.And wow. This Mee Siam was special - the owner wouldn't divulge the recipe, but it was unique and refreshing. The Crayfish was a special add and worth it - freshly chopped and made in front of you. One of Singapore's hawker gems.","288":"Laksa. The quintessential Singaporean noodle soup. If you're a visitor to Singapore then you undoubtedly want to find some place that does it pretty well. If you're a local, then you probably already have your thoughts on who does it best. I've had my fair share of bowls of laksa during my few trips to Singapore. The particular bowl we ordered from here will forever stand out in my memory as the best I've tasted thus far and they have made me a future repeat customer on any subsequent visits to the hot and humid city-state.Containing all the seafood items inside a typical bowl of laksa, it didn't have any trace of old fishy flavor or aroma that has happened on a few occasions that I've experienced elsewhere. Instead it had a much more rather sweet and savory mix of flavors and aroma. The laksa here really impressed me down to the toothsome noodles. Every spoonful really had that \"oh, man, that's good\" kind of feel. It's no wonder the Michelin guide payed them a visit and recommended them.","289":"Very good Laksa just like the review said.Trishaw Laksa is already well known and has its own following. This stall in Hong Lim has no Yelp till now.The broth is excellent, worthy of mention. The white noodles is soft tender, very easy to scoop and eat even without chopsticks. $4 is decent for Laksa. There are many good Laksa around.For the $5 Laksa, they added probably half a prawn, 3 pieces of white chicken. For the $7 version, they add a crayfish on top of that.Knock yourself out.","290":"Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa is amazing. Search the Hawker Center for the long cue, but it's well worth the wait! \u00c2\u00a0The owner is very friendly and proud of his well deserved awards. Seafood Laksa with lobster, get the large. Very fresh and not too spicy. Goes well with the pressed cane sugar juice with lemon available next door.","291":"I was looking for Yelp Help for our last dinner on a recent trip to Singapore and found this. We were a party of 10 adults and 2 toddlers, back from a full day at the zoo and quite hungry. The first timers in the group had a bit of time to walk down a stretch of Orchard Rd, then I wanted a nice resto for after.We ordered: scallop and crab meat fried rice (our group's absolute favorite!), crispy roast chicken (sooo good), sauteed broccoli with scallops (excellent dish and beautiful presentation, with pretty shells on the plate). Those were the standouts, but really everything we had was good, including the roast pork, three kinds of vegetables in oyster sauce, and the last two orders of xiao long bao from dimsum lunch. Lemon iced tea was yummy here too!Service was helpful, kind, and efficient. This was the cherry on top of a really good dinner. I'll definitely be back!","292":"Best restaurant we had while we were in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Traditional Cantonese cuisine at Orchard road. \u00c2\u00a0The price was kind of high though, we ordered just small portions because we weren't hungry. Everything was high quality, no complaints. \u00c2\u00a0The other thing is they charge for the wet towels, which for the price we paid for was kind of ridiculous. \u00c2\u00a0When I compare prices, this is high even for Bay Area restaurants we're accustomed to (which are pretty expensive). \u00c2\u00a0 So if you don't mind the price, it is a good option for Cantonese cuisine while you're in Singapore.","293":"Probably one of my favorite dim sum place in Singaporea. Greta service and awesome location. They have one of the best congee I've ever tried but it's filling so share it. By far the most smooth and silky congee I've ever tasted. I've tried almost every dim sum dish here and here are some of my favorites:Golden Yolk BunBBQ pork pastryBBQ pork bunXiao Long Bao (soup is way better than DTF)Century Egg CongeeSiew MaiSiu YokPumpkin Pastry","294":"Really liking this Chinese restaurant. This is a must-go restaurant if you are craving for dim sum.The dim sum was top notch- \u00c2\u00a0we ordered siew mai, shrimp rice roll - excellent because the rice roll wrap was thin, and the sauce complements it a lot although the sauce could be a bit more as I eat the sauce with rice.. :p, and the ha kau was delish.From the menu, we ordered a few dishes as well. We ordered kai lan in oyster sauce, and I strongly recommend you guys to order the diced beef in black pepper sauce. The beef was so tender and and the black pepper sauce was just as nice, rich but very subtle once you take a bite. The duck was also very good, and the tofu with minced beef was a great balance. \u00c2\u00a0All of the food we ordered was very good- none were just okay. Definitely our favorite Chinese restaurant!","295":"Been here many times and the food is always first class here. I love the pork stomach soup, truffle noodles yum.Only problem on this occasion was the melon soup was off and had to be taken away. Not sure how they let that leave the kitchen.","296":"If you're a fan of dim sum, look no further. I had to go there twice during my days in Singapore. Highly recommended, but do expect to pay a bit more than usual.","297":"Great place for Dim Sum. Really tasty and authentic. \u00c2\u00a0Steamed dishes are really delicate. Variety of stuff on the menu, and the staff are really friendly & helpful. Overall great! The only minor downside is that service can be just a bit slow on weekends, but worth the wait!","298":"The quality of the dim sum items here is super fine! I really believe that the standard of a dim sum restaurant is defined by 2 items - Har Gao and Char Siew Bao. And they kill both items well!The best part is that after we feasted till we're so full, the bill was only about $20 per pax!I'm so bringing everybody here!!!","299":"Top rate dim sum! Congee of finest quality, shrimp dumpling fresh succulent, pork dumpling tasty delicious. Pricey, but well worth the quality!","300":"Imperial Treasure has always been my favourite place for some authentic Cantonese style congee. You may ask what do I mean by Canto style congee. The texture of congee will be smooth and silky with no trace of the rice grain. My favourite combi is plain congee + one serving of roasted duck. It's my comfort when I'm ill or having no appetite for whatever reason.However, if you would like to try their congee, you have to go before 8.30pm because it is often run out around the time.","301":"Food is good. We ordered Beijing duck and steam fish. \u00c2\u00a0However, they missed our \u00c2\u00a0order of fried rice and we waited for more than 40min after several reminders.","302":"My family & I always go there for yum char & brunch since 1990s. The food is yummy & fresh. We love their Dim Sum & their ala carte dishes such as egg white with dried scallop, crab meat, black vinegar & pepper, fresh fish, roasted meat & their soup. The queue is super long during daily lunch hours & can be frustrating after a long wait. Their prices are reasonable. Worth your calories.","303":"This is one of my favorite dim sum places. All of the dishes hold up - the har gao, custard buns, XLB, etc. Of the handful of times I've been they've been consistent with everything, and I haven't had any dishes I would call a true weakness. Everything is really quite good, and the bill came out to ~$25 a head for a solid amount of food. The dining environment is nice. Service could be better - but this holds true of 90% of restaurants in Singapore. Also the location is convenient, and if there is a wait you can pass the time in the mall and not be forced to sit around waiting in front.","304":"The five stars are for Nico. He is an example of what good hospitality is about. This restaurant is lucky to have hired someone of his caliber. If I am the owner, I would put Nico in-charge and oversee staff training.","305":"I'm willing to say that Katanashi is one of the better restaurants in touristy Boat Quay. Also, I always see a group of Japanese people here, so I'm pretty sure this joint is legit!I remember coming here the first time for a UYE that Cindy Q.* set up many moons ago. This place has come a long way since then. They've expanded their food offerings, and I'm willing to overlook their Japanese English descriptions and the occasional misspellings on the menu as the food is pretty solid. The last time I went, I started with the tuna \"tar tar\" (sic) which was a creamy mixture with some avocado. I know it sounds as interesting as a double decker couch (Lego movie, anyone?) but shiok it was! For mains, Miguel and I are fans of the salmon rice that they serve in a heated clay pot. Before they serve it to you, they throw in a tablespoon of butter in the center of the bowl, then mix it up with some raw salmon. I think it's fairly priced for $19.We were still able to walk in without a reservation on a Friday evening, but it was almost full by around 8 PM. I'd definitely reserve if you're a group of 4 or more. Order all of the fried goodness and enjoy it over a cold Asahi. A great place to grab some grub before the club!*CORRECTION: My initial post mentioned Marcus L. as the organizer of this UYE, when in fact it was Cindy Q. Gotta give credit where credit is due. Thanks to Nik T. for the correction!","306":"I'm always a big fan of places that have a nice atmosphere. The staff here was super friendly and helpful. The service made me feel like I was in Japan. \u00c2\u00a0The beer was reasonable and so its definitely a nice spot for a drink. They had a nice menu of different dishes. Kind of a cross between an izakaya and tapas. \u00c2\u00a0But I'd say the food was all of good quality and they had an interesting menu. It wasnt just Suishi\/yakitori. \u00c2\u00a0 It wasnt TOP quality or something but reasonably priced and enjoyable. \u00c2\u00a0Its a fun\/lively spot. Nice atmosphere for a casual and fun evening. Its a nice spot for a date or just to hang out with friends. \u00c2\u00a0I'll be back for sure.","307":"I love izakayas and Katanashi does it right. Easy, fun, loud, fried food and yummy drinks. Perfect for happy hour or a chill weekend.The salted sake was kinda odd but really drinkable. Then we had the butter Mochi, beef carpaccio, salmon yukke, tuna tartare, fish cake stuffed with cheese and a mentaiko dip and the 'kfc' fried chick. All fab. Very unhealthy. But you know what you're in for. \u00c2\u00a0The clear winner was the salmon yukke. A soft boiled egg with an awesome runny yolk sat on top of sliced fresh salmon. Drizzled with some ponzu sauce and lady finger bits and seaweed, we dipped almost everything in the leftover sauce. Licked it up. I wanted to lick up the mentaiko dip too but stopped myself. Now I'm not sure why. It was absolutely yummy. Salty and tasty with little bits that you bite into. Then there was the beef. Not as raw as I would like but totally tasty and tender too. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Mochi in butter broth. Just too much chewing needed. It had the texture of an agadashi tofu until you start chewing and then it becomes gummy. Eeks! So only if you like salty gum. A clear winner for me. I'll definitely be back for more. Especially the carbonara udon that I didn't get to try!","308":"Cheery quick service, I like having lunch here. Its good, simple, includes salad and miso soup..all for $12. They do a good karaage and tebasaki. I love the salty powder and tangy sauce for the tebasaki which is $1.50 a piece.I like that they are flexible to give me the sashimi bowl with all salmon instead of tuna. And quite often they will have a daily special. I've brought many different people there for a quick catchup lunch as you can have a conversation, get willing service, take your time to eat since the food came quick and the funny part is thereafter, I often walk in with someone else and see someone I had brought before bringing someone else for lunch!It works for a regular stop in this busy raffles place area. $2.50 at lunch gets you a huge glass of housemade lime juice!I haven't played but I've seen someone playing the edamame game. Basically if you order edamame, you have to play scissors paper stone with the server. If you win you can grab a handful of edamame from the basket with all 5 fingers. If you lose, you can only use 3. But I saw an expatriate lady who lost..and the staff very nicely gave her a second chance. She still lost but she grabbed a lot of edamame with 3 fingers anyway..so it seems like a good and fun deal to me!Today they had a negitoro special, also for $12. The wasabi here looks like a mix of fresh and powdered and chef is always happy to give more as requested.The staff all recognise me now so even without me asking, they will prompt me \"Extra vegetables?\" Very nice touch.","309":"$12nett set lunch, what's there not to love! A good variety of about 8 types of rice bowls from the regular chicken don to more interesting ones with raw salmon and tuna, not forgetting the eel! You know that these folks are serious about offering you a good value lunch as it's not just the run of the mill type rice bowls that offered. Feeling bored and wanna get creative, grab a marker and doodle on their wet napkin wrappers. Overall an enjoyable lunch place with good value and if you fancy a view of the Singapore River, ask for a seat at the alfresco area!","310":"Was thinking of bringing the Girl to somewhere Japanese but not selling ramen. Searched on Yelp, and discovered this place. Here's my review (taste is in point 3)1. The atmosphere is nice and really casual. As some of the reviews have mentioned, if you do a reservation they will write a simple greeting card for you. And the wet towels they provide are also hand decorated. The effort to personalize your meal is notable, and I applaud it. This act certainly stands out from most restaurants.2. This restaurant has a lot of emphasis on your personal interaction with your food. I got an unagi \"rice bowl\" and the Girl got a salmon \"rice bowl\", and we were supposed to mix the rice with the butter and soft boiled egg a la Pepper Lunch. And another customer came and they ordered Green Peas, and there was a \"challenge\" by the staff in which the customer was given 1 chance to grab as much green peas with 1 hand as his dish. Such interaction certainly makes your visit more memorable, and probably makes the food taste better.3. Now for the food proper. I got the Unagi Meshi ($19.80), and mixed the rice myself. Considering the price, the piece of unagi in my stone bowl is ok-ish in size - it's about palm size. Nonetheless, it was marinated well and had a good texture! (I'm a fan of teriyaki unagi) the rice was nice, soft and not too sticky (there was butter in the rice so that could have helped). The only point is the rice crust that forms from the rice being stuck on the hot stone bowl, but that can't really be helped. I also ordered the Masuzake ($9.80), which gave me 180ml of Sake. It is served in an wooden box and a \"shot glass\" (you probably would see it in other reviews), and definitely eye catching. However though, it's not as strong \"alcoholic-ally\" sake as I expected it to be. So it'll be good for those who haven't tried sake before. But for sake lovers this sake might, in my limited opinion, not provide enough punch (that burning sensation down the throat). Nonetheless, the sake was pleasant and very nice to drink down!Overall, I would bring my friends along to try this place due to the interesting interactions that they can get. Price wise... Considering it's right at Boat Quay, it's not too bad. Good place as a date too! But the reason for 4 stars is, the food is not that impressive that would leave a lasting impression in me.","311":"Came for dinner and I think I will stick to lunch.The dinner menu is small and there are some good dishes but also some misses. The dishes are generally too sweet for me.Nothing spectacular and there are too many other choices around.","312":"\"Are you ready, customer leaving!\"Loud \"hai\" all round\"Arigatou Gozaimasu\"Follows the string of Japanese goodbyes and thanks echoing all around the tiny restaurant. The welcome shouts are equally enthusiastic.Amazing new find along boat quay that just opened in Aug 2012. It is actually a Japanese tapas bar but it serves up an affordable albeit small lunch menu on weekdays and Saturdays. $12 for various dons that comes with salad, miso soup and pickles.I wanted something skinny so I asked for maguro don. The menu is actually tuna and salmon but I requested for only tuna and it was graciously agreed.Rice was nicely seasoned sushi rice and served slightly warm. I love warm sushi rice and it is hard to find a place here where they serve nigiri sushi on warm rice like in Japan. For $12, I am a happy luncher. Plus if work allows you to get drunk at lunch, beer is $5 for a half pint at lunch.Service is brilliant, exactly what you expect of a typical izakaya. All smiles and Japanese hospitality.Can't wait to be back to try their full restaurant menu and all the sakes!","313":"I tend to avoid Boat Quay, but this cute restaurant toward the end of Boat Quay near Absinthe has solid Japanese food for good value. \u00c2\u00a0I like the sashimi for lunch which is $12. \u00c2\u00a0They have a bunch of other set lunch options that sound good; they avoid the strictly trite and boring Americanized Japanese food options.Service is polite and efficient. \u00c2\u00a0A big plus for me is that they amply provide some things you take for granted until you live in Singapore: crisp, chilled water without ice that is refilled without your having to ask and wet napkins (individually labeled) as well as regular-strength dry napkins provided at the table.","314":"Consistently delicious dishes from agedashi dofu, sashimi salads, sake poured uniquely in a wooden box cup and many other tasty things. Everyone in our group enjoyed the evening and attentive service. Great value too. Will definitely be back!","315":"Awesome place for lunch. Limited menu at lunch with mostly Japanese rice dishes (xxx Don). Delicious, it's a most try if you're in the area at lunch time. Pork Kakuni-Don and Salmon Yukke-Don were done very nice. Miso soup was among the best in S'pore. Cant go wrong with Asahi Black.","316":"This is one of the places in Boat Quay near my yoga place that I enjoy going. Usually I only care about the food, and the ambience is nothing that I am very particular about, but there is something about the chorusy and warm japanese staff and the cute menu that just draws you in, and you feel very welcome and comfortable. I enjoy the variety of food dishes available here, they have small bites and moderate portion dishes right up to rice and noodle dishes, so you can go regardless of how hungry you are. I love their fried chicken, the batter is sweet and crunchy and the meat is tender inside. Plus, I like it that you can order per pc so you don't feel like such a pig. I like the sashimi salad as well, for $8.70, I think the portion and quality of fish is pretty good. The other item on the menu I really love is the salmon butter rice. They cook the salmon, butter and rice together with mentaiko (cod roe) right in front of you in a sizzling hot bowl, and I loveeeee the flavor of the rice. All topped off with a pint of ice cold Sapporo, and I am \u00c2\u00a0a happy girl. :D","317":"My hostess Andrea was very professional and provided \u00c2\u00a0superior customer service! Although the wait was a little long, she always checked in with us to make sure our needs were met!! We will definitely come back and appreciate her pleasant attitude and professional demeanor. Keep up the excellent standards!","318":"My favorite Bistro & Oyster bar in Singapore, excellent service and delicious food, not as pricey as LAVO located inside Marina Bay Sands resort.I had brunch here on Saturday and also was honored to meet Chef Jonathan despite his busy schedule during service. \u00c2\u00a0All of the staff were so attentive and friendly, it made us feel like we were getting a Red carpet treatment, even though it was just a regular day for the workers there.We had an oyster platter, DB original burger, squid ink pasta, Brussel Sprouts & mushrooms. \u00c2\u00a0Also some champagne and mixed drinks that weren't on the menu. \u00c2\u00a0They have an excellent wine list and dessert menu. \u00c2\u00a0I also had some freshly made madeleines, molten chocolate cake and baked Alaskan for dessert.I made an early reservation for brunch at 11am, it wasn't that crowded but after my oysters came it started to get busy. \u00c2\u00a0We had Rain serving us, Ace was the bartender, Balthazar was the GM as well as Olivia and everyone else working. \u00c2\u00a0I'll have to say that this place has unsurpassed service and excellent food. \u00c2\u00a0Shall definitely be back, it's one of the busier and best places to eat in Marina Bay Sands.","319":"This place is conveniently located inside a huge shopping mall. It has a three consecutive brunch selection that's modestly priced. The food and customer service here was excellent! I definitely recommend it!","320":"Service is good , we arrived aft 1030pm for supper . Staff were good to let us sit in as they close around 1145pm I think . Like the shrimp cocktail , escargots & broccoli . Brussel sprouts were a little hard to chew . Overall the food & service are good.","321":"Love, love, love it!First of all the service: FANTASTIC! Every friggin' person at DB Bistro was on point: the bartender, the hostess, the server bringing my food, the manager: all of them were friendly, chatty, pro-active and helpful. Take note, all other restaurants: this is how it should be! I have noticed that often restaurants serve subpar dishes during restaurant week, not DB Bistro! The dishes were also listed on their regular menu and were just great. I've said it before and I will say it again: simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication! I love innovation but a classic is often a classic for a reason and when it is executed well, it is hard to beat. I started with the Kale Caesar Salad: I will definitely be back for this, it was one of the best salads I had in Singapore. The dressing was in perfect ratio to the salad and the anchovies gave it that typical Caesar flavor. \u00c2\u00a0The slow-cooked salmon showed great skill, in my opinion it was cooked just right! The dessert was another hit: the Molten Chocolate cake with the salted caramel sauce was pure indulgence.And this is not where the praise stops: the cocktail, recommended by the bartender, was simply amazing! I guess the only negative thing I can say about DB Bistro is that I ate way too much and that this experience spoiled many other restaurants for me as it will be hard to find somewhere in Singapore which matches the service and food of DB Bistro.In short: Awesome food, awesome service... they'll see me back at DB Bistro.","322":"After a show at the theatre we decided dinner was in order. First time at the bistro. The burgers are really good. Juicy and flavorful. Will definitely come back.","323":"Really wanted to like this place better. The Boulud name raised my expectations so it could only disappoint from there...which it unfortunately did. Whilst service was prompt and ninja-like, and ambience was very nice, the all-important food was a major let down. Especially considering we ordered the signature dish!We had: a DB burger and salmon tartare to share as we had only eaten brunch 90mins before. The DB burger was ordered medium but came out VERY pink. The foie gras inside was barely noticeable and made zero impact or difference to the burger. Whilst the texture of the burger was good, it was woefully under-seasoned and thus lacked any flavour. More salt would've probably helped bring out the flavour of the quality beef. A few miserable slivers of onion (for $50 a burger couldn't they have at least caramelised them?) and lettuce were scattered inside, along with a smear of mustard and ketchup. The parmesan bun was also totally underwhelming. $44++ is massively overpriced for a burger that would've been beaten in a blind taste test by Shake Shack or Omakase. On the plus side, the chips \/ French fries were excellent! Salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the $22++ ...portion essentially what you'd get if it was served in a martini glass. Again under seasoned and lacking any real character. Even the bread basket they served us was disappointing, with bread that had the texture of being cut and out in the air for a few hours. Overall for what was essentially a meal for one, we paid $77 and didn't even order a drink. Don't be sucked in by the celebrity name, the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect.","324":"Over the past couple of year, I have been to DB Bistro 5 or 6 times, and it's become one of my favorite places in SG, even though it's in a mall. \u00c2\u00a0The menu is French American with some classics, lots of seafood and burgers. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps one of their most famous dish is the Original db burger, which is made from short ribs and foie gras. \u00c2\u00a0It sounds totally decadent and at $45, it's the most expensive burger I've had in my life. \u00c2\u00a0But the short rib - foie gras combo was not working for me, even though I love both separately. \u00c2\u00a0A better choice is the Yankee burger which is exactly what a great burger should be like. \u00c2\u00a0The other famous item is their seafood tower. \u00c2\u00a0Available in 3 sizes, we had the medium one which was basically good enough as a dinner for 2 people. \u00c2\u00a0Loved the lobster and oysters, and speaking of which, the oysters here are the best that I have had in Singapore - very fresh, full of briny juice, and a nice selection of both European and North American oysters. \u00c2\u00a0 The surprise hit for me was their steak. \u00c2\u00a0I had the NY Strip, and it was a better steak than most of the steak houses in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0OK, at $88, it's not that cheap, but it was perfectly cooked and very flavorful and tender. \u00c2\u00a0Would definitely order a steak again. \u00c2\u00a0Overall, it's a great place for some oysters and drinks as well as a full dinner, seafood or steaks or burgers.","325":"I am a big fan of Daniel Boulud's restaurants. \u00c2\u00a0I have been to almost all of his NYC restaurants and I have been to the Bar Boulud in London as well. \u00c2\u00a0So, I was excited to see a DB Bistro Moderne in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0I came here on a busy Saturday night and sat at the bar. \u00c2\u00a0The staff was friendly and welcoming, and I quickly had a cocktail and some bread in front of me. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the steak frites. \u00c2\u00a0Usually steak frites is a mid-grade hanger or skirt steak. \u00c2\u00a0At DB, it is USDA prime, imported from the USA, so it is the top quality beef you can get. \u00c2\u00a0The dish was served with frites and a mini wedge salad. \u00c2\u00a0The steak was a bit undercooked, but they quickly took it back and brought it up to where I wanted it temperature-wise. \u00c2\u00a0After all was corrected with the steak, I went on to enjoy the entire plate of food. \u00c2\u00a0Although a bit on the pricey side, it was an excellent dining experience.","326":"On Sunday, we had a quick pre theater lunch at DB Bistro Moderne. \u00c2\u00a0It's an elegant and comfortable dining room. \u00c2\u00a0Not liking the looks of the appetizer choices and not wanting dessert, we passed over the set brunch items and focused on the ala carte side of the menu. \u00c2\u00a0For a starter, we shared the large portion of Tuna Tartar ($34). \u00c2\u00a0Served with cucumber, mint yogurt and thin homemade chickpea crackers - the dish suffered from a spiciness and strong dressing \u00c2\u00a0that sadly overpowered the tuna. \u00c2\u00a0I've had this same sort of dish elsewhere and most places let the fresh tuna flavor take center stage. \u00c2\u00a0Luke's does an especially nice version using avocado. The chickpea crackers were not doing the trick so we asked for more of the complimentary sliced baguette bread to use in its place. For mains, we chose Burgers: I had the Yankee Burger with cheddar cheese and my friend chose the Frenchie Burger. \u00c2\u00a0The presentation of the tall burger and the condiments is really nice (see photo). The sirloin lacked enough seasoning to enhance the natural flavors of the high quality beef. (my friend had the same complaint). \u00c2\u00a0Although I requested medium well, my burger was served at medium - still very pink in side. \u00c2\u00a0I am always a little underwhelmed with the burgers here. \u00c2\u00a0On my last visit, I had the Original DB Burger and remember having the same issues with it.The Good: The Dining Room is elegant and comfortable. \u00c2\u00a0The Staff is friendly.The Bad: \u00c2\u00a0Tuna Tartar needs less seasoning. \u00c2\u00a0Burgers need more seasoning.The Verdict: I'm looking forward to returning again and exploring more of the menu.3.5 stars","327":"If you have never heard of Daniel Boulad you need to get your head out of your ass. \u00c2\u00a0Seriously, he is amazing, and DB Bistro certainly lives up to having his name on the place. When I first moved to Singapore, I wanted to take myself out to a nice place after my I closed my first deal at work, and knew there were some celebrity restaurants in the MBS. Being that I was flying solo for this dinner, I knew I wanted somewhere that I would feel comfortable sitting at the bar alone, and somewhere that had killer cocktails and amazing food. \u00c2\u00a0DB had it all. \u00c2\u00a0I was immediately sat at the bar, the bartender (I wish I could remember his name) was chatty but not annoying, and made his recommendations, and the service was excellent. \u00c2\u00a0I had the lychee martini, some killer oysters, the salmon and the molten chocolate cake. \u00c2\u00a0Everything was excellent. \u00c2\u00a0Since then, I've been back about 4 times, I take clients there, I took my friends who were visiting from the US and have gone back on my own. \u00c2\u00a0Each time the bartender remembers me and my name and always makes a point to say hello, which I think is a nice touch. \u00c2\u00a0I've had everything from their lobster to the steak to the pasta and everything is good. \u00c2\u00a0If you are looking for a special occasion place, date night, client dinner or lunch, or place to sit at the bar and enjoy some me time, DB Bistro is the place to be. P.S. (Don't skimp on the bread, it's delicious!)","328":"First, let me say that this is a reluctant four, \u00c2\u00a0I would rather it be a three, but the service and food were both of good quality.Party of two, Saturday night, made the day prior. The decor is understated elegance, comfortable, attractive. \u00c2\u00a0The tables are nicely spaced and the booths looked comfortable. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately, we were seated at a table that was directly in line with the traffic from the kitchen to the dishing room so it was bit uncomfortable. \u00c2\u00a0We has the steak tartare, frenchie burger, original db burger, fries, and for dessert durian souffl\u00c3\u00a9 and maccarons.The food quality was good, as expected. \u00c2\u00a0For the price, it was not as exceptional as expected. \u00c2\u00a0The tartare was good, but I've had better. \u00c2\u00a0The fries we under seasoned. \u00c2\u00a0The burgers were delicious and the portion was small. \u00c2\u00a0We shared everything and originally started with the frenchie, thinking it would be filling. \u00c2\u00a0The portion was small so we ordered the db burger. \u00c2\u00a0The patty was larger (after all, it is stuffed with short ribs and foie gras). \u00c2\u00a0Two things pushed this from a three to a four:Service: server Mira was outstanding and attentive. \u00c2\u00a0Kudos to the restaurant for having quality servers and kudos to Mira for caring.Dessert: the Durian souffl\u00c3\u00a9 was over the top delicious. \u00c2\u00a0Durian is such an odd fruit and forbidden in many places for the smell, so I was surprised to see it on the menu. \u00c2\u00a0Mira and I had a brief conversation about how they actually use real durian and the controversy around that.Th maccarons were also very good and surprisingly affordable (6 small for S$10). \u00c2\u00a0The best, of course, were the madelines served after the meal. \u00c2\u00a0These were heaven. \u00c2\u00a0Light, fluffy, lemony, warm, dusted with powdered sugar.All in all a good experience, but with so many choices for dining in Singapore, I doubt that I will return to this particular venue.","329":"Now I came here really wanting to love this place. And I loved some of the food but it did definitely fall short of expectations.First, let me say that the service here is excellent. Definitely the best I experienced in Singapore...and I sat at the bar.I ordered a burger and french onion soup to start. The French Onion Soup was very good, though quite pricey, but definitely the best french onion soup I ever had, unfortunately though that wasn't what \u00c2\u00a0I really wanted. I came here for the burger, and the reason dB Bistro Moderne is only getting three stars instead of four or five.The burger had quite a burnt tast, and I ordered medium. The beef didn't seem to be of a high quality, which is disappointing as I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on it. The bun was soaked and surprisingly depressing. If only they knew how to keep the bun dry. I ordered the Yankee Burger and really don't have anything positive to say about it. I'd take a Carl's Jr. Six Dollar burger over this any day of the week...and it's a third of the price. I really want to try this place again since the French Onion soup was so good and the bartender hooked me up with free Madeleine's, which were fresh and very buttery. Next time I'm in Singapore I'll be back here, and hopefully I get more of the French Onion Soup, awesome Madeleines and great service, and less of the horribly overrated disgusting burger.","330":"This is a review of a dinner date at DB Bistro Moderne in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.The ambiance is modern with touches of the classic. \u00c2\u00a0I do like the kitchen behind the frosted glass. \u00c2\u00a0It is a nice comfortable room. \u00c2\u00a0I think its great that the tables are not so very close together.tinyurl.com\/c3ss58jThe service was extremely good. \u00c2\u00a0They were attentive throughout the meal. \u00c2\u00a0The staff was friendly, polite, and professional.The food ranged from good to exceptional.Complimentary Bread - For me, this was the weakest part of the meal. \u00c2\u00a0There were three kinds of bread. \u00c2\u00a0But I did not find any of them particularly interesting.tinyurl.com\/c5lhsd7Steak Tartare (Cornichons, Capers, Parsley, Baby Romaine, Grilled Country Bread) - This was my date's selection for a appetizer. \u00c2\u00a0I tried it and thought it was very good. \u00c2\u00a0It was tender and oh so flavourful. \u00c2\u00a0Truth be told, while I eat it relatively often, Steak Tartare is not my favourite dish. \u00c2\u00a0But this was very good. \u00c2\u00a0As with most of the dishes, the presentation was quite nice.tinyurl.com\/bppfewdSan Daniel Prosciutto (Arugula, Toasted Country Bread) - i selected this dish as my starter. \u00c2\u00a0This was truly excellent prosciutto. \u00c2\u00a0This is living proof that great food starts with great ingredients. \u00c2\u00a0So simple, yet so wonderful.tinyurl.com\/cxpptrhThe Frenchie Burger (Beef Patty Topped with Confit Pork Belly Caramelized Onion, Morbier Cheese, Arugula, Cornichons, Served on a Black Pepper Bun)I selected DB Moderne so that I could try their burger. \u00c2\u00a0I could not order their signature burger. \u00c2\u00a0I no longer eat foie gras. \u00c2\u00a0I selected the Frenchie burger. \u00c2\u00a0This was the best burger I've eaten in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0It surpassed the burger at Omakase. But this really gets into the debate between diner style burgers and gourmet burgers. \u00c2\u00a0I think the Frenchie was smaller than I expected. \u00c2\u00a0But the ingredients were amazing and came together so well. \u00c2\u00a0It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. \u00c2\u00a0This allowed the flavour of the beef to shine through. \u00c2\u00a0The Morbier cheese is what took it over the top. \u00c2\u00a0It was such a great selection. I loved it.The fries were good but certainly not amazing.tinyurl.com\/bnemgtkDuck Confit (Savoy Cabbage, Olive Oil, Crushed Potatoes, Mustard Jus)My date selected the duck confit. \u00c2\u00a0This was not a surprise. \u00c2\u00a0I tried it and it was quite good. \u00c2\u00a0She really enjoyed in.tinyurl.com\/cyr7vyoDessert - For dessert, she ordered the profiteroles and I ordered the chocolate fondant. \u00c2\u00a0I tried both. \u00c2\u00a0They were both chocolate lovers' dreams. \u00c2\u00a0However, I preferred my chocolate fondant. It was just an explosion of chocolate.tinyurl.com\/c6dzyrqtinyurl.com\/cgvy2znSinister Americano - This was her cocktail.

Came out to Marina Bay Sands for the SG50 food festival. The event was packed (seemed to capacity) and soooo very hot. I lasted all of 15 minutes outside \u00c2\u00a0before I called it quits and decided to enter the MBS mall. Of course, the mall was packed too. Decided on French food for lunch, got in the queue for db Bistro, and after a ten minute wait...we were in. Looking over the menu I realized I was, duh, in a Daniel Boulud restaurant...oh, db! Score! Lovely dining room. Much more elegant and modern than a French Bistro but not stuffy. Another positive, although the restaurant was full, I was able to hold a conversation with my table mate with no problem. The staff was very efficient, our server very helpful. \u00c2\u00a0For such a busy day, our food came out rather quickly. That was a nice surprise.I started off with a db signature Bloody Mary, it's a meal! The drink included: a skewer of prawn, ham, pickled veggies, and a the all important stalk of celery.To go with the Bloody Mary, I ordered French fries with three dipping sauces. Yum. And a lovely chilled lobster salad. Taste was Meh. I should of stopped at the drink and fries because the salad was really boring. The person I was dining with ordered the New England casserole and he really enjoyed every bite. The casserole was loaded with: mussels, clams, shrimp, fennel sausage, and corn. And it came with two generous chunks of toasted garlic bread. So a score there.Three and a half stars. All in all, just an okay experience. I know, I know, it is a Daniel Boulud restaurant. But I am pretty sure he was nowhere in sight this Sunday afternoon. Other than a celebrity chef name and prices to match, there is nothing to compel me to return to this restaurant. At this price range, \u00c2\u00a0there are many more restaurants I would rather visit upon my return to the MBS mall.","332":"For the price, this should have rocked the casbah - db as they call it has a nice menu and serve a great duck. \u00c2\u00a0Another good place to get someone else to pay and buy some nice wines if you can't leave MBS. \u00c2\u00a0Had the lamb and duck confit - the duck was awesome with succulent, crispy skin and fall off the bone meat served on a bed of garbanzo \u00c2\u00a0beans with bacon - this was five star worthy! \u00c2\u00a0The lamb was cooked medium and pretty good; served with mint and a nice burre rouge. \u00c2\u00a0Wine is pricey but service is excellent!","333":"Four stars for the food! \u00c2\u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00c2\u00a0The salad was a little too salty but when we mentioned it, it was replaced without questions.Two stars for service and ambiance. \u00c2\u00a0Very slow service: \u00c2\u00a0We sat at the bar - the only people on one side for 15+ min before we got a glass of wine. \u00c2\u00a0Checked in an hour early for a dinner reservation and was told there would be a table in 10 min - it took almost an hour. \u00c2\u00a0Ordered a bottle of wine that the sommelier 10 min later told us they didnt have. \u00c2\u00a0Asked for 1 min to make a new decision - he didnt come back although we tried to wave him down several times. \u00c2\u00a0Finally got a bottle and had a glass but most of it we had to pour ourselves...In regards to the ambience, if you like to pay $500+ for a mean for two with a view to people walking in the shopping mall it may work for you. \u00c2\u00a0Not exactly what I had in mind for a Valentines Day dinner with my lady....","334":"It's a great deal having this French dinner at Sands. The restaurant is owned by a \u00c2\u00a0three star Michelin chef (which I just found out).

I emailed them about a reservation in the morning got a confimation within an hour! Who needs OpenTable?  \u00c2\u00a0 Flashy, but without comfort, someone let DB down on this decore design.

Very disappointed.Would have been one star but gave a second one due to a purse storage container next to the table.","343":"This place is amazing! \u00c2\u00a0In kind of a seedy area of Singapore but the have a basket to place your valuables in to evade the common pick pockets of the area. \u00c2\u00a0 The staff was excellent and very attentive to my needs. \u00c2\u00a0 I couldn't make up my mind between the chili crab or the white pepper crab and the waitress advised I go with both! \u00c2\u00a0 Lol. \u00c2\u00a0 I ordered the chili crab and the white pepper prawn, both were absolutely amazing! \u00c2\u00a0Highly recommend if you are looking for a great meal.","344":"As a tourist, of course I had to come to No Signboard Seafood Restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0Even before my trip, I looked up places on Yelp and TripAdvisor and knew I had to come here. \u00c2\u00a0I didn't know there were other locations and I'm glad I had locals to suggest and take me around and Yelp reviews to read, because I'm glad I went to the original location here in Geylang. \u00c2\u00a0Apparently the prices at the Geylang location are much more reasonable and they are less likely to jip you out of your hard earned cash here.Valet parking is available for $4. \u00c2\u00a0No signboard has mostly outdoor seating under plenty of fans, but it also has an indoor area towards the back left corner. \u00c2\u00a0At night though, it's not so bad outside (and I'm not a fan of Singapore weather at all).No Signboard isn't like your average food centers where a plate of food costs you $3-5. \u00c2\u00a0It's actually quite expensive. \u00c2\u00a0Like most established Singaporean restaurants, you can choose the size of your dishes here (S\/M\/L), but even the small sizes start at double digits. \u00c2\u00a0Also, as with many other restaurants, they do not provide napkins here. \u00c2\u00a0I've learned to bring wet wipes and napkins around with me everywhere I go now.Lime juice was okay - tastes like powdered lemonade from the states... not sure if it' anything worth trying.Food:1. Chili crab - must get, obviously. \u00c2\u00a0The meat was tender and fresh. \u00c2\u00a0The sauce was spicy for everyone, but not really spicy at all for me. \u00c2\u00a0Everyone was sweating, but I was fine, so it depends on your spice tolerance.2. Salt\/chili fried bullfrog - this was actually my favorite dish out of the bunch. \u00c2\u00a0Perfectly battered and crispy outside that was salty and a little bit spicy. \u00c2\u00a0SO GOOD3. Some \u00e6\u00b2\u00b9\u00e6\u009d\u00a1 cuttlefish thing - fried goodness4. Some sort of coconut-y fried prawn - no shells - delicious5. Eggplant - standard chinese eggplant dish, but you have to have your veggies!Anyway, make your way to the Geylang resty if you've got a chance.","345":"It has been years since we were here and I recall they do have a Chili Crab sauce that is rather different from the rest - better that is. \u00c2\u00a0After picking up me boy from Mandai on route back to Marine Parade thought the logical path would be Geylang Branch. \u00c2\u00a0Got to say service was extremely attentive and to the extend that it was a little a pushy as each staff tries hard to up-sell. \u00c2\u00a0And yes even the paper apron cost $0.60\/piece. \u00c2\u00a0The saddest part was that the Chili Crab Sauce came in as a little reddish as oppose to somewhat orangy\/brown? \u00c2\u00a0The worst is that at S$112 (before the ++) the crab just was not fresh. \u00c2\u00a0We basically ordered the same dishes as we did at Jumbo as a comparison and again both the Baby Kailan and Mee Goreng fell short. \u00c2\u00a0If you are looking for ambiance this is not the place to be. \u00c2\u00a0But seriously with this price best we head back to our fav - Jumbo East Coast where we NEVER EVER have a bad crab day in so many times we have been there through the years.","346":"Sorry No Signboard, we really, really, really wanted to love you, but it just wasn't meant to be! \u00c2\u00a0Blame it on all the local hawker centers. \u00c2\u00a0Why does their food have to be SO CHEAP and SO GOOD?!? \u00c2\u00a0We are forever ruined....Alas, I digress.... on to the review:Deep Fried Bullfrog Legs (5\/5) - Our favorite thing here, oddly enough! \u00c2\u00a0The meat was tender and plump, and the seasoning was spot on! \u00c2\u00a0Kinda tasted like sweet MSG haha, and we ain't mad at that! \u00c2\u00a0Does anyone know of a place in LA\/SD\/Orange County that serves this??? \u00c2\u00a0Please tell us!!!Chili Crab (2\/5) - Of course we had to order this. \u00c2\u00a0It's only advertised on every tourist marketing material in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0It's like going to the UK without trying the fish and chips (which I will forever regret!). \u00c2\u00a0Well, lesson learned. \u00c2\u00a0Or rather, not so much, as our mandatory quest for chili crab fell way short of expectations. \u00c2\u00a0To put it bluntly, it was like crab slathered in \u00c2\u00a0that tomato sardine sauce. \u00c2\u00a0Oh, how I wish I were kidding. \u00c2\u00a0Well.... \"the more you know\".... still glad to have given it a chance, albeit an expensive one. \u00c2\u00a0White Pepper Crab (2\/5) - I have a thing for white pepper, so I thought I would be all over this one, but really, this tasted of ONLY white pepper and corn starch! \u00c2\u00a0It was too much for me. \u00c2\u00a0Pass.Fried Bread Buns (2\/5) - First of all, after order two crab dishes drenched it sauce, it would have been nice if the rolls had been complementary, but heck, for a place that charges for napkins and sauce, I get it. \u00c2\u00a0The bread itself didn't have much flavor except for a hint of sweetness, and was dense and a bit dry in the middle. \u00c2\u00a0We used the bread to dip into our sauce but as mentioned previously, I wasn't too big of a fan of those so it bit of a loss. \u00c2\u00a0As we look back at our trip to Singapore, this restaurant was by far the most expensive, yet least enjoyable place we ate at. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps these flavors are more the acquired type, because we did not acquire to them very easily. \u00c2\u00a0And yes, they will nickle and dime you for every little thing that they can. \u00c2\u00a0Just be smart and bring your own waters and wet wipes, and don't eat anything extra you didn't order, including the peanuts and the side sauces.","347":"The food was great but the price seemed a bit too much for what was offered. I was left paying a lot for very little and sadly I was still hungry after leaving the restaurant.Coconut in the shell juice was $5. It was pretty small and considering how coconuts are pretty much a local produce I was expecting it to be cheaper than in the US.Oddly enough they also charge for napkins and towel...seriously?? For the prices you are charging, it should be included.So we ordered Abalone, Scallops, Chilli Crab, and Shrimp.Although as mentioned the food was great, it was hard to justify the prices they were asking for.Scallops were sliced in half to give the impression that \u00c2\u00a0a lot of scallops were actually served in the dish. This is the same tactic where in Viet cuisine, when you ask for meat balls in your noodle soup, they just give you one meat ball and cut it into four pieces.The Chilli crab was good but there was way too much sauce. The Shrimp sauce was pretty good they made a sweet butternut squash puree.Only come to place if you have a ton of money to fling because or else you'll be pretty hungry after realizing you didn't order enough.","348":"There are two No signboard restaurants and one with open seating, the other is more upscale. Everyone told us to go to this open seating one. Dress casually as you are going to eat messy chili crab. Price is very reasonable and you get a lot!! \u00c2\u00a0We got chili crab, fried rice, noodle dish and conch. Fried rice was quite good. \u00c2\u00a0It wasn't crowded at around 7pm but around 8pm, it was packed. Service is attentive and fast. Highly recommended.","349":"It's our first time in Singapore and we decided to try out seafood here since we heard Singapore is \u00c2\u00a0famous for it. \u00c2\u00a0My family decided to eat here thanks to reviews but it was super expensive for what you get.I am rating this place one star because our waiter, Ajao, got our order wrong. \u00c2\u00a0We asked for butter but she gave us white pepper which was too spicy for me and I wasnt able to eat the 400$ crab.  My whole family knew I didn't ask for the spicy but we didn't realize until after they started eating it. Ajao did not want to correct her own mistake. \u00c2\u00a0She told me that if I wanted to eat, I would need to buy another one. \u00c2\u00a0We asked if we can exchange the one she got wrong but she kept saying to buy another crab. \u00c2\u00a0 I just ended up not eating. My family isn't rich but we wanted to have a treat, and unfortunately our experience just ended up sour.","350":"2nd crab I got in SG and it's the white pepper crab, I normally like black pepper better but the ads in this place said it's famous for white pepper crab, so that's what i go with this time. I only order the crab + beer + rice. It was ok, i like the black pepper\/chili crab that i got from Jumbo better + it has A\/C!Maybe I would like their chili crab or black pepper crab better! But... until next time!In the hot summer, this place has no AC and only covers to keep you away from the heat, so choose wisely if you decided to come, probably better to come at night :)","351":"White pepper crab $80\/kg. Kind of pricey as Newport back in California you can feed a family of four for same price. The crab was pretty good. Reason for three stars is the service. Worst I've had in Singapore. Took forever to get our rice. Also I felt almost conned. If I hadn't read the reviews beforehand I wouldn't have known to not touch anything they put on the table. The waiters will put appetizers and wet wipes on the table without telling you it's not free. Thankfully we didn't eat anything so waiters took it away. They also try to upsell you on other entrees. Don't get suckered and just stick to the crab. Also their tea sucks. Costs $2 for Chinese tea and it was basically their version of a Lipton tea bag- bitter. Also they automatically charge 10% service to the bill, but service was the worst. Oh and other restaurants don't charge for service so that was not fun to find out.","352":"We originally went to Geylang to eat hokkian noodle in one of famous coffee shop, but unfortunately they were closed, So we end up went to this place. We know this is a \"hot spot\" for tourist and was expecting a good meal there. We were about to order the crab, but looking at its price, we turned it down. $85 for a crab its a big NO. So we order the other things, black pepper deer meat, drunken prawn, kangkong, and bamboo clam with ice tea and a barley. The good dishes were kangkoong and the clam. Other than that was disappointed us a lot. Drunken prawn was tasteless, the meat were so so, not so much flavor. \u00c2\u00a0Our bill was $130++ so disappointed for the taste and price. Not worth at all.","353":"Singaporean chili crab and black pepper crab. \u00c2\u00a0Come with at least four people so you can order more dishes. \u00c2\u00a0I've been told by friends that the level of spiciness can vary at this place and that we went on a high spicy night. \u00c2\u00a0It was definitely packing heat but bearable nonetheless. \u00c2\u00a0Everything else we got here was delicious including the morning glory, the cereal prawns, the Chinese New Year salad, the deep fried bread. \u00c2\u00a0That deep fried bread is a must get side if you're ordering the chili crab because you can dip it in the sauce. \u00c2\u00a0You could do that with rice too but then that would feel too healthy.They do charge for all the extras here including water, wet wipes, etc. \u00c2\u00a0Trust me, you'll need all those. \u00c2\u00a0While I have been told that there are many good chili crab restaurants in Singapore, you can't beat the outdoor ambiance here. \u00c2\u00a0It's not as raw as a hole-in-wall but it's so nice eating in the cool, warm breeze.","354":"The spicy crab is delicious and tasty. Come in the afternoon and before dinner because it is not crowded and you can sit in the air condition area. Enjoy the crab and don't care how ugly when you are fighting with the crab.","355":"I decided to check out No Signboard for my first chilli crab experience in Singapore. And my gosh, it was fantastic. Really, truly fantastic. I was super hungry, and ended up eating by myself. That being said, the smallest crab I could get was still huge. It took a bit of time to come out, but was well worth the wait - it was amazing. Juicy, moist, flavorful. Messy as heck, but worth every drip and stain.Mine was not spicy in the slightest. Later, I spoke to a local who told me it was probably because many Singaporeans assume white folks don't like spice. So, lesson learned - next time, ask for spicy, and be firm. Other than that, it was amazing.The place is not cheap, but is so worth it. I would return in a heartbeat.","356":"Excellent chilli-crab here - I prefer this over Jumbo. The sauce is spicy and flavorful, leaving you with a slight numbness (essence of mala). I'm a big fan of the mantou they serve as well.The dining area is outside with no AC so prepare to sweat.","357":"This little hawker's kitchen is a spin off of the original owner's place, the back story at misstamchiak.com\/mei-mei\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. I was flying in and out of Paya Lebar Air Base and had a bit of a wait one day. Some of the local techs were heading to a little place that was owned at the time by a woman named Kay Lee. It has since changed hands, but the food is still amazing! I had Peking Duck in Hong Kong years before and as a result swore off duck for life. Well, never say never. Having stood in line for damn near an hour I decided to go with the Peking Duck for some reason (most likely because everyone else was--peer pressure's a bitch). Totally changed my mind about duck. The sad part is I'm very hesitant to try it anywhere else, as I doubt anyone else's will come close. So, if however unlikely you're in the area, give this little lady's menu a try.","358":"Hawaiian style poke - rare to find in Singapore and delicious to eat. However, the price is really high and I probably wouldn't be back to eat without the entertainer 1 for 1 offer. Alakai is located along Neil road at the end of the Everton estate. A small humble and cozy eatery with enough seats to fill 20 people or so. The tuna and salmon are kept in the typical ice cream freezer like other poke shops. They don't really need to cook any hot food because most of the items are premade. Thai chili salmon - nice spicy flavor and came with mangoes. Rice was topped with Japanese fish flakes which are very tasty. Also comes with a small potato salad and leafy salad Soy sauce tuna - classic tuna with small potato and a leafy salad. Rice is also topped with Japanese fish flakes. Rice is delicious and fish and salad is fresh. The only drawback is that each dish costs $18.90 so it is difficult to justify going back for a meal. Much more affordable if you use the entertainer 1 for 1 coupon!","359":"Amazing dim sum. There are prawn dim sum not on the menu as they take a few minutes to do. So try everything. \u00c2\u00a0A friend brought me here and we tried the whole menu. \u00c2\u00a0All tasty find your favorite. \u00c2\u00a0I came back a second time in my own and it was just add good. \u00c2\u00a0First time was breakfast second time was lunch. \u00c2\u00a0I could eat this any time.","360":"I'd give this place a solid 3.5 stars. It's small absolutely no frills and cheap. So don't expect great things. That being said, it offers value for money meals. Some things on the menu are reliably good. The steamed chicken rice and spare ribs on rice are good for a meal for modest eaters. I like that they add wolfberries to the chicken for a touch of sweet and colour. The ribs are always tender and cooked just right. The prawn dumpling soup has generously stuffed dumplings livened with shredded black fungus and shrimp, crunchy goodness! And the soup is tasty without giving you an msg attack. The glutinous rice with chicken and sausage in lotus leaf is nicely made, and goes superbly with the chilli sauce. And the chilli sauce is the bomb. Made inhouse, it is larded through generously with superbly crispy garlic chips. Love love love that sauce! If they bottle it I would so buy it. The siew mai and char siew buns are also hearty and rustic which is part of their charm. If you know what to expect, this is a good place to pop by for quick cheap eats.","361":"Not impressed... The taste is just okay, small stall also... Won't go again for sure...","362":"I am certain that there is not a single Indian food restaurant I have given or even have considered giving a 5 star Yelp review to before. \u00c2\u00a0But with that, I am happy to say good things about Punjab Grill. \u00c2\u00a0Other reviews are correct, this is an expensive restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0It is located in Marina Bay Sands, it is nestled amongst the stores of the swanky shopping mall, it is in the tourist area of the bay. \u00c2\u00a0It almost goes without saying, the prices are obviously going to be higher. I am not going to lie...this place will set you back a few bucks. \u00c2\u00a0But I still would not take back my 5 star Yelp review, because we felt the customer service and the quality was absolutely there. \u00c2\u00a0But what do I know really. \u00c2\u00a0I am a white girl, from the Midwest of America (Indiana to be exact) and really only gage my Indian food by the quality of the take out from the corner food stahl down the street of wherever I am living. \u00c2\u00a0I say this only partially joking. \u00c2\u00a0I do like Indian food and I will eat it from the street stahl and the fine dining experience and know enough to know the difference. \u00c2\u00a0Even with that, I still give the Punjab Grill a 5 star on Yelp. My husband and I were there on a Monday night, so maybe the quiet Monday night setting set it up for better quality customer service. \u00c2\u00a0Regardless, we felt welcomed and waiting on hand and foot for the entire time we were there. \u00c2\u00a0The dining room space is unexpected, being appointed with a contemporary feel, out of the blue being more intimate than we anticipated, with lots of glass and mirrors and more tastefully done than we had foreseen. \u00c2\u00a0The setting almost does not feel like an Indian spot, but it was a nice touch to the ambiance of our experience. \u00c2\u00a0You could be dressed up or more business casual, the attire could run the gamut a bit. \u00c2\u00a0The ambiance is not stuffy and over the top in any way. \u00c2\u00a0There is a little chef hat next to each food item that is recommended by the chef, so we went with six items that all had the little chef hat (if you don't know what to order, order what the chef is guiding you towards - always a good rule of thumb!). \u00c2\u00a0For our first time here, it was a great way to taste what they considered their best items. \u00c2\u00a0We were not disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0From salmon tkka to Paneer Lababdar, we were savoring every bite. \u00c2\u00a0If I knew this was my last day on earth, I might request the Bharwaan Khumb Peshawari. \u00c2\u00a0No joke! \u00c2\u00a0It is that tasty....like mushroom\/cheese\/melty ecstasy really! \u00c2\u00a0Really really delicious and worth every penny! \u00c2\u00a0Temperatures, preparation and presentation was all spot on. \u00c2\u00a0I think this is not only my first 5 star Yelp review for an Indian restaurant, I know this is my first 5 star Yelp review in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0And although I know there will be more in time (I don't hand them out readily), I am thrilled to have experienced Punjab Grill and it was my first. \u00c2\u00a0We will happily be back.","363":"It's unfortunate (for the owners) that this is located at the relatively-lower-traffic end of the mall, for in my opinion this is one of the best North Indian restaurants in Singapore, in the same category as Rang Mahal, Yantra, and Song of India. The lamb dishes are especially succulent - be it the lamb chops or the Nalli biryani. Surprisingly, the breads are not so great. Proactive and knowledgeable service. Pricey (count on $80 per pax without booze) but worth it.","364":"Delicious Indian food with multiple courses. This upscale restaurant is family friendly. Loved the service and quality of food. It is expensive but we enjoyed the splurge.","365":"This was the most tasteless, overly priced, Indian food we ever had. \u00c2\u00a0 For a pricetag of ~100$ per person we expected to have a perfect experience. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately the food was tasteless. \u00c2\u00a0The Golgappa Platter (kind of Pani Puri) was overly spicy, the Chicken Tikka Masala sauce was thick, heavy and lack the creaminess and taste we expected. \u00c2\u00a0Overall, not the experience we were hoping for!","366":"We were vacationing in Singapore and celebrated our Wedding anniversary here. Unfortunately the worst dining experience we have had in a long time. There was negative vibe in the restaurant and the food was tasteless. The staff was clueless about the food and was not trained well for the price tag restaurant carries. The manager was busy talking to some personal guests and did not ensure quality of the food and the service. Also, when asked to pack some leftover food for our 5 old who did not eat (jet lagged), the manager resisted and engaged in cheap, derogatory conversation.Avoid this restaurant, we visited few other restaurants which offered far better food and much more friendlier staff.","367":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. It is fairly priced, and the chefs menu for three people with beer and tips was only 470 SGD. Perfect seasoning. A lot of flavor without being to spicy. Highly recommended.","368":"Really sad service . Food was decent . Sat around several uncleant tables . Attitude through the roof . Do your self a favor and spare your self the sad service and rip off the wallet","369":"Very over priced. Ac by the wall tables unbearable. The curry dishes were so heavy on butter they were almost inedible. You can tell by how quickly they change color on the top layer after 10 minutes. Sauces tried to. E different but unimaginative and bland. I would not go back. $500 for 4 people with a hugely overpriced wine. Skip.","370":"We reserved this place for 9pm and were there at 8:58pm sharp. After being ignored for 15 minutes at the entrance, we tried to walk in and see if they notice us which is when we got our table.We ordered a 5 course veg and a 5 course non veg degustation menu. We were very excited to visit this place but the ambience appeared bit disappointing. It seems they haven't cleaned the glasses for ages.Our disappointment reached another level when food started coming in. I think we made a big mistake coming here given that there are other good indian restaurants around here in Singapore. The only thing we liked was the sorbet after starters which was supposed to clear your throat. Not to mention their service is way too slow to be acceptable. If you have made this far reading this review, I really hope that if you go there you really know what you are wasting your money, time and calories on.","371":"Fantastic place! The best Indian fine dining restaurant in Singapore. Great staff- friendly and customer oriented and some incredibly good tasting Indian food","372":"There are a lot of Indian restaurants in Singapore but this one really stands out for me the food is amazing the service is perfect. \u00c2\u00a0As a restaurant located in a mall it really shines and once your in you forget about the hustle and bussel going around outside. \u00c2\u00a0My only complaint is I do not get there often enough.","373":"Excellent service and solid Indian food. \u00c2\u00a0High end fine dining worth the bill attached to it. \u00c2\u00a0If you are an amateur Indian cuisine explorer the Punjab Grill vs a solid mid-price Indian restaurants make no difference. \u00c2\u00a0The crowd has mainly Indian which is a positive and the overall taste and thoughtfulness to the menu is there. \u00c2\u00a0They were also grate with any dietary restrictions.Recommended for date nights to impress.","374":"The Punjabi grill is an amazing restaurant. We ended up going to this place by chance but were so glad we did. Let's start with the ambience. the lighting was perfect and our host greeted us enthusiastically and happily. We especially loved the decorations on the walls and the amazing chandeliers. Now to the food, we ordered the power lunch which we thought was expensive at 40 bucks a plate but it turned out to be one of the best meals we've had in quite some time. They give you three starters to start with. One paneer that melts in your mouth, one sabudana vada, and one kathi roll. All were good. They also give you an aloo bonda on a curved fork. All of this was topped off with a pineapple sorbet to Cleanse the palette. The main course was three vegetable dishes rice and naan. One of these dishes was a paneer dish. It was simply out of this world. There was also a dum aloo dish, it was tasty and spicy. The final dish was a five daal dish. Good but unremarkable. the rice was hot and fluffy. \u00c2\u00a0The naan was well made and soft. The dessert was again three separate dishes - gulab jamun, kheer, and raspberry chocolate cheesecake. Amazing, amazing, amazing! My husband still cant shut up about the amazing compressed napkin. They put a mint in front of you, pour some water on it and turn it into a marshmallow. \u00c2\u00a0Before you know it its rolling out into a scented wet towel to wipe your hands with. The entire show is pretty epic. All in all a five star experience, no doubt about it.","375":"Ok so i admit we used a G****** coupon for this Saturday lunch but after our visit today \u00c2\u00a0we will become regulars when in this part of the city. We had the fixed four course lunch menu. One vegetarian one non-vegetarian. Both were outstanding. Each of the dishes had some heat but each had its own distinctive flavor. The little appetizer and palate cleansers were a surprise and no, they did not count as any of the courses. Service was superb. Attentive without the feeling of hovering at your shoulder. The restaurant was also full at 1pm on a Saturday which says a lot for lunch in that part of the city at the weekend.","376":"This is restaurant week and Punjab Grill was the first place I wanted to eat. \u00c2\u00a0I don't remember how this restaurant got on to my to-do list but it did and under further scrutiny it stayed there because it seemed to be a well regarded celebrity chef establishment. \u00c2\u00a0Guess what, it was downright mouthwateringly good. \u00c2\u00a0The following meal is just the set menu for RW but I think its a good indicator of how delicious everything is.Even though this restaurant is in the basement of the Marina Bay Sands the ambiance is very clean, calm, and modern. \u00c2\u00a0I especially liked the spice decorations. \u00c2\u00a0Our meal started with an amuse-bouche fritter and some poppadum. \u00c2\u00a0Their yogurt and mint sauces were unique.The meal progressed onto soup: basil and tomato shorba with truffle pygmy naan. \u00c2\u00a0It was fine, I don't really enjoy tomato soup, but there was a hint of some spice that made it fun and bearable. \u00c2\u00a0Our appetizers were very nice chicken and salmon tikka and then a lamb kebab. WOW. I haven't had fish that good in a while.For the main we had rice with grilled trava fish in a mustard sauce, lamb in \u00c2\u00a0nice gravy, rice, and dal. \u00c2\u00a0We got extra of the dal. \u00c2\u00a0They offered extra of everything for the main course but we were so full we couldn't even think about eating more meat. \u00c2\u00a0So just enough dal was put on our plates to clean up with the garlic naan. \u00c2\u00a0We love naan.We thought the meal ended with the desserts: Indian ice cream pistachio, rice pudding, and carrot halwa. \u00c2\u00a0They all tasted very traditional but were good.My one and only criticism is that the music is a bad piano laden karaoke soundtrack. It should be immediately replaced by a man in the corner playing a sitar. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not kidding. \u00c2\u00a0It might break with the modern esthetic of the place but it will be SO MUCH BETTER.Luckily for the meal and the end of this review the meal actually ended with a shot of Betel leave and ice cream. \u00c2\u00a0It was a super cool finish and very tasty. \u00c2\u00a0Much better than trying betel nut on its own.","377":"I was very disappointed with the food --- the quality was average and the service was like we were in a so-so restaurant. Given that Singapore has so many really good Indian restaurants, I'm surprised this earned its spot in MBS. There was no particular dish that stood out or worth mentioning. :( And I was appalled when during dinner, someone that looked like a dishwasher or delivery service walked right in the middle of the restaurant! Don't they have back service doors???","378":"Bad service. Incredible expensive. We got better and more food in little India for a 5th of the price. Don't understand how they get this rep...","379":"Indian restaurant known for fish head curry and other Indian curries.Tried both the fish head curry and chicken tikka masala here. They are both excellent - tasty, and a bit creamy in terms of style. Accompanying naan is warmed and has a homey tasteOverall, a safe bet for good Indian food.","380":"We had the fish head curry with naan. It's very runny like soup rather than on the thicker side like curry. It had a nice flavor but kinda felt like cioppino \u00c2\u00a0rather than Indian curry. The amount of fish meat in the head is quite generous but was a little overcooked. They also give a crap ton of broth. Like too much. Especially compared to the amount of meat. So most of it went to waste unfortunately. Overall, I probably won't be back.","381":"I decided to check out this place because it's listed as Michelin Bibi.I ordered the infamous fish head curry, small, and a mango lassi. I ordered chicken tikka misala to try. There's complimentary chips given when you sit down. The sauce and spice of the masala is on point and flavourful. It was prepared with white meat which I'm not a fan of so the dish overall is alright.The fish head curry comes in a big pot and the fish head, one head why it's a small serving, is drowning in sauce. I think that's how it's supposed to be. I liked the taste of the curry and the fish was easy to eat. I was able to take out the meat fine. Though I don't think having so much sauce was necessary.Also, protip, you pay at the entrance when you're done and about to leave. As a westerner I asked for the bill but it turns out, you do to the front.","382":"Wow, this place is very good. I tried multiple plates like: tikka masala, curry beef, lamb, and other. I also tried three types of naan: traditional, butter, and with some spices. Another spotlight of the place was the mango lassi, it was very delicious and fresh. I would definitely come back to this place for more!","383":"Muthu's was unreservedly recommended by two Indian colleagues who live in Singapore. We were not disappointed! The classic dish at this restaurant is fish head curry, so we ordered a 'small portion' to share between two. It was delicious. Highlights were the fish head curry sauce, the amazingly tender fish itself and the delightful basmati rice which you order separately. I definitely recommend this Singaporean institution.","384":"Service didn't exist. Simply an iPad\/tablet to order the food. Food was bland. Even the spicy lamb dish was not spicy at all. The naan was quite possibly the least fulfilling naan we've ever had. The bread was just flat and lifeless. No crispy brown bits and little bubbles of joy. Just flat white naan. This place shows up on Google as top 10 naans in Singapore! Bullsh%t! Don't bother. Never even got asked what we thought of the food. Really poor show from the team.","385":"I wanted to love this place. And it started so well - the Tandoori Chicken was succulent and tender. The Masala Prawns followed in a similar fashion. The Fish Head Curry? It lacked a kick. You could taste a heavy tomato base, and it didnt have the spice or excitement you'd normally hope for.The service was efficient due to ipads for ordering - but you also got the sense, from rude waiters, that this was a substitute, rather than compliment, to human interaction.And for $34 each? You expect better.","386":"Good restaurant in Little India. I had the Bindi Masala which was fairly tasty but wasn't my favorite variation of this staple dish. The Ramala Roti was probably one of the best rotis I've had though -- very light. Papadam were brought out soon after seating, but with no dipping sauces.","387":"Heard so much about this place and finally tried it out yesterday while in Singapore and I tell you it was amazing. The food was great and you just can't say enough about this place. Service was top notch and Narayan was awesome. He took such good care of me and my family. You have to try this if you are ever in Singapore.","388":"Muthu Curry was the place that the Folks insisted on visiting when I said I wanted to have some delicious curry fish head. It's been more than a decade since I last visited Muthu and I had long forgotten the taste. Indeed, the signature South Indian style Curry Fish head ($22\/$27\/$32) that has secured numerous accolades differed from the Chinese fish head curry in many ways. The colour was intense red instead of yellowish. According to the Folks, this kind of curry uses less coconut milk, so it was less creamy but the gravy is still rich because of the heavy spices rather than curry powder. There were no sight of brinjals, cabbage or tomatoes but ladyfingers and the piquant pineapple slices. Those who are adverse to spicy food will be able to handle this pot easily as the curry is NOT spicy at all. No sweat.We all love the gravy and could ladle it non-stop onto the fragrant Dum Bryani ($4\/head) or white rice ($3\/head), though the fish was not too fresh that day. If the menu looks Greek to those who seldom have Indian food, there is also display counter where one can pick whatever food that looks tantalizing. The Mysore mutton ($11) was too tough but the Tandoori Chicken (below), chicken marinated in yoghurt, was smoky and flavorful. As a big fan of Indian Vegetarian food, I love all sorts of creamy paneers and Daals. But I decided to ditch the gravy laden veggies and try something new. The Vegetable Sheesh Kebab $9 was a mistake because it turned out to be dry rolls of mixed vegetable potato pattie, though the accompanying green sauce was zingy enough to perk the tastebuds. But the Gobi Manchurian ($9) turned out to be one of my favourite dish that night. Didn't know that it was actually an Indian Chinese fusion dish. Perhaps the Chinese aspect comes from the cooking method--coating the cauliflowers in batter and deep fry just like Sweet and Sour Fish. They are later sauteed in soy and chilli sauce. Not spicy but super sour.Another first try is the Peshwari Naan ($5), a sweet naan in coated with almonds. The Folks commented it was strange to have sweet naan with savoury curry but I thought it was a nice balance to offset all the savoury food. So I rejoiced when I could have the entire naan all myself ( the rest took charge of the remaining rice;)As usual, free flow pappadum, free flow of side vegetables (yellow cabbage was ok but the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed long beans were too salty). Together with the fragrant non-greasy Bryani rice, it was a great satisfying dinner. Even Ah Ma nods in agreement.","389":"Now, this review is solely on the food. We came a little after lunchtime and the service was slacking for an almost empty place. However, food was great. We had a few dishes - the fish cutlet, the fish roe and the fish head curry. Fish cutlets and fish roe were...meh..to say the least. But the fish head curry was nice and fresh. I devoured all the gloriousness of the fish's cheek and jaw and eyes! Yum! I loved the addition of pineapple in the curry; almost a palette cleanser. I'd say skip everything else and get the fish head curry. Worth it!","390":"OMG YUM!!!! Not only was the food good, but the service was great as well. I got the Mutha's Chicken Chuuka and it had a wonderful spicy taste to it. I will definitely be back for more of that!! Definitely get the mixed appetizer as well. I left so full that I needed to be rolled out of there. Lol. Their cheese naan is great also.","391":"I usually do not go to Muthu for the fish head curry because I and my wife cannot finish it and we don't want to be limited to trying one dish only :)I go here for the smaller dishes like the chicken tikka masala, chicken 65, tandoori chicken.What makes this different is that all their dishes come with a bit of spice that reminds me of how these dishes are cooked in India instead of the mellowed or 'Singaporeanized' recipes.Very reasonable pricing for food vs others in the vicinity along race course road.","392":"Never had Fish Head Curry a day in my life but came here to try it and it was amazing! The restaurant was nicely designed and had a great staff and of course a great menu. Would be ideal for a date, business meeting, or just an outing. The naan was good as was the Indian Chai. I will be returning to try more things.","393":"Best fish-head curry I've had.Best Indian food I've had in Singapore, hands-down!","394":"This outlet of Muthu's is probably the one that still tries to maintain the high standards it was once renowned for. The one at Dempsey is just a poor excuse to overcharge people for simple dishes. The fish head curry over here is still as good as it was when I had it as a little kid, while the rest of the dishes have not really been consistent.","395":"We visited Muthus on a Sunday night and visiting Little India on a Sunday is an experience in itself...! However, let's talk about the Muthu's experience shall we?! I have previously visited Samy's in Dempsey on a visit to Singapore last year and it has set a fairly high benchmark. Unfortunately Muthus, which also serves curries on a banana leaf, while decent, is definitely not on par with the likes of Samys.Had a mango lassi to drink which was delicious and I slurped it all up far too quickly. The complimentary bowl of poppadoms at the table was a nice touch but the stale soft ones at the bottom weren't! We tried their famous fish head curry, the almond chicken, a beef vindaloo, saag paneer and the garlic naans. The fish head curry was tasty but prepare to be poking around for some decent chunks of fish. The beef vindaloo was also quite delicious. I found the almond chicken quite boring, with bones in the chicken (I had naively assumed boneless) and the saag paneer very bland and tasteless. \u00c2\u00a0I had expected rich tastes of spinach and cottage cheese, instead the lukewarm dish lacked any flavour whatsoever. In fact most of their dishes were only warm rather than the steaming hot curries of my imaginations. \u00c2\u00a0Service was probably in the third quartile, i.e. below average. Quite hard to get their attention when we needed more rice\/naan. By which stage our curries were definitely approaching the cold stage. Restaurant is clean and modern, and they do much of their cooking at the kitchen situated in the middle of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a bad experience, but I wouldn't probably go back either given the host of other options in the city.","396":"Can't tell you much about the food, because I left after sitting there for 15 minutes without anybody bothering to take orders. I should have known from the start, because the tried to seat me at the worst table although the place es half empty.BTW I'm not the critical type of person regarding restaurants and service, but this was definitely too much.","397":"They used to be good in the past, but standards have fallen and prices have kept on rising. With so many other better and affordable Indian food available in the market right now, I'd say that only those die-hards and those that are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine in general would still continue to eat here. I cannot justify paying so much for food that is really mediocre and up till now, I've not managed to leave the place after dining, happy.","398":"This is an easy to locate indian restaurant. It is along Race course rd. There are a lot of other restaurants as well. I love their mutton and chicken briyani sets which come up to around $10 or more. They have a lot of varied food. Spicy and delicious. I often go there every 5 months once. To celebrate and to dine alone sometimes.","399":"I have been told that this restaurants' standards had dropped in the past 1-2 years, but I still wanted to try it with my family. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. We had fish head curry, the dish was quite disappointing. The fish was hard, over cooked, not fresh and had a hint of an off-putting fishy smell. The fish was placed on a big deep bowl with plenty curry sauce, but the strong curry spice couldn't cover the fishy smell. The fish head curry was so disappointing! When we told the waiter the fish was not fresh, he replied, the fish was cooked to order. My point is, cooking a fish that wasn't fresh in the first place doesnt make it any fresher! Another dish is the lamb dish. It was very chewy. Since they had a buffet in the afternoon that included this dish, I was wondering if they just gave us the leftovers. Additionally, one of my family members and I got bitten by a mosquito. My friend already made a reservation \u00c2\u00a0in this restaurant, and after my dinner I immediately told them to cancel it. This restaurant was a disappointment.","400":"Some tandoori chicken, curry, rice fresh bread and Tiger lager. \u00c2\u00a0Nice spice. \u00c2\u00a0Good service. \u00c2\u00a0If you are in the mood for some Indian food whilst in Singapore, this place is unlikely to disappoint. \u00c2\u00a0It was a great lunch stop.","401":"Muthu's curry was a random choice for a group of us feeling hungry after a bout of shopping in Little India. We were looking for an air-conditioned place serving decent Indian food along Race Course Rd.I had the naan with butter chicken and the chicken-65. Chicken-65 is something that you can find everywhere in India, it's fried chicken coated with spices. No complaints at all, my naan came piping hot and I devoured it with the scrumptious butter chicken in seconds. Their specialty is of course their curry, my friend had their curry chicken and I had a taste - its definitely far spicier than many indian curries that I've tried. Final verdict: Recommended for those who love their Indian food really hot and spicy!","402":"I like the mutton biryani topped with fish head curry. The tiger prawns look tempting, but they look better than they taste. Service is quite indifferent and the place is very busy.","403":"I've been a regular here for the past 2 years. Generally decent service if a bit rushed because they're so busy but good food and atmosphere...
