hawker center, we immediately saw sungei road laksa as a line had formed. After a small wait, we got out bowl of delicious laksa.The soup in the dish was delicious and had a nice coconut flavor to it. The noodles were also smooth and the protein went well with dish.Overall it was a good bowl of laksa for the price you pay. Would eat here again if I'm in Singapore again.","2":"Laksa is a popular Southeast Asia spicy noodle soup with rice noodle in coconut milk curry soup. I'm not a big fan of curry but had to try it out. It was good and definitely worth a try if you can handle some heat. Even though I don't like curry, I still enjoyed it. Sungei road seems to be the best but we also tried the laksa in the Colony buffet (in Ritz Carlton) and thought the quality is pretty similar but this laksa is a fraction of the price. $3 for a small bowl.","3":"Laska is not my thing and after trying this still not my thing. I love noodles and soup, but I prefer simpler and clear broth. Although I'm not a fan of this soup, I can see why it's popular with the flavor profile of curry, coconut and chili. \u00c2\u00a0Bowls are small, but good size. If you're from the Americas think of it as a small chicken bowl size or a bowl of soboro don. Noodles are cut, only utensils available are spoons. Which fits perfectly for every bite and easily able to get a spoonful of noodle and fish balls and cakes. $3SGD. How can you go wrong with something flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0If it was my kind of food, I would eat this again and again just like the locals. Don't be alarmed at the long line. \u00c2\u00a0They serve it rather quickly. \u00c2\u00a0It ain't no howlin rays kind of wait, if you're from LA.","4":"Laksa here is so good! Tasty and rich in flavor. Line is always long, but goes by pretty fast. Bowl is a bit small, but its not pricy either. Love the combination of the fish cake, cockles, creamy coconut curry milk broth spices and noodles - everything blended so well just slurp up all the liquid yumminess! Delicious and worth a visit!","5":"Sungei Road Laksa was one of the more popular laksa-selling places I found online. When I arrived, there was already a sizable line that had formed. After I got in line, another large wave of people appeared out of nowhere and the line pretty much doubled in size (the amount of people waiting here speaks to its popularity).The laksa was super cheap and looked delicious; HOWEVER, the portion size was extremely small. They do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl, but I didn't find this to be a problem at all. The coconut flavor was pretty strong, but after I finished my bowl, I found that the overall flavor was not as strong as I was expecting. I liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy. I thought that I would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl, but I was surprisingly content. That being said, I easily could have had another bowl.For me, Sungei Road Laksa was a delicious introduction to laksa (first time trying it!). Although the line here may deter some visitors, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area.","6":"The bowls of laksa at Sungei Road Laksa, located in a small hawker center, are small but packed with flavor! You can tell this place is popular just from the lanes they've set up to organize guests waiting in line, and for a cheap, uniform price of $3, you get a flavor-packed bowl of rice noodles in coconut milk curry broth, topped with fish cake, cockles, herbs, and chili paste on the side! Interestingly, they also have a big sign on their stall that says \"no chopsticks,\" and you're only given a spoon to eat the dish, ensuring that you slurp up all the liquidy goodness!","7":"Best Laksa of life! Extremely affordable; $3 for a small bowl. Broth made traditionally with charcoal. Creamy coconut milk paired with spices, herbs and spicy sambal together create a sublime bowl of laksa. I love the hint of freshness from raw clams. Sungei Road Laksa do not give out chopsticks but rather, pre-cut noodles so you can inhale it with a spoon. The flavour profile really changes with every bite; sambal, clam, herbs, ouff tofu. One of the best thing I ate in Singapore! I licked the bowl when no one is looking! Definitely worth traveling for!","8":"A little shop amongst 15~20 other little stands serving amazing authentic food. No frills, they're not there to entertain you. Walk up, tell them how many bowls of the delicious yellow soup you'd like, pay and pick up your food. No chopsticks provided at this shop which is kind of funny because you're eating noodles. But the spoon will force you to slurp up all the soup along with the noodle. Not a bad idea actually.This bowl is TINY especially compared to American standards. I could probably eat 3 of these alone. Each bowl is only $3, so luckily I could comfortably afford all three bowls. BUT I didn't. I wanted to save my stomach for all the other goodies around here!Fyi this was a tiny bit spicy.. just the way I like it. And there are little clams in there (so yummy!!!!) --in case you're allergic. Highly recommend!!!","9":"As soon as we landed in Singapore, we were planning our food adventure. The first stop was Sungei Road Laksa, which was conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of our Airbnb.We shared a bowl of this delicious soup and were tempted to get more but knew that we had many other things to try. I loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick.","10":"Laksa so good. There won't be a line if you come early. At $3 SGD, this is a steal. The broth was so creamy and delicious - I wish I had doubled down on the order. Definitely worth the visit!","11":"The laksa here is so good. And at $3 it really is a steal. It's located at a hawker stall. After reading the reviews about it being small, my wife and i ordered 3 between us. Seemed to be a good amount for breakfast. As other reviews mentioned there's no chopsticks. But since the noodles were cut up I didn't find this to be a problem at all.","12":"Overall great Laksa- love the small bowl portion size. I didnt enjoy the clams in it however and i picked them all out.

I like the renovated stall. You only have one option now. Strictly $3 per bowl. No upsize. I saw people order two bowls for themselves after they requested for large and was told only one size. It is not a big bowl but it can be filling, especially when you also order a drink. It is without chopsticks (also stated clearly at the stall - I think they got tired of people asking) like the original katong laksa in katong. It comes with just bean sprouts, sliced fish cake slivers and cockles. None of those fancy prawns, taupok or even crayfish in other versions. Mix the chili into the gravy to get the red gravy we are used to seeing. It is not that spicy. Now that I like cockles, this is the place for my fix. It is chockfull of it. The first time I tried it was over 10 years ago before the renovation and I was not that into it. Maybe because it was hot and muggy, plus I did not care for such a small bowl with simple ingredients then.","15":"Worth the hype and the trek! This seemingly humble bowl of $3 SD laksa is packed with a heavenly blend of sweet, sour, spicy and lots of umami....after one spoonful I already wanted another bowl!I arrived around 11AM and waited only about 10-15 minutes, building up my appetite as my eyes feasted on watching the aunties stirring and ladling big spoonfuls of soup over a charcoal stove. The soup is fills you with umami and fresh cockles and packed with strong flavors of chili and curry, all balanced out by sweet coconut milk which lightens the broth to be perfect. A noodle soup is good when you drink it to the last drop and that's exactly what it did.","16":"Good place to get decent LaksaRecommended, but with caveats (read on...)We were out shopping and in the mood for Laksa, and this place was highly recommended.Food:We kept it simple and ordered only Laksa (and Kueh Pie Tee from next door). The Laksa was flavorful, even if the gravy was a bit thin. It was available with cockles, which was disappointing since some places will happily substitute prawns. And they sell only one size, which I would call small. The Kueh Pie Tee was tasty, but with ground peanuts is not traditional Nonya style.Cost:At $3 for a bowl, the Laksa is an excellent value.Service: Good, the queue was quite long, but went quickly. The uncles were quick to clear away the bowls after.Atmosphere:This is a coffee shop (no aircon). Overall:If you're in the area and craving Laksa, it's definitely worth stopping here.","17":"The laksa here is definitely tasty and rich. The laksa gravy is the main character of the dish. I would give the taste of this dish 5 stars.However, I believe the service can be better. When I came here during one of the Saturdays, the staff was able a bit rude and impatient to us. On normal days, they are fine. I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for tasty and delicious laksa.","18":"Sungei Road Laksa is frequently patronised by my family as the laksa gravy is milky, rich and mildly spicy. Note that they won't give you any chopsticks nor a fork as you will only eat with the given spoon! The noodles are all cut into shorter lengths so you will have a easier time consuming it this goodness!The price is relatively high for a EXTREMELY small bowl of laksa.($3) But who cares if it's delicious!","19":"$3 SGD for a delicious bowl of laksa served the traditional way with no chopsticks. I came here at 10:30 in the morning and there was already a line with 3 people in front of me. With only one item being served and only one size, ordering was a breeze. When it's your turn, just let them know how many bowls when you're standing in the queue. Watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times. The bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake, and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl. Taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa I've had before was by no means on par with Sungei Road. The soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste, the complex blends that builds the curry, and finally the spiciness from the chili paste.Eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long, don't wear a white shirt by the way! The bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards.","20":"The food has been phenomenal Laksa was awesome, it was cheap yet heavy..","21":"When we got to this hawker center, we immediately saw sungei road laksa as a line had formed. After a small wait, we got out bowl of delicious laksa.The soup in the dish was delicious and had a nice coconut flavor to it. The noodles were also smooth and the protein went well with dish.Overall it was a good bowl of laksa for the price you pay. Would eat here again if I'm in Singapore again.","22":"Laksa is a popular Southeast Asia spicy noodle soup with rice noodle in coconut milk curry soup. I'm not a big fan of curry but had to try it out. It was good and definitely worth a try if you can handle some heat. Even though I don't like curry, I still enjoyed it. Sungei road seems to be the best but we also tried the laksa in the Colony buffet (in Ritz Carlton) and thought the quality is pretty similar but this laksa is a fraction of the price. $3 for a small bowl.","23":"Laska is not my thing and after trying this still not my thing. I love noodles and soup, but I prefer simpler and clear broth. Although I'm not a fan of this soup, I can see why it's popular with the flavor profile of curry, coconut and chili. \u00c2\u00a0Bowls are small, but good size. If you're from the Americas think of it as a small chicken bowl size or a bowl of soboro don. Noodles are cut, only utensils available are spoons. Which fits perfectly for every bite and easily able to get a spoonful of noodle and fish balls and cakes. $3SGD. How can you go wrong with something flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0If it was my kind of food, I would eat this again and again just like the locals. Don't be alarmed at the long line. \u00c2\u00a0They serve it rather quickly. \u00c2\u00a0It ain't no howlin rays kind of wait, if you're from LA.","24":"Laksa here is so good! Tasty and rich in flavor. Line is always long, but goes by pretty fast. Bowl is a bit small, but its not pricy either. Love the combination of the fish cake, cockles, creamy coconut curry milk broth spices and noodles - everything blended so well just slurp up all the liquid yumminess! Delicious and worth a visit!","25":"Sungei Road Laksa was one of the more popular laksa-selling places I found online. When I arrived, there was already a sizable line that had formed. After I got in line, another large wave of people appeared out of nowhere and the line pretty much doubled in size (the amount of people waiting here speaks to its popularity).The laksa was super cheap and looked delicious; HOWEVER, the portion size was extremely small. They do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl, but I didn't find this to be a problem at all. The coconut flavor was pretty strong, but after I finished my bowl, I found that the overall flavor was not as strong as I was expecting. I liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy. I thought that I would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl, but I was surprisingly content. That being said, I easily could have had another bowl.For me, Sungei Road Laksa was a delicious introduction to laksa (first time trying it!). Although the line here may deter some visitors, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area.","26":"The bowls of laksa at Sungei Road Laksa, located in a small hawker center, are small but packed with flavor! You can tell this place is popular just from the lanes they've set up to organize guests waiting in line, and for a cheap, uniform price of $3, you get a flavor-packed bowl of rice noodles in coconut milk curry broth, topped with fish cake, cockles, herbs, and chili paste on the side! Interestingly, they also have a big sign on their stall that says \"no chopsticks,\" and you're only given a spoon to eat the dish, ensuring that you slurp up all the liquidy goodness!","27":"Best Laksa of life! Extremely affordable; $3 for a small bowl. Broth made traditionally with charcoal. Creamy coconut milk paired with spices, herbs and spicy sambal together create a sublime bowl of laksa. I love the hint of freshness from raw clams. Sungei Road Laksa do not give out chopsticks but rather, pre-cut noodles so you can inhale it with a spoon. The flavour profile really changes with every bite; sambal, clam, herbs, ouff tofu. One of the best thing I ate in Singapore! I licked the bowl when no one is looking! Definitely worth traveling for!","28":"A little shop amongst 15~20 other little stands serving amazing authentic food. No frills, they're not there to entertain you. Walk up, tell them how many bowls of the delicious yellow soup you'd like, pay and pick up your food. No chopsticks provided at this shop which is kind of funny because you're eating noodles. But the spoon will force you to slurp up all the soup along with the noodle. Not a bad idea actually.This bowl is TINY especially compared to American standards. I could probably eat 3 of these alone. Each bowl is only $3, so luckily I could comfortably afford all three bowls. BUT I didn't. I wanted to save my stomach for all the other goodies around here!Fyi this was a tiny bit spicy.. just the way I like it. And there are little clams in there (so yummy!!!!) --in case you're allergic. Highly recommend!!!","29":"As soon as we landed in Singapore, we were planning our food adventure. The first stop was Sungei Road Laksa, which was conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of our Airbnb.We shared a bowl of this delicious soup and were tempted to get more but knew that we had many other things to try. I loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick.","30":"Laksa so good. There won't be a line if you come early. At $3 SGD, this is a steal. The broth was so creamy and delicious - I wish I had doubled down on the order. Definitely worth the visit!","31":"The laksa here is so good. And at $3 it really is a steal. It's located at a hawker stall. After reading the reviews about it being small, my wife and i ordered 3 between us. Seemed to be a good amount for breakfast. As other reviews mentioned there's no chopsticks. But since the noodles were cut up I didn't find this to be a problem at all.","32":"Overall great Laksa- love the small bowl portion size. I didnt enjoy the clams in it however and i picked them all out.

Just look at the sgd\/gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay, or that will satisfy ur belly. Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!! Happy hawking!!!","41":"Someone at the hotelWhere I am staying recommended this restaurant. After a walk in Chinatown we decided to come here. We got seated right away and we ordered the Alaska King Crab.1.3 kg ( half of the full crab ) about 200 SGD and we got the seafood noodles. The sauce for the Chili \u00c2\u00a0Alaska King crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what I was expecting.Service was also very disappointing, workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat. Felt like we were been hustled, peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table 2 SGD in the bill, bread rolls that I didn't even touch also put in the bill, at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it. I would not Recommend this place, way better other places in Singapore to have chili crabs \u00c2\u00a0.","42":"Jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs. My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs.","43":"Holy cow! Totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands. Waited all day to come try Jumbo Seafood for dinner and was so disappointed! The whole dining experience was meh. There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating. Nothing really wow'ed us, we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid. Honestly, every hawker stand we tried, the food was SO good! Being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip, we were slightly bitter and disappointed.","44":"A Singapore institution that never disappoints! \u00c2\u00a0Situated on the shores of the River, this beautiful setting in a warm Singapore evening watching the people cruise by.We started with a squid appetizer followed by Pepper Crab and Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Crab comes with amazing sauce that cannot be described. \u00c2\u00a0Perfect little dough balls for mopping up the extra sauce. \u00c2\u00a0Love this place.","45":"I am aware that Jumbo Seafood is a total tourist trap and that prices are high. That said, I was taken to a \"non-touristy\" chilli crab spot by someone who lived in Singapore previously and did not enjoy the crab at all. Since this was his first trip to Singapore, I figured why not go with Jumbo. I made a reservation for prime dinner time about 45 days in advance. You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy. So much fun. We ate in silence as we concentrated on getting all the crab meat out. I may have flung some crab onto the glass window next to where we were sitting. Oops!)-Fried buns (Perfect for soaking up the chilli sauce).-Cereal Prawns (Skip! Do not believe the hype, it was not worth it).We were in an out within an hour and were very satisfied with our seafood feast.","46":"Underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here. We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored.","47":"During my 3 days stay in Singapore in March of 2019, I cannot not try the Singapore Award Winning Chilly Crab here!! I was sooo excited to come, and I have to say, by far, it is the best crab I've ever had in my life!!The sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut. I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!! During the past 5 months, I have tried a couple of Malaysian and Chinese restaurants in the Northeast and haven't found anything that was close to this!! I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!! \u00c2\u00a0OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive. I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!","48":"Came for the chili crab and was NOT disappointed. This stuff is so good and a cant miss in Singapore. I had found jumbo seafood on a list of best chili crab and had that recommendation seconded by a local so I couldn't say no! One chili crab is about the right size for two people and do no miss the bao buns on the side to soak up all that delicious chili crab sauce. Also prepared go get messy digging in! We had just a side of broccoli with the crab and honestly were so stuffed we didn't need any other sides. The wait was long but they take your name and number and Clarke Quay is a great place to walk around, so just expect it to take a little time for your turn!","49":"Chili crab is excellent!! Their fried rice is one of the most well made fried rice I've ever had. Each grain is perfectly saut\u00c3\u00a9ed and not overly saucily or oily.","50":"I really don't get the hype. A single chili crab was 88 SGD, which is about $65. For that kind of money, I could go to an AYCE buffet in Vegas and get unlimited crab legs. The flavor is pretty mediocre too. We ordered pea sprouts, but they were the baby kind, not the tastier, more mature kind. And some sort of scallops in taro which I could have done without. Actually I could have done without the whole meal. There are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other -- make sure you go to the right one. Reservations recommended. This place gets busy.","51":"A must-visit for visitors to Singapore, Jumbo Seafood is the place to come for the classic Singaporean dish of chili crab! It's messy (wear a bib!), it's spicy, it's sweet--it actually reminds me of the classic Chinese tomato and egg dish (perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients)! The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp! Luckily, the crispy, sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal, even eaten on its own!","52":"Salted egg coated food. That's what this place is all about. My colleagues and I came here for dinner. None of us live here as it's super expensive to dine without expense account. The crab was ginormous. We ordered the set menu which is always the best. 9 of us, $100 a person. Totally worth it.Salted egg shrink and fish skin fried. Very Singaporean and very cool. Salted egg coated crab and pepper crab two way. Delicious. Great view if you were to sit outside as it's right by the bay. Grab home - as in, using your Grab app (Uber is no longer allowed since April in Singapore or Malaysia, good riddance if you ask me) and you should find a car sharing service nearby.I do love me some Singapore!","53":"Went here during a business trip. Had to stop by twice to try two different type of crabs. Black pepper and chilly sauce crabs. We like the chilly one better","54":"Alaays good, expensive but always good. The chili crab, i have spent so much on those crabs.","55":"Everything about this place was great aside from the price. Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish.","56":"Not worth the hype. \u00c2\u00a0Crab was good, but service was mediocre. \u00c2\u00a0Got in right away but we were there 10 mins before they opened. \u00c2\u00a0They forgot two of our entrees we ordered. Very nice servers, super crowded- clearly a local and tourist favorite. \u00c2\u00a0$$$$ dinner and we still left a bit hungry. \u00c2\u00a0Good location. \u00c2\u00a0Close to marina bay and other restaurants if the wait gets too long!","57":"Really good seafood restaurant. The price is fair. For every bite of eaten, you can feel, yes, the seafood worth the price!","58":"1kg for s$88 for non swim crab, it is somewhat pricey and no service at all. \u00c2\u00a0They told the customers 2pm last call for ordering and the restaurant close at 3pm. \u00c2\u00a0A few tables came in around 1:30pm, they didn't come to us to play the order, when they finally do. \u00c2\u00a0The dishes took sometimes to come, then as you dig your hands into working on the crab, the waitress came asking for payment on the total. \u00c2\u00a0 All of us must clean our hands and get the money or card to pay first before continuing eating. This is for a pricy restaurant in the area and no customer service while they was not short hand at all, then they force you to drop everything to make payment. \u00c2\u00a0Unbelievable and unacceptable.","59":"Three things my Buds from the Red Dot said I must try- \u00c2\u00a0Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Bah Kuh Teh and \u00c2\u00a0Singapore Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0I crossed the first two at various hawker centers around town. \u00c2\u00a0For the Chili Crab many recommend me to come here. \u00c2\u00a0Arrived here via metro around 1300. \u00c2\u00a0Restaurant was at half capacity. \u00c2\u00a0The lunch rush crowd gone and no reservation needed. \u00c2\u00a0Yes!!!The food: Appetizer- shrimp with pumpkin pur\u00c3\u00a9e. \u00c2\u00a0Really good! \u00c2\u00a0Shrimp Fried Rice- Another great dish. \u00c2\u00a0Enough for 2 people.Main- Singapore Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0Excellent!! \u00c2\u00a0Very flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0Spice level was just right. \u00c2\u00a0Enough kick to enjoy. \u00c2\u00a0Generous portion and good to the last bite.Environment\/Service: Great! \u00c2\u00a0The waiter was very attentive. \u00c2\u00a0He also let me know I that I ordered enough for 2 people. \u00c2\u00a0Glad I stopped because I was about to order two more dishes. \u00c2\u00a0Love the bibs and large hand washing stations. \u00c2\u00a0You don't have that same luxury The meal was worth the price. \u00c2\u00a0Glad I listened to my buds that pointed me this way.","60":"196 SGD (Singapore Dollar) for some crab and fish seems like we were gettin' played by our Singaporean brothas and sistuhs, but no, we just had no idea what the hell we were ordering. Just look at the sgd\/gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay, or that will satisfy ur belly. Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!! Happy hawking!!!","61":"Someone at the hotelWhere I am staying recommended this restaurant. After a walk in Chinatown we decided to come here. We got seated right away and we ordered the Alaska King Crab.1.3 kg ( half of the full crab ) about 200 SGD and we got the seafood noodles. The sauce for the Chili \u00c2\u00a0Alaska King crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what I was expecting.Service was also very disappointing, workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat. Felt like we were been hustled, peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table 2 SGD in the bill, bread rolls that I didn't even touch also put in the bill, at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it. I would not Recommend this place, way better other places in Singapore to have chili crabs \u00c2\u00a0.","62":"Jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs. My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs.","63":"Holy cow! Totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands. Waited all day to come try Jumbo Seafood for dinner and was so disappointed! The whole dining experience was meh. There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating. Nothing really wow'ed us, we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid. Honestly, every hawker stand we tried, the food was SO good! Being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip, we were slightly bitter and disappointed.","64":"A Singapore institution that never disappoints! \u00c2\u00a0Situated on the shores of the River, this beautiful setting in a warm Singapore evening watching the people cruise by.We started with a squid appetizer followed by Pepper Crab and Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Crab comes with amazing sauce that cannot be described. \u00c2\u00a0Perfect little dough balls for mopping up the extra sauce. \u00c2\u00a0Love this place.","65":"I am aware that Jumbo Seafood is a total tourist trap and that prices are high. That said, I was taken to a \"non-touristy\" chilli crab spot by someone who lived in Singapore previously and did not enjoy the crab at all. Since this was his first trip to Singapore, I figured why not go with Jumbo. I made a reservation for prime dinner time about 45 days in advance. You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy. So much fun. We ate in silence as we concentrated on getting all the crab meat out. I may have flung some crab onto the glass window next to where we were sitting. Oops!)-Fried buns (Perfect for soaking up the chilli sauce).-Cereal Prawns (Skip! Do not believe the hype, it was not worth it).We were in an out within an hour and were very satisfied with our seafood feast.","66":"Underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here. We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored.","67":"During my 3 days stay in Singapore in March of 2019, I cannot not try the Singapore Award Winning Chilly Crab here!! I was sooo excited to come, and I have to say, by far, it is the best crab I've ever had in my life!!The sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut. I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!! During the past 5 months, I have tried a couple of Malaysian and Chinese restaurants in the Northeast and haven't found anything that was close to this!! I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!! \u00c2\u00a0OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive. I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!","68":"Came for the chili crab and was NOT disappointed. This stuff is so good and a cant miss in Singapore. I had found jumbo seafood on a list of best chili crab and had that recommendation seconded by a local so I couldn't say no! One chili crab is about the right size for two people and do no miss the bao buns on the side to soak up all that delicious chili crab sauce. Also prepared go get messy digging in! We had just a side of broccoli with the crab and honestly were so stuffed we didn't need any other sides. The wait was long but they take your name and number and Clarke Quay is a great place to walk around, so just expect it to take a little time for your turn!","69":"Chili crab is excellent!! Their fried rice is one of the most well made fried rice I've ever had. Each grain is perfectly saut\u00c3\u00a9ed and not overly saucily or oily.","70":"I really don't get the hype. A single chili crab was 88 SGD, which is about $65. For that kind of money, I could go to an AYCE buffet in Vegas and get unlimited crab legs. The flavor is pretty mediocre too. We ordered pea sprouts, but they were the baby kind, not the tastier, more mature kind. And some sort of scallops in taro which I could have done without. Actually I could have done without the whole meal. There are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other -- make sure you go to the right one. Reservations recommended. This place gets busy.","71":"A must-visit for visitors to Singapore, Jumbo Seafood is the place to come for the classic Singaporean dish of chili crab! It's messy (wear a bib!), it's spicy, it's sweet--it actually reminds me of the classic Chinese tomato and egg dish (perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients)! The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp! Luckily, the crispy, sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal, even eaten on its own!","72":"Salted egg coated food. That's what this place is all about. My colleagues and I came here for dinner. None of us live here as it's super expensive to dine without expense account. The crab was ginormous. We ordered the set menu which is always the best. 9 of us, $100 a person. Totally worth it.Salted egg shrink and fish skin fried. Very Singaporean and very cool. Salted egg coated crab and pepper crab two way. Delicious. Great view if you were to sit outside as it's right by the bay. Grab home - as in, using your Grab app (Uber is no longer allowed since April in Singapore or Malaysia, good riddance if you ask me) and you should find a car sharing service nearby.I do love me some Singapore!","73":"Went here during a business trip. Had to stop by twice to try two different type of crabs. Black pepper and chilly sauce crabs. We like the chilly one better","74":"Alaays good, expensive but always good. The chili crab, i have spent so much on those crabs.","75":"Everything about this place was great aside from the price. Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish.","76":"Not worth the hype. \u00c2\u00a0Crab was good, but service was mediocre. \u00c2\u00a0Got in right away but we were there 10 mins before they opened. \u00c2\u00a0They forgot two of our entrees we ordered.

It is a less known location and not as commercial as Jumbo Seafood and others. But you get a more local feel here. The service was great having them explain the items to you. Make sure you know how large the crab will be, because I did not know, and it made a big dent on our final tab. We ordered the White Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab. It was my first time with the White Pepper Crab, and I enjoyed that more than the Chili Crab. The Chili Crab here has more of a mala taste to the chili. I also liked dipping the mantou into the White Pepper Crab more. We also got the clams and some veggies. All very tasty and done well. They offer gloves and utensils. Get a coconut as a drink. Our crabs came out to be around 1.5kg. So our check was over $300. One crab is plenty for 3 people, even 4, but we went all out.","82":"If your desire for Singapore's supposed classic dish has grown stronger with every ad you see for it, you will not go wrong with HolyCrab. It's all about the signature dish here. You can get the classic dish, Singapore Chili Crab, which we did. The also have their own variations. The Green Mumbo was suggested and I must say it's sauce was the best, even better than the classic. Our service was excellent. Explanations and suggestions were generous. One note of caution: pricing. You pay per 100 grams of crab, live weight. The crab is not weighed before you so you don't really know what you are in for as far as the total bill. You are told the crabs range to 1KG and up. At our night, the Green Mumbo was 1.5kg, so 150 Singaporean dollars, or about $120US. But you don't have to get a crab each. If you are just wanting to try the best of Singapore, one crab per table of 4, with plenty of fry bread and other accompaniment should be fine. I strongly recommend the pork belly bits. I know. Shoot me for ordering pork at a seafood restaurant.","83":"Damn it's good. Damn it's pricey. \u00c2\u00a0Make a reservation because it's a small place with limited seating and people get easily turned away. \u00c2\u00a0Start with one crab and a just some sides before deciding you want more- we ordered two and it was more than two of us could handle!","84":"For a place that has crab in the namesake, I definitely expected better. I was embarrassed to take a coworker here for the first chili crab experience. It turned out to be far too sweet and not enough spice for the whole package. The mantou (bun) they serve with the crab is also different than what you would expect - it's a giant one and not the small fried ones. Interesting selection of beer though - be warned if you're going to expense the meal if you order the Fucking Hell beer. The receipt will say \"Beer - Fucking Hell\" on the itemized list; might raise some questions.","85":"The crab and seafood fried rice is delicious, the bok choy is flavorful, but the stars of the show were the 48 day aged wagyu, which was cooked to perfection and the Atlantic cod which was crispy and soft in all the right places. Unfortunately, we didn't get any crab during this visit but we'll be back! The service is phenomenal. It's a hip new vibe with limited seating. They take reservations so if you don't have one- you might be waiting for a while.","86":"Food was amazing, I highly recommend this place. The wait team is very helpful and provide great recommendations.","87":"This place was good. A bit basic.Crab fried rice was the best. The beer was a novelty.","88":"A fantastic find near to Bugis JunctionWe were keen on finding a place to indulge our passion for Singapore chilli crab. We happened across this small, clean and wonderfully friendly restaurant located quite close to the Intercontinental Hotel. It didn't disappoint. The service was fast and the food excellent. We went with a chilli crab and a white pepper crab. We could have done with just one, but hey, we don't get to Singapore all that often. Highly recommended.","89":"We didn't make reservation since we didn't know when we're done with sightseeing. 6pm and we were the only customer. Service was great. Price is pretty steep but we only visit Singapore once a year and we wanted to eat the best. Did not disappoint!!We tried the combination, half red sauce and the other green. If we come back next year, we'll stick with Red sauce. It's really GOOD!!","90":"I read alot of rave reviews of the green mamba crab so i decided to try this place out. I thought it would be a very unique experience, however, it tasted just like a normal curry crab. The crab price is also similar to other top places for seafood. The crab meat was also mediocre, nothing extraordinary nothing bad. The noodles were also mediocre. Strong flavors but nothing special. Clams were average. The vegatable was the best tasting dish of the night and very fresh.","91":"A Must -- Fantastic Chili Crab!Best chili-crab we've had -- try the chef's special green chili. And definitely get the buns to soak up the sauce. Fun spot, great vibe.Quality was excellent, fresh crab (you get to preview your meal before it's cooked!) excellent flavor, and the sauce is better than other places.Chef\/Owner Elton is awesome -- super-friendly, super-helpful, and perfects an already great experience.","92":"Update: I strongly recommended Holycrab to my good friend Cesar and crew who are arriving from overseas. \u00c2\u00a0Please take good care of him! \u00c2\u00a0Cheers! \u00c2\u00a0PS: salted duck egg and green chili are the best! Again, this place is THE new standard in Singaporean chili crab .","93":"Simply amazing crab (and service)! \u00c2\u00a0I would dub this the new standard in Singaporean chili crab.","94":"We had dreams of chili crab ever since we booked our flight to Singapore. While we received many recommendations to various spots, this place stood out with some of the best reviews. They didn't disappoint. We got a larger crab, prepped two ways - traditional and black pepper. We couldn't' decide which we liked better because both were so delicious. We also ordered some fried buns to soak up the sauce. It was our first full meal in Singapore during our trip, and we could not have picked out a better place to kick off our trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I'd wholeheartedly recommend anyone to come check them out.","95":"The chili crab is delicious! I would highly recommend the crab fried rice! \u00c2\u00a0We are still talking about it the next day.","96":"Our latest great find! Our group went for the green chilli crab, and worked our way through the whole menu. Every dish we ordered was a certifiable hit! The green chilli crab and the bread particularly raised the standards--we had chilli crab and bread in another recommended place the next day which paled in comparison. The owner\/chef Elton was himself very visible but unobtrusive and respectful of our privacy, until we called him and he came quite warm and chatty with his inside stories of the different dishes and offerings, which further increased our appreciation of the food and the total experience.A must for you to try once, and come back to every time you go to Singapore!","97":"Green Mamba crab is full of flavor, very strong lime leaves. The black pepper is delicious and sweet. Large crabs with sweet meat. We had the lightly fried bread, highly recommended to soak up the sauce. Garlic vegetables hit the spot. Very friendly service. I like that they provide a bowl of lemon lime leaf water to clean your hands afterwards, so they don't smell like chili.","98":"Recommended by a friend and was not disappointed. Cold beer and unique take on crab preparations. We got the green curry crabs and stir fried vegetables. As a starter we had deep fried pork bellies (excellent with the cold beer). Very close to JW Marriott and Raffles. Highly recommend reservations. We will go again.","99":"Amazing crab dishes. Big and fat crabs for crab lovers.

The receipt will say \"Beer - Fucking Hell\" on the itemized list; might raise some questions.","105":"The crab and seafood fried rice is delicious, the bok choy is flavorful, but the stars of the show were the 48 day aged wagyu, which was cooked to perfection and the Atlantic cod which was crispy and soft in all the right places. Unfortunately, we didn't get any crab during this visit but we'll be back! The service is phenomenal. It's a hip new vibe with limited seating. They take reservations so if you don't have one- you might be waiting for a while.","106":"Food was amazing, I highly recommend this place. The wait team is very helpful and provide great recommendations.","107":"This place was good. A bit basic.Crab fried rice was the best. The beer was a novelty.","108":"A fantastic find near to Bugis JunctionWe were keen on finding a place to indulge our passion for Singapore chilli crab. We happened across this small, clean and wonderfully friendly restaurant located quite close to the Intercontinental Hotel. It didn't disappoint. The service was fast and the food excellent. We went with a chilli crab and a white pepper crab. We could have done with just one, but hey, we don't get to Singapore all that often. Highly recommended.","109":"We didn't make reservation since we didn't know when we're done with sightseeing. 6pm and we were the only customer. Service was great. Price is pretty steep but we only visit Singapore once a year and we wanted to eat the best. Did not disappoint!!We tried the combination, half red sauce and the other green. If we come back next year, we'll stick with Red sauce. It's really GOOD!!","110":"I read alot of rave reviews of the green mamba crab so i decided to try this place out. I thought it would be a very unique experience, however, it tasted just like a normal curry crab. The crab price is also similar to other top places for seafood. The crab meat was also mediocre, nothing extraordinary nothing bad. The noodles were also mediocre. Strong flavors but nothing special. Clams were average. The vegatable was the best tasting dish of the night and very fresh.","111":"A Must -- Fantastic Chili Crab!Best chili-crab we've had -- try the chef's special green chili. And definitely get the buns to soak up the sauce. Fun spot, great vibe.Quality was excellent, fresh crab (you get to preview your meal before it's cooked!) excellent flavor, and the sauce is better than other places.Chef\/Owner Elton is awesome -- super-friendly, super-helpful, and perfects an already great experience.","112":"Update: I strongly recommended Holycrab to my good friend Cesar and crew who are arriving from overseas. \u00c2\u00a0Please take good care of him! \u00c2\u00a0Cheers! \u00c2\u00a0PS: salted duck egg and green chili are the best! Again, this place is THE new standard in Singaporean chili crab .","113":"Simply amazing crab (and service)! \u00c2\u00a0I would dub this the new standard in Singaporean chili crab.","114":"We had dreams of chili crab ever since we booked our flight to Singapore. While we received many recommendations to various spots, this place stood out with some of the best reviews. They didn't disappoint. We got a larger crab, prepped two ways - traditional and black pepper. We couldn't' decide which we liked better because both were so delicious. We also ordered some fried buns to soak up the sauce. It was our first full meal in Singapore during our trip, and we could not have picked out a better place to kick off our trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I'd wholeheartedly recommend anyone to come check them out.","115":"The chili crab is delicious! I would highly recommend the crab fried rice! \u00c2\u00a0We are still talking about it the next day.","116":"Our latest great find! Our group went for the green chilli crab, and worked our way through the whole menu. Every dish we ordered was a certifiable hit! The green chilli crab and the bread particularly raised the standards--we had chilli crab and bread in another recommended place the next day which paled in comparison. The owner\/chef Elton was himself very visible but unobtrusive and respectful of our privacy, until we called him and he came quite warm and chatty with his inside stories of the different dishes and offerings, which further increased our appreciation of the food and the total experience.A must for you to try once, and come back to every time you go to Singapore!","117":"Green Mamba crab is full of flavor, very strong lime leaves. The black pepper is delicious and sweet. Large crabs with sweet meat. We had the lightly fried bread, highly recommended to soak up the sauce. Garlic vegetables hit the spot. Very friendly service. I like that they provide a bowl of lemon lime leaf water to clean your hands afterwards, so they don't smell like chili.","118":"Recommended by a friend and was not disappointed. Cold beer and unique take on crab preparations. We got the green curry crabs and stir fried vegetables. As a starter we had deep fried pork bellies (excellent with the cold beer). Very close to JW Marriott and Raffles. Highly recommend reservations. We will go again.","119":"Amazing crab dishes. Big and fat crabs for crab lovers. I would definitely recommend to my families and friends.","120":"What else hasn't been said about the super popular Tian Tian chicken and rice stall? I'm not sure if I can add anything else. Yes, Bourdain was here. As usual, he is right. This quintessential Singaporean dish of chicken and rice is so perfectly done that you can't find fault in it. Incredibly soft chicken, fragrant rice and the sauce is deliciously spiced with ginger puree. I ordered a large portion (S$8.80 for a large though?!) so I could get more chicken and got the soy egg for extra protein. There wasn't a wait when I came in at 11am. The crowds came at lunch time when the surrounding office workers were out. I'm not one to stand in line for a long time and there are other chicken and rice stalls at Maxwell's which are probably worth a try too.","121":"There are 2 famous chicken rice places at Maxwell, and they're only a few stalls down from each other. Tian tian was the original and occupies stalls 10-11.The rice plate comes in small, medium, large. The small is only 3.50 - it's nice to have the option of small so you \u00c2\u00a0can try more stuff. They also have other dishes, but the rice plate is the star. Order at line A and pickup at line B. The chicken rice is chicken breast (boneless and skinless), which I appreciate. It's super tender. The rice also has good chicken flavor. Warning: the hot sauce sauce is hot.","122":"Bookmarked this place so many years ago and is pretty much the only thing I know I wanted to check out in Singapore haha.No long lines, solid chicken and flavorful rice. They may keep my name.","123":"Tian Tian does not make the same Hainanese chicken rice dish that your mom used to make (sorry Mom, it's true)! \u00c2\u00a0Actually, I cannot really say that my mom ever cooked this dish... but if she had, then it still would not have compared. \u00c2\u00a0Tian Tian's chicken rice dish truly lives up to the legend it has become!There are enough reviews detailing the deliciousness and tenderness of this dish, so I will provide you with a pro tip - the line here can get long quickly, so plan to stop in at an off-time (ya know, not during the typical lunch\/dinner rush times). \u00c2\u00a0I stopped in early on a Friday afternoon and walked right up and ordered - score! \u00c2\u00a0Shortly after I sat down to wait the brief wait for my order, the line grew ten-plus long in a snap.Tian Tian is definitely a must-try in Singapore!*****FIVE STARS*****","124":"I came here on my first day in Singapore and managed to skip any lines as it was about 10:45am. Score for no lines at a Michelin rated hawker stall!Went ahead and ordered their specialty Hainam chicken dish. I thought it was good and what snt it apart, was the gravy sauce! You can't find this sauce anywhere and it is probably what gives this place the 1 Michelin Star rating.After much thought, I think America has spoiled me in that theres so much options and similar to many of the famous hawker stall flavors here I in Singapore. I would defInitely recommend coming here to try the sauces Hainan Chicken if there's no ginormous line!","125":"During my recent trip to Singapore, I went on a mission to find the best chicken rice. Tian Tian, recommended by the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, was the first stop on my quest.Tian Tian is located at the Maxwell Food Centre, a short walk from Marina Bay. Don't be alarmed at the long line. It moves quickly!We ordered a medium chicken rice to share (but came back again the next day and ordered our own), which set us back 5 Singapore dollars ($3.69 USD). A total steal for lunch.What makes this place so special is that they do a simple dish really well:- the chicken is perfectly poached, soft & juicy- the rice is fragrant and tasty, not bland like at Hawker Chan- the chili sauce that comes with the dish is super tasty, there's chili, citrus (probably lime), a little bit of oil, a perfect topping for this chicken rice dish. I need to get the recipe for this chili sauce because I want to drizzle it on top of all my chicken rice meals.If you are in Singapore, you MUST visit Tian Tian.","126":"Okay, so its been 9 years since i have been here (yelp was not in singapore yet) but it is still my favorite hainan chicken rice ever! Braving the long lines can be problematic especially when tempted by so many food stalls at the Maxwell food market! Their chicken achieves that elusive perfect balance between cooked just enough to be tender but not too well done for the meat to be dry. \u00c2\u00a0Texture is spot on. Gingery sauce and spicy sauce is delicious. \u00c2\u00a0I miss this place still","127":"Born out of frugality and created by servant-class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken, chicken rice dishes are a staple to Singaporean cuisine. I did the chicken rice challenge between Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Liao Fan Hawker Chan. The ever-so-popular Michelin Guide praised one with a single star, and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain (RIP).In comparison, both prices were similar, and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours. The most significant difference between these two stands was their style. One was soy sauce based, while the other was a stock-based. If I had a vote between the two, purely based on my opinion, I would give my vote to this restaurant. I loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken. Served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity. Along with the meal, they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce, which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain. I loved this place for the price. Although it did not fill me up, it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day.","128":"There's chicken rice and then there's Tian Tian's chicken rice. This is hands down the best chicken rice I've ever eaten. The rice is flavorful with a light black sauce and chicken juice gravy over it and the chicken is perfectly moist. It pairs really well with the lime based chili sauce that gives it just the right kick.The store does lots of takeout orders so you can order ahead if you want to skip the line. We got there just before the lunch rush on a weekday at 11.30am or so and ended up waiting 10 minutes. It's a well oiled machine but I'd expect a wait of around 15 to 20 minutes during peak times. On the bright side, you can easily spot the store by the long line!","129":"Never eaten so delicious Hainanese chicken with rice before. The chicken is tender and smooth and the rice is flavoured with ginger, scallion and oil. It tasted awesome!!Just to be prepared to come early to avoid long line up. Even so, there is a very good system of collecting money on one aide and have the dishes ready on the other side.","130":"My friends and I went to Singapore recently and planned our days around eating. Of course Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was on our list and luckily we went when there were only a few people in line! We ordered 2 large plates of Chicken and Rice and 1 plate of Beansprouts and Cuttlefish to share. The chicken was perfectly poached and tender and the chicken-stock rice was fragrant and flavorful, the dish was served with a citrus chili sauce which was unique and tasty. We lucked out with not having to wait but I've heard a wait of 45mins-60mins is standard, a must try if ever in Singapore.","131":"Rated to be one of the top places to get Chicken rice in Singapore so I had to try it. This joint has 2 locations but I wanted to try the popular one that is located in the Maxwell food center.Located on the opposite side of Maxwell ave of the hawker center, you will put your order in and grab a ticket. You'll then hand the ticket to the other window and they will serve you your food. The line can queue up depending on the time, especially during the lunch hour. However I showed up a little before 11:30 on a Tuesday and there was no wait!Most popular is the medium chicken rice, which includes chicken the rice and the chili sauce all on a plate. Chicken was very moist and tender like what people said but the chili sauce is what makes it really good. I highly recommend that you give this place a try although it is not my personal favorite in Singapore","132":"Another Michelin-rated hawker meal. \u00c2\u00a0Another lineup and another great meal for only $5SG. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was smooth and rice was not oily and tastes good. \u00c2\u00a0You cannot beat the value\/taste proposition for sure. \u00c2\u00a0Is this a \"wow, out of this world meal\"? \u00c2\u00a0Not quite, but still worth a try if you are in the area..","133":"Best chicken rice ever. Cute in shape, tastes fabulous. I think how they cook and seasons rice is totally different than others.","134":"Got there 15 min before it closes. The line was not bad for Saturd night & they cranked out the orders very quickly. This place def knows how to handle the long queue which its fame has brought. \u00c2\u00a0We ordered 2 medium chicken rice $5 each) & 1 side of vege in oyster sauce $6). \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was solid, relatvely tender & not too dry, skins & bone attached. Most of the chicken were good cuts with minimal unwanted parts. \u00c2\u00a0When served it already has a layer of light sauce on it, but they also privode you with a side of spicy dipping sauce. Again I wish they have that Cantonese style dipping sauce that has more minced ginger & slightly saltier. \u00c2\u00a0The rice was also good, cooked in the chicken's own juice. \u00c2\u00a0The vege was pretty good as well, lightly flavored & still relatively crunchyOverall the place serves solid food, but I could barely distinguish it from the other good hainan chicken rice places.","135":"I can understand why this place is so popular (we showed up around 11 and there already was a line). The chicken was very tender and moist, though I'm confused by why there was no skin included. Rice was also well flavored, if a bit too soft for my taste. No aircon in the hawker center, so grab a coconut or soursop juice from one of the stalls across and you're good to go.","136":"I love coming to Singapore to visit family. \u00c2\u00a0First stop Tian, Tian hawker stall. \u00c2\u00a0Hawker stalls are the place to eat for some great food in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Chicken and rice are pretty much a staple in Singapore so its easy to find.The food here is sooooo amazing and delicious! Simple cuisine big flavor and so filling. \u00c2\u00a0Good service. \u00c2\u00a0Then you grab a seat and chow down.","137":"Okay, do bear in mind I have been to Singapore 8 or so times in the last 3 years.. Still have not made to this place until recently. I had one day that I was in Singapore before the work week started and I had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook. Botanical garden, orchid garden, garden by the bay's skywalk, Chinatown was next. So I arrived and it was hot - so I was very lost and was happy to be lost. Lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot. All I really wanted was Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. Truth be told, it's changed in the last decade, or maybe I've changed. The first time I had it was in 2010. I thought it was disgusting. I did not have any acquired taste for Asian food then. I barely saw any Asians in my life. Now I must admit, I've got a more refined taste for everything Asian. Tian tian has a line. On a Sunday afternoon at 3:55 PM. All tourists, I gathered. Anthony Bourdain was here. The lady in front of me was from London, Asian British lady. On her honeymoon. We chatted about this spot, and we each ordered a small plate. Holy cow, $3 USD basically. We ate happily with chili on the side (we made friends while standing in line). The location is called Maxwell Center or something with Maxwell in it. You need to walk away from Chinatown, passing by some super cool buildings that house Chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area. Excellent atmosphere. Exceptional chicken dish. I would definitely take friends and families there. Not that I have anyone who would visit me in Singapore. Not that I go to Singapore that often. But this chicken is growing on me. And this stall.","138":"There was a line and they were prepared with lanes set up. It moved pretty quickly though. I think the other famous spot was closed so this one was extra busy. I ordered the thigh and greens on the side. The hardest was finding a spot to sit to eat. The chicken was top notch. Flavorful and super juicy and soft. The pepper was great...I asked for 2. Lol! I went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left. They discounted to $5 each. I took 2. Even the breast was super moist. I wish I could eat this every day!","139":"I was building this up in my head so much, that I was sure I was going to disappointed. Such a cheap Michelin star restaurant - there's gotta be a catch right?Not with Tian Tian.We had to wait in line for about 10 mins. Compared to the Bay area, where it takes 10 mins to just find you a table, this was a breeze. The plates & bowls on which they actually served the chicken & soup, while not perfectly clean, was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers. Hey, that's how it goes, right?Now, the actual food. The rice, was something you can eat just by itself. It was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world. And it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken. The soup just tied it all together.I was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones?! I was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience. But overall, for that price and quality, a must go. But don't wait in line too long though. The other chicken rice places in the same hawker center and not bad at all.","140":"What else hasn't been said about the super popular Tian Tian chicken and rice stall?

I wish I could eat this every day!","159":"I was building this up in my head so much, that I was sure I was going to disappointed. Such a cheap Michelin star restaurant - there's gotta be a catch right?Not with Tian Tian.We had to wait in line for about 10 mins. Compared to the Bay area, where it takes 10 mins to just find you a table, this was a breeze. The plates & bowls on which they actually served the chicken & soup, while not perfectly clean, was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers. Hey, that's how it goes, right?Now, the actual food. The rice, was something you can eat just by itself. It was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world. And it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken. The soup just tied it all together.I was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones?! I was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience. But overall, for that price and quality, a must go. But don't wait in line too long though. The other chicken rice places in the same hawker center and not bad at all.","160":"Thanks Yelp for directing me to this restaurant as my very first meal in Singapore ever!I wasn't convinced that this place warranted the reviews when I saw a couple patsy white ribs in some clear-ish broth. How could anything be delicious when it looked boiled with no seasonings? Nope nope nope! I stand corrected! I can admit I was very wrong. The meat was unlike any other ribs I have ever had and the broth is just an extra bonus. How something so unassuming and simple can be so good I can not pretend to even know, but my socks were completely knocked off. Can soup make a grown woman cry? Yes, yes it can. The ambiance and service is simple, the price is low and the product is amazing. Will I fly back to Singapore for ribs in soup...? I just might...","161":"Best food I've had in Singapore. The service was fast and food came out almost immediately. But the Bak Kut Teh is to die for. This is a traditional Singaporean dish that consists of braised pork ribs with tea broth. The broth is rich with a rich garlic flavor. The meat practically falls off the bone. A large portion is around $10 Singaporean dollars ($7.22 US dollars). Plenty of seating but it can get cramped since there's so many customers. However, I miss their food a ton and would for sure come back if I ever am in Singapore again.","162":"Best Bak Kut Teh (Pork-Rib Soup) in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0Too many good food in Singapore, and it's hard to say which one is the best. However, if you ask for Bak Kut Teh recommendation, I gotta say @songfamedan is the best among all! I'm so impressed by the tenderness of the pork ribs, which they even show you the level of tenderness of each pork-rib soup on their menu. No wonder they are listed under the Michelin Bib Gourmand!

I personally enjoy the kick, but I can see how it can be too much for some. Other than that, the broth is sooo warming. I enjoyed it in 90 degree heat, so I can't imagine how good it is when it's cold (does it even get cold in Singapore...?) The pork rib is tender and meaty- I loved biting it off the bone!Best part is that the soup is unlimited!!! Once they see that you're running low, a server comes to refill your bowl. Don't be discouraged if you see a line outside, as it moves super quickly!","164":"I get the hype... \u00c2\u00a0It's one of the most consistent places in terms of both food quality and service even though the food is fairly simple. \u00c2\u00a0I find myself coming here pretty much once a week on the weekends to get my fix.The broth is definitely the highlight for me. \u00c2\u00a0It's peppery but there's no sharp heat. \u00c2\u00a0It's so comforting that I usually get at least 2~3 refills. \u00c2\u00a0The meat is pretty tender, but the broth is really the star. \u00c2\u00a0I personally get the large size because I don't get rice or noodle, but I think most people will be fine withe regular size. \u00c2\u00a0The other items are pretty decent as well, but I always stick to the Bak Kut Teh as the primary focus.The only down side is the line\/queue... \u00c2\u00a0They do make the wait time more productive by taking order first.","165":"This soup wasn't bad, just not my favorite. It's a peppery porky broth, but the soup and pork ribs were little bland by my standards. It's nice that they refill the broth though! I didn't really get the hype around this, but maybe i'm just not used to Singaporean cuisine.get the lemon iced tea- really refreshing!","166":"I would come here and just get the pork soup. We got the normal one large ( 4 pieces vs 3 pieces for rib).You get unlimited broth! So we just got one large bowl with about 4 refills. Omg so good. So peppery. Keep in mind I haven't been to other ones, but I loved how homey and cheap it was. The other items we got were pork trotters, chicken feet, lightly fried chicken rolls. None of those really stuck out tbh, I'd stick to just the soup. They weren't bad by any means, just nothing could match the soup. Some soup, a little bit of rice, and I think you are set.We also got the soursop drink, and I really thought the fruit worked well","167":"Damn, this place is the place to come for dinner. We had: veggies, beancurd skin, pork belly, premium loin ribs soup, and rice.The premium loin ribs soup was very very tasty. The soup was very well made and with lots of punch.The flavor was on the spot. I addition, the ribs were very tasty up to the bone.The punch of the night was the pork belly. It had the proper combination of fat and skinny meat. The sauce made the dish even more tastier. I gotta warn that this place gets pretty crowded and the wait line can take up to 1hr or more. So, be prepared for such long line and long wait time.","168":"So so simple but so so good, and love that it opens at 9 am so my friends and I could get a breakfast in.Ordered the pork rib soup (which is what they're known for, especially if it's in the name of the restaurant) and they constantly refill the soup which is nice. It tastes heavily of white pepper but I love it, and the pork is so tender it falls off the bone. Definitely one of those restoring and revitalizing feeling soups.Also got the braised pork belly which was good, but if you're sticking to a smaller breakfast, just go for the bak kut teh Would definitely come back for another","169":"Oh my oh my do not judge a book by its cover ! Their pork rib soup may look simple, but i like to think it has magical powers!! The peppery and warm broth hits your throat like no other. It really warms up your body and makes you feel so good. The soup is sweet and peppery, but never too overpowering. Not to mention, the pork ribs are so damn tender. So easy to bite off and doesn't have a weird meaty taste. Just so damn perfect. I think this dish is pretty healthy ??? I had a sore throat the day I tried this dish and it completely healed itself the next day! What a magical soup this is.","170":"Go a little late to avoid long lines during meal hours. They have the best Bak Kut Teh (pork rib soup) ever!

And the staff is friendly and helpful as well.I ordered the Ba Ku Teh, which at about $7 comes with 3 pork bones and soup. But as you are eating the bones and the soup, they come around and refill your bowl with more soup! The big benefit of that is that the soup always tastes super hot, because there's only so much soup at any given time, and every time you get more, the soup pipping hot, which keeps the experience super enjoyable.The broth has a rich tasty pork taste, with a bit of pepper in it. It was a hearty, warm loving soup and I personally liked the amount of pepper, I thought it balanced the soup really well.The Cai Lan was also pretty good, as well as the Lemon Tea.

I was at a work holiday party a few weeks ago and learned my colleague next to me at dinner used to live in Singapore. He told me to eat here and order Buah Keluak Ayam as it would \"change my life.\" I made reservations for dinner which we had last night.When I mentioned to people we were going here, there was a lot of hype. Someone said the chef is a national treasure. The concierge at our hotel said she has not been able to get into the restaurant as a local and was surprised I was able to secure a reservation. The anticipation was really high. Our Chinatown tour guide also shared with us about the Peranakan people and culture to prepare us for Peranakan cuisine.When we arrived, the host expected us, asking, \"Lisa?\" - first he seated us at a table in a high traffic area but we moved to a quiet side space. The restaurant is not very big so that might be why the reservations are hard to get.It turns out my mom was sitting in the same seat Michelle Obama had been sitting in 12 days prior, as the host shared a photograph of her sitting at the table with him shaking Barack Obama's hand. We started with this fried tofu skin stuffed with crab, shrimp, chicken, and water chestnuts. It was kind of like an over-fried shrimp toast, my mom suggested.For our dishes, my mom ordered butter prawns, I got the Buah Keluak Ayam, and Eric R. ordered the beef rendang. The server recommended nasi lemak (coconut rice) for Eric R. and my mom, and jasmine rice for my dish.When the dishes came out, Eric R. was the lucky one. His had a lot of flavor and spice, and we all liked it. His beef was also very tender. My mom's dish was prawns in shell that were not cleaned, with very little flavor, topped with \"egg floss\" which was not mentioned when she asked questions about the dish. The server warned me that the dish I ordered - some people love it and some people do not - but I was adamant that I must see if it will \"change my life.\"The story of the Buah Keluak Ayam is chicken stewed in a sauce with the \"buah keluak,\" a swamp-based \"nut\" that is a poisonous fruit. Only the Peranakan people know how to cook it without killing people. It holds hydrogen cyanide, which has been used in chemical weapons. The Peranakan people scoop out the center of the fruit, ferment it underground in ash for 40 days, and put it back in then boil it to remove the poison.A demitasse spoon was provided to scoop out this nut and mix it with my rice (which was adorned with fried shallots). Then, drizzle some sauce and supposedly, I would have some sort of food nirvana. Unfortunately, the Buah Keluak did not taste like the \"truffle of the swamp\" as I had hoped it would based on my colleague's enthusiasm for the dish.We also were essentially ignored by staff through much of the experience, and with tiny water glasses, we were often without drink. Eric R.'s dish was very spicy so he asked a server to leave a pitcher of waster but the server refused. Eventually, we were served a complimentary warm tapioca cake with palm sugar syrup, coconut milk, and coconut ice cream to cool Eric R.'s mouth and perhaps make up for poor service. The best parts of the meal were the rendang and the dessert. We left a bit disappointed with the experience given all of the hype, but it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try Peranakan food so now we can say we did.","202":"The decor of this place is on point. You can definitely find an instagram moment here. The server who greeted us was very friendly (and handsome). He seated us and then ended up being our server too. It is a pretty small place, but I imagine that he was spread a little thin. He maintained a helpful and friendly vibe throughout the whole meal. And we were there pretty late in the evening. I ordered a drink called a haliatini, which was probably the best drink that I've had since I can remember. The price is pretty standard for Singapore, probably even a little less given that this is a nice restaurant. We ordered the chicken wings and satay to start. Both were excellent. The wings came with this spicy, fishy, sauce. And the peanut sauce with the satay was on another level. For main courses we got the Daging Chabek beef cheeks and the garam assam fish. Both had some much flavor, some spicy heat, and everything else. Very well balanced. \u00c2\u00a0 And all of that was the perfect amount of food for two people who heavily eat.For the price point, this place is worth it. The only negative criticism that I have to say is that the napkins are paper, which kind of makes it feel like it's not as nice as it is. But since this is in a museum, I'm guessing that it's because washing cloth napkins might not be a feasible option. A very small detail and, in the end, who cares? Especially because I recently got yelled at somewhere else (Gaggan) for being too messy on my cloth napkin.","203":"The National Gallery is a treat to be walking around and even more so when you find yourself in a gastronomic beckoning called \"The National Kitchen\" - black panels with gold trims and a strangely harmonious cacophonyof floor tiles, the atmosphere is elegantly Singaporean. The black leather upholstered seats however is in a sad state of disrepair and really needs to be replaced. The back of my thighs were constantly reminded of how beat up they are. Food - good. End of story. Solid mustard green duck soup just right amount of sour. Kueh pie tee is a generous helping - 9 altogether unlike Candlenut with its skimpy 4.

Noodles was al dente and buah keluak sufficient. There was an undertone of coconut milk. Solid service.","204":"Nice, old-school classy restaurant. Food is good, but I do not think it is worth the price to pay for the food. Ordered the coronation chicken appetizer, cod with laksa sauce, and the eggplant sambal.

Also had the fried bean curd salad, definitely ensure you add the cucumber\/papaya julienne on top of the bean curd with that rich, deep sauce and let the flavor explosion begin. we had several other dishes, all wonderful.

The server was also very helpful as he heard our initial order and mentioned it would be a lot of food and helped us pare down (vs focusing solely on getting the largest order).","206":"Nice-ish Singaporean traditional food in the National GalleryFood tastes pretty good though a bit sweet overall. Details by dishes below- Beef rendang - very tender - perhaps even slightly too tender for our liking- Satay - well-grilled - a good starter- Dried Laksa - an interesting take on the classic SG dish - the dried version does not short-change the laksa taste at all - still retains that fragrance and touch of spiceBeautiful ambiance - a good spot to bring out of town guests","207":"There are two words that should describe this place: Dry Laksa. The preparation of this Singaporean staple is simply phenomenal, with a burst of many unbelievable flavors that have spice, tanginess and light sweetness of the coconut, all of which merge to create a dish with an unbelievable flavor profile. Admittedly, I will not call myself a Laksa expert as I was in Singapore quite briefly, but I do know a mouthwatering preparation of a dish when I try one. This is an absolute must.The establishment as a very beautiful interior and is located in the National Gallery, thus there is a museum like feel to the entire establishment. It is grand and beautiful, but dishes are priced very fairly and not over the top as many restaurants in Singapore would be with this type of ambiance. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, giving great recommendations from the menu to help newbies into Singapore food scene get oriented quickly.I really enjoyed the Singapore sling here as well. The cocktail was made with great proportions and was a perfect refreshment for a warm summer evening. It's unique flavor and festive appearance can serve as a complementing detail to an otherwise very grand environment.Aside from the Dry Laksa, tried a couple more dishes and was very impressed. Tau Hu Goreng - fried bean curd with cucumber and bean sprouts, topped with peanut sauce. Interesting dish, despite its simplicity, but can't say it was to my flavor profile personally. Kayu Pie Tee - fried rolls with bamboo, quite delicious and unique. A flavor unlike anything one would experience in the western world.There is no wonder that this restaurant sits in the Michelin Guide for Singapore, it is a phenomenal combination of elegance, authenticity and reasonable pricing.","208":"I stopped by this place to get some afternoon desserts with my family friend after walking around the National Gallery. We got 2 desserts and the chicken satay. Although there was a little too much chicken skin for me, the satay had really tender meat and seasoned pretty well. The kueh beng kah was a sticky cake with nice coconut and caramel flavors. The pilot hitam was my favorite! It is black glutinous rice with coconut milk and coconut ice cream. The rice stew isn't as thick as other places but I liked how I could the coconut flavors really came out especially with the ice cream. The hot rice with the cold ice cream gave the dessert a nice twist. The service was great: I remember a server brought us bowls to share our dessert before we even asked him to. The decor is really classy with mirrors all around and hints of gold, but also has elements of traditional South East Asian architecture like bamboos.

Everything here is slightly more upscale in its decor, and food preparation, so you'll find a $20 Hainanese Chicken Rice among other popular dishes priced upwards. The cocktails are good too.I suppose in keeping with both its upscale nature and its Singaporean hospitality, my crummily dressed self was seated in a far back corner behind the bar unseen by the top echelon of Singapore's diners. It also meant that service was slightly subpar as being in the dark corner made getting waiter attention difficult. Nonetheless I was in it for the food and it was fairly delicious. I started with a meaty duck soup. This was followed by a Malaysian spicy noodle dish that was actually made with Spaghetti pasta, and the \"starter\" was brought last, an oversized plate of turmeric chicken wings that had good flavour to them and again very sizable and meaty. I would save this place for a special occasion, but having preceded a visit here with a visit to the Peranakan Museum it seemed a suitable way to end the day.","213":"When in Singapore, you must try Peranakan or Nyonya cuisine. \u00c2\u00a0What is it? Well, it's essentially the result of melting Chinese, Malay and Indonesian cuisine into one...which is pretty representative of Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0 Violot Oon is one of Singapores original celebrity chefs - she's been doing this for over 50 years! I had the chance to enjoy a meal at National Kitchen during my stay in Singapore and it did not disappoint.The place: Situated on the second floor of the National Art Gallery, National Kitchen by Violet Oon makes you feel as if you've entered a French salon (says Conde Nast Traveler). \u00c2\u00a0I mean, just look at the place! It actually reminded me of this little French restaurant in Toronto called La Societe. The food: Mmmm...SO GOOD! For starters we had these little bundles of fried goodness called Ngoh Hiang $15. \u00c2\u00a0It's essentially deep fried prawns, crab, and chicken with water chestnut seasoned with five spice powder wrapped in bean curd skin. Dry Laksa $22 - I usually have the soupy laksa so this was a interesting change for me.Chap Chye $15 - it's a classic mixed veg dish, really good, but it wasn't anything special. Sambal Petai with Prawns $18 - Okay...so this....was interesting. \u00c2\u00a0This is \"stinky beans\" fried in sambal (shrimp) sauce. \u00c2\u00a0Love sambal sauce, but man, I couldn't take the stinky beans. \u00c2\u00a0Please note that it wasn't the flavoring or how it was cooked, in fact, I loved the spices and the sauce. \u00c2\u00a0I just was not a fan of the after taste that the stinky beans left.Tip: You must try their Kueh Beng Kah $10. \u00c2\u00a0 SUPER yummy tapioca cake toped with Gula Melaka Syrup and coconut milk.","214":"Located in the beautiful National Gallery with a fitting design style in the dining area. High Tea at National Kitchen is a great experience and at a very reasonable price point. Service was exceptional, every item was explained in depth. The waiter let us try three different teas - all of which were world class. This place has both great style and food quality. Recommend making reservations, even if the same day.","215":"It's a very busy place, so I thought it must be good. Ordered baked lobster, not as good as it should be. When it came up, it was lukewarm and a bit tough to chew. Full of senior citizens, not sure why. Think I am the only tourist dumb enough to order lobsters, no one else there did. Salads are very fresh.","216":"When in Singapore \u00c2\u00a0have Peranakan food.We searched out National Kitchen by Violet Oong after learning about the Peranakan during our visit earlier to the National Museum of Singapore nearby (hint: take the guided tour).We weren't sure whether we could get into the National Kitchen without paying for entry to the National Gallery. \u00c2\u00a0Turns out we could. \u00c2\u00a0The guard at the entrance was very helpful in showing us how to get to the restaurant (on the second floor) from the ground floor museum entrance.The dishes were served famiy style which I love since I get a chance to try all the dishes.We had a variety of dishes:Sambal Kimchiam Udang - Lily buds with Prawns \u00c2\u00a0and starfruit.Sambal Petai with Prawns - Stinky Green Bean Fried in Spicy \u00c2\u00a0Dried Prawn Sambal Sauce with Prawns.Dry Med Siam - Rice Noodles \u00c2\u00a0with Mee Siam Chili with Prawns , Bean Curd and Chinese ChivesGaram Assam FishKuay Pie Tee - famous must have. \u00c2\u00a0The brown colored sauce is sweet, the Sambal is spicy. \u00c2\u00a0All delicious! When in Singapore \u00c2\u00a0have Peranakan food!","217":"The food and drinks are quite expensive. Since the restuaurant is inside national gallery, the environment and decoration add points.","218":"I came here TWICE during my stay in Singapore. The food is exquisite.(Duh, it's Violet Oon!)Oh, but let's talk about the decore. Swoon!!! You are instantly transported to 1920's Peranaken wealth. Just. So. Charming. And. Lovely.Afterwards or before be sure to explore the original courts and the beautiful art exhibits throughout the National Gallery.Love. Love. Love the National Kitchen. And if I ever go back to Singapore, I will go back to this beautiful perfect place.","219":"Violet Oon has several restaurant locations throughout Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0This one is located in the City Hall section of the National Gallery. It's not every day that you get to experience dining in a beautiful historic building that houses a stellar art museum. \u00c2\u00a0It felt extravagant to go from viewing an amazing art exhibit, to then dining in a lavishly opulent historic setting. Reservations are a must. \u00c2\u00a0You can dine in the grand hall or on their scenic veranda. The menu is focused on Singaporean Asian influences. \u00c2\u00a0The service was fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0They were very accommodating for those of us in the group with dietary restrictions. \u00c2\u00a0The wine selection for a fancy spot was mediocre. \u00c2\u00a0Stick with the cocktails here. \u00c2\u00a0I was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their food, better than our expectations! \u00c2\u00a0I had the house specialty, the Beef Padang with coconut rice. \u00c2\u00a0I could have eaten the coconut rice by itself. \u00c2\u00a0It was PHENOMENAL!! \u00c2\u00a0The local chicken rice was bland in comparison. \u00c2\u00a0The beef padang paired with the coconut rice was one of my favorite dishes while in Singapore.NOTE: If you are low on fitbit steps, just go to the bathroom a couple of times. It's a trek to the restrooms located in the museum. \u00c2\u00a0It's easy to get lost. \u00c2\u00a0Definitely ask the staff for directions. They will actually walk out a bit with you and point you in the general direction until you find the signs that then lead you to the museum bathrooms in that section of the building.","220":"Dining here was a real treat. \u00c2\u00a0I enjoyed the venue so much. \u00c2\u00a0Located inside a large contemporary museum. \u00c2\u00a0It's not often you get to walk thru a closed museum, so quiet, then into an intimate, bustling and oh so charming restaurant like this. \u00c2\u00a0It's a step back in time with history lining the walls in framed photos and culture embodied in the gorgeous chandeliers and artworks. \u00c2\u00a0A classy night out so dress up a bit to feel part of the ambiance. \u00c2\u00a0Service was some of the friendliest we've had anywhere. \u00c2\u00a0Host made excellent suggestions- we enjoyed every dish. \u00c2\u00a0Reservations normally a requisite though we got lucky arriving without because a party had finished early and they graciously accommodated us.","221":"I think we had the \"miss\" here in the hit or miss situation. I was at a work holiday party a few weeks ago and learned my colleague next to me at dinner used to live in Singapore. He told me to eat here and order Buah Keluak Ayam as it would \"change my life.\" I made reservations for dinner which we had last night.When I mentioned to people we were going here, there was a lot of hype. Someone said the chef is a national treasure. The concierge at our hotel said she has not been able to get into the restaurant as a local and was surprised I was able to secure a reservation. The anticipation was really high. Our Chinatown tour guide also shared with us about the Peranakan people and culture to prepare us for Peranakan cuisine.When we arrived, the host expected us, asking, \"Lisa?\" - first he seated us at a table in a high traffic area but we moved to a quiet side space. The restaurant is not very big so that might be why the reservations are hard to get.It turns out my mom was sitting in the same seat Michelle Obama had been sitting in 12 days prior, as the host shared a photograph of her sitting at the table with him shaking Barack Obama's hand. We started with this fried tofu skin stuffed with crab, shrimp, chicken, and water chestnuts. It was kind of like an over-fried shrimp toast, my mom suggested.For our dishes, my mom ordered butter prawns, I got the Buah Keluak Ayam, and Eric R. ordered the beef rendang. The server recommended nasi lemak (coconut rice) for Eric R. and my mom, and jasmine rice for my dish.When the dishes came out, Eric R. was the lucky one. His had a lot of flavor and spice, and we all liked it. His beef was also very tender. My mom's dish was prawns in shell that were not cleaned, with very little flavor, topped with \"egg floss\" which was not mentioned when she asked questions about the dish. The server warned me that the dish I ordered - some people love it and some people do not - but I was adamant that I must see if it will \"change my life.\"The story of the Buah Keluak Ayam is chicken stewed in a sauce with the \"buah keluak,\" a swamp-based \"nut\" that is a poisonous fruit. Only the Peranakan people know how to cook it without killing people. It holds hydrogen cyanide, which has been used in chemical weapons. The Peranakan people scoop out the center of the fruit, ferment it underground in ash for 40 days, and put it back in then boil it to remove the poison.A demitasse spoon was provided to scoop out this nut and mix it with my rice (which was adorned with fried shallots). Then, drizzle some sauce and supposedly, I would have some sort of food nirvana. Unfortunately, the Buah Keluak did not taste like the \"truffle of the swamp\" as I had hoped it would based on my colleague's enthusiasm for the dish.We also were essentially ignored by staff through much of the experience, and with tiny water glasses, we were often without drink. Eric R.'s dish was very spicy so he asked a server to leave a pitcher of waster but the server refused. Eventually, we were served a complimentary warm tapioca cake with palm sugar syrup, coconut milk, and coconut ice cream to cool Eric R.'s mouth and perhaps make up for poor service. The best parts of the meal were the rendang and the dessert. We left a bit disappointed with the experience given all of the hype, but it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try Peranakan food so now we can say we did.","222":"The decor of this place is on point. You can definitely find an instagram moment here. The server who greeted us was very friendly (and handsome). He seated us and then ended up being our server too. It is a pretty small place, but I imagine that he was spread a little thin. He maintained a helpful and friendly vibe throughout the whole meal. And we were there pretty late in the evening. I ordered a drink called a haliatini, which was probably the best drink that I've had since I can remember. The price is pretty standard for Singapore, probably even a little less given that this is a nice restaurant. We ordered the chicken wings and satay to start. Both were excellent. The wings came with this spicy, fishy, sauce. And the peanut sauce with the satay was on another level. For main courses we got the Daging Chabek beef cheeks and the garam assam fish. Both had some much flavor, some spicy heat, and everything else. Very well balanced. \u00c2\u00a0 And all of that was the perfect amount of food for two people who heavily eat.For the price point, this place is worth it. The only negative criticism that I have to say is that the napkins are paper, which kind of makes it feel like it's not as nice as it is. But since this is in a museum, I'm guessing that it's because washing cloth napkins might not be a feasible option. A very small detail and, in the end, who cares? Especially because I recently got yelled at somewhere else (Gaggan) for being too messy on my cloth napkin.","223":"The National Gallery is a treat to be walking around and even more so when you find yourself in a gastronomic beckoning called \"The National Kitchen\" - black panels with gold trims and a strangely harmonious cacophonyof floor tiles, the atmosphere is elegantly Singaporean. The black leather upholstered seats however is in a sad state of disrepair and really needs to be replaced. The back of my thighs were constantly reminded of how beat up they are. Food - good. End of story. Solid mustard green duck soup just right amount of sour. Kueh pie tee is a generous helping - 9 altogether unlike Candlenut with its skimpy 4. And of course I showed up for the buah keluak noodles (could have sworn this was called buah keluak spaghetti at the bt Timah branch) and it didn't disappoint. Noodles was al dente and buah keluak sufficient. There was an undertone of coconut milk. Solid service.","224":"Nice, old-school classy restaurant.

High Tea at National Kitchen is a great experience and at a very reasonable price point. Service was exceptional, every item was explained in depth. The waiter let us try three different teas - all of which were world class. This place has both great style and food quality. Recommend making reservations, even if the same day.","235":"It's a very busy place, so I thought it must be good. Ordered baked lobster, not as good as it should be. When it came up, it was lukewarm and a bit tough to chew. Full of senior citizens, not sure why. Think I am the only tourist dumb enough to order lobsters, no one else there did. Salads are very fresh.","236":"When in Singapore \u00c2\u00a0have Peranakan food.We searched out National Kitchen by Violet Oong after learning about the Peranakan during our visit earlier to the National Museum of Singapore nearby (hint: take the guided tour).We weren't sure whether we could get into the National Kitchen without paying for entry to the National Gallery. \u00c2\u00a0Turns out we could. \u00c2\u00a0The guard at the entrance was very helpful in showing us how to get to the restaurant (on the second floor) from the ground floor museum entrance.The dishes were served famiy style which I love since I get a chance to try all the dishes.We had a variety of dishes:Sambal Kimchiam Udang - Lily buds with Prawns \u00c2\u00a0and starfruit.Sambal Petai with Prawns - Stinky Green Bean Fried in Spicy \u00c2\u00a0Dried Prawn Sambal Sauce with Prawns.Dry Med Siam - Rice Noodles \u00c2\u00a0with Mee Siam Chili with Prawns , Bean Curd and Chinese ChivesGaram Assam FishKuay Pie Tee - famous must have. \u00c2\u00a0The brown colored sauce is sweet, the Sambal is spicy. \u00c2\u00a0All delicious! When in Singapore \u00c2\u00a0have Peranakan food!","237":"The food and drinks are quite expensive. Since the restuaurant is inside national gallery, the environment and decoration add points.","238":"I came here TWICE during my stay in Singapore. The food is exquisite.(Duh, it's Violet Oon!)Oh, but let's talk about the decore. Swoon!!! You are instantly transported to 1920's Peranaken wealth. Just. So. Charming. And. Lovely.Afterwards or before be sure to explore the original courts and the beautiful art exhibits throughout the National Gallery.Love. Love. Love the National Kitchen. And if I ever go back to Singapore, I will go back to this beautiful perfect place.","239":"Violet Oon has several restaurant locations throughout Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0This one is located in the City Hall section of the National Gallery. It's not every day that you get to experience dining in a beautiful historic building that houses a stellar art museum. \u00c2\u00a0It felt extravagant to go from viewing an amazing art exhibit, to then dining in a lavishly opulent historic setting. Reservations are a must. \u00c2\u00a0You can dine in the grand hall or on their scenic veranda. The menu is focused on Singaporean Asian influences. \u00c2\u00a0The service was fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0They were very accommodating for those of us in the group with dietary restrictions. \u00c2\u00a0The wine selection for a fancy spot was mediocre. \u00c2\u00a0Stick with the cocktails here. \u00c2\u00a0I was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their food, better than our expectations! \u00c2\u00a0I had the house specialty, the Beef Padang with coconut rice. \u00c2\u00a0I could have eaten the coconut rice by itself. \u00c2\u00a0It was PHENOMENAL!! \u00c2\u00a0The local chicken rice was bland in comparison. \u00c2\u00a0The beef padang paired with the coconut rice was one of my favorite dishes while in Singapore.NOTE: If you are low on fitbit steps, just go to the bathroom a couple of times. It's a trek to the restrooms located in the museum. \u00c2\u00a0It's easy to get lost. \u00c2\u00a0Definitely ask the staff for directions. They will actually walk out a bit with you and point you in the general direction until you find the signs that then lead you to the museum bathrooms in that section of the building.","240":"My brother very thoughtfully got me a gift certificate for this restaurant for my husband and I to go while vacationing in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Unfortunately, we were not super familiar, so there was a misunderstanding in our part about calling ahead with the gift coupon etc. \u00c2\u00a0However, Monica was so professional and nice, she got us reserved for the next night and the food was incredible. \u00c2\u00a0It's totally worth buying this gift certificate for a 4 course meal, it was perfect, and we found ourselves wishing we had time or extra stomachs to try more of the menu! \u00c2\u00a0I'd suggest Coriander Leaf to anyone - the service alone sealed it for us, but the food, drinks and atmosphere were all impressive as well.","241":"Came here for a team dinner and the service was really wonderful. Not rushed, not standoffish, friendly and at just the right paceWe had 4 courses and the food was really delicious ... a lot of variety, even from the amuse bouche to palate cleanser. I only took one photo as we were enjoying the company and food. Bonus, this is located at the same place where the wedding in Crazy Rich Asians was filmed","242":"This review is for a private party \/ cooking event. Twelve of us were divided into 3 teams. We were given a menu and ingredients and cooked\/prepared the meal. The staff did a wonderful job of explaining what needed to be done and keeping the activity fun. \u00c2\u00a0At the end, the meal was delicious and everyone had a great time - including people that don't know how to cook.","243":"Found this really awesome place based on a local friends recommendation. The service is outstanding, and the food is beyond outstanding. I had the lamb chops and my buddy had the young jackfruit. And the watermelon salad - all three were just mouth wateringly delicious.

It offered Pan Asian cuisine with dishes from South Asia, China and Perisa. The restaurant was located at the second level, which both of us took quite sometimes to find the lift to bring us to the floor. The entrance was plain black looking.Although it was noon time, the restaurant was quite dark as it was painted black all over. The brightest areas were the open concept kitchen and the tables by the wall.For restaurant week, the restaurant offered a 4 course lunch set at $28++ per person. There was also a vegetarian lunch set too.The staff could not find the reservation under my name and insisted there was no reservation even although I had showed him my booking conformation email from restaurantweek.sg. Although one could easily spot the customers in the restaurant were mostly under restaurantweek's reservations, he insisted that I had booked under a different website that was not by the restaurant. This made one felt so unwelcome, especially when the restaurant was less than a quarter full. After much exchange, we were showed to a poorly lighted table by the busy kitchen and walkway. I had asked to change to the one of the much well lighted tables by the wall, but was rejected with reason being I did not have a reservation. There was quite a number of unoccupied tables at the time.For the first course, we were servedMarinated prawn salad, grated coconutIt reminded one of the thai style green papaya salad but with a coconut taste.Watermelon, mint, pomegranate, Turkish white cheeseThe sweet juicy watermelon was paired quite well with the strong tasted cheese.For the second course, we were servedSteamed Venus clams, coconut water, tamarindThe clams was small but juicy. The soup tasted quite unusual sweet and lacking of the savoury taste that one was expecting.Spinach parcel, toasted pine nuts, yoghurt, browned butterIt looked like mini sized boiled chinese style dumplings. The skin was not too thick and filling was quite juicy. It was quite unique with the yoghurt.For the main course, we were servedSamia's signature frontier chicken, coriander seeds, chilli, yoghurt cream, arugula and butter naanThe naan was soft and buttery. The chicken was juicy and tasted quite spicy. I wish that there was more yoghurt cream to combat the spicy taste.Charcoal grilled vegetable kebab, butter rice, surmac, mint saladInteresting basmati rice was used for the butter rice. The rice was well cooked although I would prefer a stronger taste of butter in it. The vegetables was juicy with spicy curry powder taste.Lastly for dessert, we were servedCoconut sorbet, roasted pineapple salsa, Don Papa rumThe sorbet did not taste like the usual sorbet. In fact it was more like a rich creamy coconut cream ice cream. The rum did wonders for the simple rich ice cream.Overall the food seem to have more indian influence in it, based on the usage of ingredients and taste. Service was disappointing. There was no refill of plain water. As we were sharing, the staffs failed to take note to serve us serving plates. By the way we were sitting right in front of the open concept kitchen with a row of staffs staring at us.","246":"Welcome to Flavor Town! \u00c2\u00a0Asian tapas, gives you a great opportunity to share a variety of crazy good dishes. \u00c2\u00a0Great wine list and beverage menu as well!","247":"Very nice food.

After a 16 hour flight to Singapore, I was eagerly awaiting my lunch at Burnt Ends. I basically opted out of all the flight food, skipped breakfast, and ended up ordering the Chef's Menu at lunch for Burnt Ends. The outcome? I've never been so full in my life. Since my husband and I decided to let our chefs dictate our menu, I'm not actually sure how many dishes we consumed that were a part of the regular menu.Items that were stellar standouts: any of the beef cuts (cooked to perfection!), the maitake mushroom with egg and rice, the whole crab, and of course, the Sanger. By the time the Sanger showed up, we had consumed 11 dishes beforehand. I wish I had another stomach so that I could have enjoyed the Sanger even more. Getting dessert seemed impossible, but we agreed to try the Marshmallow, and while it was only a bite, it was also delicious.As people have mentioned, this place does require having a reservation, and I know it's tough for folks in the US to secure one with the time difference. We also wanted to sit at the counter, which adds another complexity to procuring a reservation. Keep in mind that you'll also be in close quarters with your neighbors. If I'm in Singapore again, I will definitely come back!","261":"Burnt ends is one of the toughest places to get a seat in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0I had to book months in advance after failing to get a reservation on my other visits to Singapore. It has been consistently ranked in the top 50 Asia restaurants list and went all the way up to number ten this year. I was super excited to finally have a chance to get a table here. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here and had some great food mixed with pretty good food. The pricing is on the high end and definitely expect to pay over SGD per person here. Food: 4.5 starsService: 4.25 starsEnvironment: 4.35 starsOverall: 4.25 starsRecommendations: garlic shoots, tenderloin with bone marrow sauce, jet chicken wingsThe wait staff here was really attentive and my waiter helped me work through the menu. 1st item: smoked quail egg with caviar...nice taste but really not worth the 15 SGD. The caviar didn't really add anything and I wouldn't order this again. 2nd item: smoked jerk chicken wings were really tasty. Two small chicken wings but they were juicy and the lime crema was a nice touch.3rd item: burnt ends Sanger was a really well executed pulled pork sandwich. The black sesame bun was nice soft and well toasted. The cole slaw was well dressed and maintained its crunch and provided a nice texture contrast to the soft pork shoulder. The pork was good for the most part but some parts were a bit on the dry side. 4th item: garlic shoots and gremolata is a must order. The gremolata is delicious and the garlic sprouts were really nice. First time I had this at a non-Chinese restaurant. Highly recommended! 5th item: tenderloin with bone marrow and smoked onion sauce is the signature dish of the restaurant and I can see why. Tenderloin is really one of my least favorite cuts of steak but man oh man is it really good here. Nice and red on the inside without being chewy. That bone marrow and burnt onion sauce is awesome! The side salad also provided some freshness to the dish and made it feel less heavy. \u00c2\u00a0(Must order)6th item: pumpkin pie with marshmallow ice cream. The pumpkin pie has a nice crust and isn't too overly sweet. The ice cream however, has chunks of marshmallows in it which I really didn't like and gave the dish a weird chewy textured. It also made the dessert steer towards the too sweet end. Would try the fog pavolova next time instead.","262":"I get the hype with the experimental drinks and the different types of meat cuts but I just couldn't get into it. The starters we had were: Caviar. Sea bass tacos. Meat toasted. I would come back for the sea bass spread but not so much the meat. There was to on the meat which is what brought me down a loot since 10% of our meat was fat. The caviar was great and even with a teaspoon. I would come back for that. The drink were ok but of you're going out with friends who don't drink then they sadly might have a heard.","263":"It was a night that I will never forget. This was one of those nights where you said \"treat yo self!\" and boy, was I ready to do that at Burnt Ends. This restaurant is the hot ticket - top rankings, great reviews, popular amongst locals and tourists - so, I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to dine at this restaurant. Since I wanted to treat myself, I went and ordered the Chefs Select. The best part of this was that I was able to eat at the chefs counter. Just to sit there and watch every chef showcase their skills and techniques... it was a dream. You get to see the creativity and the innovation behind every dish as it gets prepared. You get to see the quality of the ingredients and the precision of this well oiled team of chefs. I will be honest, there were some moments where you questioned yourself for a bit because some dishes looked way too simple. For example, there was a dish where it looked like a grilled cracker with a crema and topped with a ton of chives. But once you take a bite, your mind is blown. My favorite was their interpretation of steak and potatoes and the leeks with brown butter hazelnuts. These were just the favorites, but I truly loved every dish and wished I had more after every bite. If you are looking for a Michelin Star restaurant with a cool vibe, this one is it! I highly recommend this place to any traveler that is coming through.","264":"I have nothing else to say other than this was an amazing experience. Make sure you get proper seating, the experience can change your meal.Got the beef marmalade. My god, the bbq sauce was warm, tangy, and just perfect. The beef itself was also amazing ofc. We then got the pork shoulder sand which. This had less emphasis on sauce and the meat quality really stood out.We then got a burnt onion steak (100g) and that was good as well. I wouldn't rave home about it, but definitely good.The next star was the ribeye (250g). Wow that quality of meat of amazing. They just add a little salt to it and it was ridiculously good. The pieces that didn't have any salt flakes were disappointing in contrast to the well seasoned parts.Beef marmalade and ribeye were must gets here.","265":"To the Owner: READ, PLS READWow, what an amazing dining experience!!! I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about this place... except... well.. let me get to that part. First, lets talk about what is most important at \"hand.\" FOOD.HOW I GOT IN: I came here early on a Saturday night because this place is booked online, all the way until August. I was told, if you come early, they accept walk ins. (Opens at 6, but come at 530pm) What I didn't know was you would probably have to eat outside. Mind you eating outside in Singapore is not so pleasant because it's so HOT and humid, but I wanted to take my chances. The reviews I got from a couple I met said that this place is far better than most in California, so my palate needed to see what the fuss was about. Anyways, we got lucky and there was a cancellation, and we got to sit inside.SERVICE: It was amazing. The staff there are so nice, helpful and just know what to recommend. They were knowledgeable about the menu and most importantly, they were attentive. From empty water glasses to needing ice cubes, they were on point. I never had to wait to get anyone's attention. Spot on!!FOOD: Loved the Grissini and Taramasalata- Lite, airy with a soft creamy and crispy texture and the little chives gave it an added flavor.Leek, Hazelnut and Brown Butter- Yummy. Not a fan of leeks and the layers it breaks into, but the thin buttery notes with a hazelnut makes a perfect pair.Beef Marmalade and house pickle- YASSS. Sweet, savory, tender, crispy, crunchy, with sour crunchy pickles, OH my! It's like a pull pork but way, way, way better. A definite must try!500g 60 Day Dry Aged Blacksmores Cube Roll (Enough for two if you got all of the above)- BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD, HANDS DOWN. The beef was perfectly marbled and the meat so tender. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly. Still melted in my mouth and the course salt was sprinkled on just right!!!! It also comes with a vinaigrette salad. Perfect to clean your palate in between bites.SO... WHY.. WHY 4 STARS!?!?! HONESTLY, I was torn on whether or not to take a star. Then on my way home, I thought, maybe I should take 2 to get their attention, but the food was too good to give them 3 out of 5. \u00c2\u00a0Anyways, it's so sad that such a wonderful restaurant can be ruined because the owner couldn't put down his phone. During the whole 2 hours I was there, he was texting and surfing social media in between preparing our meals. I was a bit grossed out when I saw that because he touches food with his bare hands, then goes to his phone, and then continues to prepare food. NOT ONCE DID HE WASH HIS HANDS. Do you know how dirty your phone is? We place it everywhere, take it to the restroom, set it on tables and everything else. How often does anyone sanitize their phones? I do pretty often since I work in a hospital but it was soooo disappointing\/disgusting to see that. The owner should be focused on how successful his place is and how happy everyone is enjoying the food he created, not texting. Sadly enough, I was not the only one who noticed. Another woman mentioned it after she finished her meal. I hope he was receptive to that cause I wouldn't want others to experience that.Would I come back, YES but if I saw anyone on their phones while preparing my food, I wouldn't. 400 for a unsanitized meal wouldn't be worth it, no matter how good it is.","266":"I spent a recent Saturday evening having dinner with a couple of friends who live in Singapore and who have been raving about Burnt Ends for years. \u00c2\u00a0Burnt Ends is an amazing restaurant serving grilled meats and seafood prepared over hot charcoal to diners seated along a long bar enjoying the show. \u00c2\u00a0In addition, Burnt Ends offers a wide range of cocktails and a prodigious wine list. \u00c2\u00a0The sommelier is as passionate about wines as any sommelier that I've met, you should take the time to have a chat with him if you are seeking a great bottle of wine.I've included photos of the menu and the dishes that my friends and I had for dinner. \u00c2\u00a0The beef marmalade is a highlight and a must do. \u00c2\u00a0The miso eggplant is an unexpectedly delicious dish that should also be tried. \u00c2\u00a0The steaks that I had were amazing; although I'm sure that anything offered on the menu will be delicious.The most unique pairing of the evening was a jalape\u00c3\u00b1o bourbon shot with a pickle juice back paired with the pulled pork Sanger. \u00c2\u00a0It was delicious!I would be remiss if I didn't mention the amazing service by everyone at Burnt Ends from the hostess to the wait staff to the sommelier. \u00c2\u00a0Burnt Ends is the real deal and a complete package. \u00c2\u00a0It should be on everyone's short list when dining out in Singapore.","267":"This was my first trip to Singapore and I was consumed with trying the local food. I had heard so much about the hawkers. Some of them even have Michelin stars. And of course I had to eat at a couple Peranakan restaurants. So it wasn't until our last night in Singapore that we made it to Burnt Ends. I can honestly say it was the best meal we had in Singapore. They are doing something special at Burnt Ends. The roasted peeks in brown butter, the smoked quail egg with caviar, the steak tartare with caviar on a hash brown, the white pepper chicken necks and the bone marrow bun were all amazing. We didn't even get an entree. The small dishes were good enough. I am looking forward to returning and trying one of their steaks. I also thoroughly enjoyed the slow gin Negroni's. For dessert, the pineapple & rum sabayon was also a nice way to end things. The service staff was cool too. We enjoyed their conversation and they were very informative. Burnt Ends is doing something not many restaurants are doing anywhere in the world. They are deserved of all the accolades they receive.","268":"Burnt Ends is the best place I've eaten in Singapore. The Eel and Bone Marrow bite is one of the best things I've ever eaten.We ate the Chef's Select, which turned out to be almost everything on the menu. This ended up being incredibly expensive (especially with wine, which had a serious - like everywhere else in Singapore - markup), but still worth every penny.Highlights -Sanger was delicious.-Eel and Bone Marrow was phenomenal. You'll never forget eating this.-The crab was fantastic, especially with Sourdough to mop up the sauce.-Burnt Ends chocolate Fondant was special - gooey but burnt and crisp, in the very best way.The Somm was charming, gave us wonderful reccs and even served us a half bottle (when he'd normally only serve a full.) Service was impeccable. An institution, for the best reasons.","269":"Nothing much to add to the reviews here, but this is as amazing as it gets.Get the beef marmalade and bone marrow burger. And of course a steak.","270":"Yum yum and yum. Burnt ends was a fabulous meal in Singapore!We tried making reservations starting a month out, and everything was booked. We were bummmed, but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town. We were able to walk right in with no wait! We were seated at the high top tables, but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well. If you are in town without reservations, I would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it! If you have a choice, go with the table top seating.....you can watch the magic happen. Cocktails were phenomenal (one has burnt sage on top-super fragrant), and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates. The Jacobs Ladder (meat from between the ribs) was fatty and delicious, and had a great mustard sauce. The jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous. The pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor. The king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course, decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers (yum!). We are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in Singapore.","271":"This is one of the most disappointing experiences I've had in Singapore as well as dining at the Worlds's Top 50. When your reservation (that you make 3 months in advance) says \"bar seating\" what they really mean is wall seating. Your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall. When we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for. Fine. Seat us then. Our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini, we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalape\u00c3\u00b1o brine. We tried several starters, Grissinni (simple and tasty), Jerk chicken (pass - it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo) and the Beef Marmalade (which was the best dish we sampled). The Marmalade was delicious. We also tried the Sanger sandwich (while good, it was missing an element of flavor). Maybe some spice could highlight the flavors? And last we were recommended to try the venison. Unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for. I expect more at this price point and for the hype. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere. I would have preferred roasted meat from a Hawker stall.","272":"Very nice Australian Cuisine. Booking is essential. We booked 3 months ahead and managed to only get a \"bar seat\". That means you sit facing the blank wall on a bar stool, not the best for a social outing.The food was good and so was the service. I found it a bit rich. We started off with the Quails egg & caviar, followed by Grissini & Taramasalata. Both good. The Beef Marmalade and Leek, Hazelnut & Truffle were also good. I found the Pulled Pork Burger ordinary. The King Crab and Garlic Brown butter was excellent but rich. The final dish of Onglet was also nice.Over all it was a nice meal although most uncomfortable on a bar stool.","273":"I love dining alone, and this night I happened to walk-in at just the right time to catch one of the last seats available for dinner. It was outside, which was fine as it was a cool March evening. I saw many people being turned away after I sat down. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the miso eggplant, the romaine salad, the steak, and a mint ice cream for dessert. This was a bit too much food for one, I realized late, but it was fabulous! I specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare, which I don't usually do, but it was so, so, so good. The steak comes with a small salad, so the romaine salad was really unnecessary - it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me. The romaine was the least successful of the items, it was strangely salty.  \u00c2\u00a0 Make the time for this place when you're in Singapore!","274":"My favourite restaurant in Singapore. Burnt Ends gets it all right. The meat and seafood will blow your socks off. Dishes that at first appear super simple are, after diving in, deeply complex. This started with snow crab leg in herb butter, roasted leek, eggplant and then moved on to the ' Burnt Ends Sanger' (amazing!) & rump cap. Sounds like a lot for two, but the dishes are small and perfect to share. We finished with the sugar cake and smoked ice cream. The cocktails and wines are phenomenal, but it's the experience and theatre going on in the kitchen as you sit at the bar that seals the deal. Go here. Yeah it's not cheap, but it shouldn't be.","275":"Wow wow. 10\/10. Amazing. Phenomenal. Delicious. Mouth watering. An experience you can't miss. If you don't go, you messed up","276":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here during our visit to Singapore. After reading so much about it prior to our visit in our nerdy tourist book, we felt it is a definite must try! We read many reviews about how difficult it is to get a reservation here. Indeed.. I tried calling a couple times from our hotel and no luck. I think it may be an online reservation only?? Not sure. Anyways, we took our chances on a Wednesday evening to just walk in and hopefully the wait wouldn't be too long. \u00c2\u00a0When we arrived, the hostess said it would be 45 minutes by the bar area against the wall. The bar area by the kitchen is definitely more appealing to the eyes as you can see the chefs and bartender working their magic. The restaurant itself is quite small, so I can understand why it is difficult to get seated here. We strolled around the streets a bit and returned 45 minutes later. There were 5 seats by the bartender vacant at this point, but the hostess said it's reserved. We waited a little longer but the guests by the wall bar were still seated. The hostess then informed us that the party that was to be seated by the bartender canceled, so we got some pretty good seats there! We ordered a couple drinks, and the bartender was a true artist at his craft! Some of the best drinks we've ever had! We ordered 3 appetizers which came out promptly one after the other. Each one was more delicious than the one before! My husband had ordered a steak which came out quite late.. at that point we almost didn't even wait for it. That is why I docked off a star from my review. Sadly we didn't feel that the steak was nearly as special as the appetizers which were truly the star of the dining experience. The lamb tacos and the beef marmalade were our favorites. We also liked the pulled pork sandwich. Nonetheless, the dining experience was truly memorable and I recommend you pay this place a visit. People were complaining about prices in their reviews, but coming from LA, it really wasn't too different, it was actually cheaper than a lot of the fine dining we've had in LA. My advice would be to skip on the steaks and order a bunch of their delicious meat appetizers :)","277":"There are times when you do pay lots for a meal and leaving the place feeling worth every single cents? I would say this is the place. \u00c2\u00a0Every thing from the food, the service and the ambiance was just wonderful. \u00c2\u00a0We were lucky enough to get the seats closes to where the action is. \u00c2\u00a0Seeing how the order comes in, the sou chef calling out the orders, the busy cooks scrambling to get every piece perfect and back to the chef finally taste to serve. \u00c2\u00a0Think there are more than enough reviews already (will just add extremely detail pictures to tempt whose unconvinced to part with their hard earn $$) so i won't say more except the 650G beef though a S$380 hit was the best!!

The day before I checked its website, and was able to make a reservation for its counter seat. As I was one of its first customers of the day, I was able to get the first seat next to the cashier, with a great view of the open kitchen. Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar ($12+)Gone in a mouthful, it was an exciting moment in the mouth, although one could not help feeling that it was quite expensive for an egg.Duck Hearts and Peri Peri ($8+)I was not quite a fan of duck hearts and expecting it to be quite spicy, but it tasted chewy with a hint of spices.Beef Marmalade and Pickles ($14+)Very nice with the freshly cooked marmalade on the toast, but a tab messy to eat.Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20+)Pulled Pork Shoulder, Cole Slaw, Chipotle Aioli, Brioche BunI had this takeaway after looking at most other customers having it. It was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it. Almost could not finished it.Onglet, Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow ($32.10+)I like that the steak was served sliced which made it easy to eat with a fork. I was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted great with the meat.Berry Tart ($12+)It was the dessert item of the day. Served with chantilly cream, although I wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it. Looked simple, it tasted quite good without too tart. I like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite.Overall food was great. Although the counter seats were full, the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal.","279":"I had a great meal here on a Friday evening. I made my mandatory reservation 2 months in advance for a back counter seat. I got lucky when I showed up for my 6pm reservation and was told a seat at the front counter watching the kitchen wasn't needed until 8pm. Score! It was fabulous watching the staff work like a well-oiled machine. I started with a delicious whisky drink and then had the smoked quail egg with caviar. The smokiness was lovely. Then I had the meat marmalade (minus the aioli as I'm not a fan of aioli-yummy!), pork belly with apple and raspberry pur\u00c3\u00a9e (yum!), and the leeks (OMG good!). It was all outstanding! And let me tell you...get the leeks. They were buttery and had hazelnuts and were chargrilled. I still remember what they taste like. Just go and eat some for me.","280":"TAKE ALL MY MONEY! After a 16 hour flight to Singapore, I was eagerly awaiting my lunch at Burnt Ends. I basically opted out of all the flight food, skipped breakfast, and ended up ordering the Chef's Menu at lunch for Burnt Ends. The outcome? I've never been so full in my life. Since my husband and I decided to let our chefs dictate our menu, I'm not actually sure how many dishes we consumed that were a part of the regular menu.Items that were stellar standouts: any of the beef cuts (cooked to perfection!), the maitake mushroom with egg and rice, the whole crab, and of course, the Sanger. By the time the Sanger showed up, we had consumed 11 dishes beforehand. I wish I had another stomach so that I could have enjoyed the Sanger even more. Getting dessert seemed impossible, but we agreed to try the Marshmallow, and while it was only a bite, it was also delicious.As people have mentioned, this place does require having a reservation, and I know it's tough for folks in the US to secure one with the time difference. We also wanted to sit at the counter, which adds another complexity to procuring a reservation. Keep in mind that you'll also be in close quarters with your neighbors. If I'm in Singapore again, I will definitely come back!","281":"Burnt ends is one of the toughest places to get a seat in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0I had to book months in advance after failing to get a reservation on my other visits to Singapore. It has been consistently ranked in the top 50 Asia restaurants list and went all the way up to number ten this year. I was super excited to finally have a chance to get a table here. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here and had some great food mixed with pretty good food. The pricing is on the high end and definitely expect to pay over SGD per person here. Food: 4.5 starsService: 4.25 starsEnvironment: 4.35 starsOverall: 4.25 starsRecommendations: garlic shoots, tenderloin with bone marrow sauce, jet chicken wingsThe wait staff here was really attentive and my waiter helped me work through the menu. 1st item: smoked quail egg with caviar...nice taste but really not worth the 15 SGD. The caviar didn't really add anything and I wouldn't order this again. 2nd item: smoked jerk chicken wings were really tasty. Two small chicken wings but they were juicy and the lime crema was a nice touch.3rd item: burnt ends Sanger was a really well executed pulled pork sandwich. The black sesame bun was nice soft and well toasted. The cole slaw was well dressed and maintained its crunch and provided a nice texture contrast to the soft pork shoulder. The pork was good for the most part but some parts were a bit on the dry side. 4th item: garlic shoots and gremolata is a must order. The gremolata is delicious and the garlic sprouts were really nice. First time I had this at a non-Chinese restaurant. Highly recommended! 5th item: tenderloin with bone marrow and smoked onion sauce is the signature dish of the restaurant and I can see why. Tenderloin is really one of my least favorite cuts of steak but man oh man is it really good here. Nice and red on the inside without being chewy. That bone marrow and burnt onion sauce is awesome! The side salad also provided some freshness to the dish and made it feel less heavy. \u00c2\u00a0(Must order)6th item: pumpkin pie with marshmallow ice cream. The pumpkin pie has a nice crust and isn't too overly sweet. The ice cream however, has chunks of marshmallows in it which I really didn't like and gave the dish a weird chewy textured. It also made the dessert steer towards the too sweet end. Would try the fog pavolova next time instead.","282":"I get the hype with the experimental drinks and the different types of meat cuts but I just couldn't get into it. The starters we had were: Caviar. Sea bass tacos. Meat toasted. I would come back for the sea bass spread but not so much the meat. There was to on the meat which is what brought me down a loot since 10% of our meat was fat. The caviar was great and even with a teaspoon. I would come back for that. The drink were ok but of you're going out with friends who don't drink then they sadly might have a heard.","283":"It was a night that I will never forget. This was one of those nights where you said \"treat yo self!\" and boy, was I ready to do that at Burnt Ends. This restaurant is the hot ticket - top rankings, great reviews, popular amongst locals and tourists - so, I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to dine at this restaurant. Since I wanted to treat myself, I went and ordered the Chefs Select. The best part of this was that I was able to eat at the chefs counter. Just to sit there and watch every chef showcase their skills and techniques... it was a dream. You get to see the creativity and the innovation behind every dish as it gets prepared. You get to see the quality of the ingredients and the precision of this well oiled team of chefs. I will be honest, there were some moments where you questioned yourself for a bit because some dishes looked way too simple. For example, there was a dish where it looked like a grilled cracker with a crema and topped with a ton of chives. But once you take a bite, your mind is blown. My favorite was their interpretation of steak and potatoes and the leeks with brown butter hazelnuts. These were just the favorites, but I truly loved every dish and wished I had more after every bite. If you are looking for a Michelin Star restaurant with a cool vibe, this one is it! I highly recommend this place to any traveler that is coming through.","284":"I have nothing else to say other than this was an amazing experience. Make sure you get proper seating, the experience can change your meal.Got the beef marmalade. My god, the bbq sauce was warm, tangy, and just perfect. The beef itself was also amazing ofc. We then got the pork shoulder sand which. This had less emphasis on sauce and the meat quality really stood out.We then got a burnt onion steak (100g) and that was good as well. I wouldn't rave home about it, but definitely good.The next star was the ribeye (250g). Wow that quality of meat of amazing. They just add a little salt to it and it was ridiculously good. The pieces that didn't have any salt flakes were disappointing in contrast to the well seasoned parts.Beef marmalade and ribeye were must gets here.","285":"To the Owner: READ, PLS READWow, what an amazing dining experience!!! I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about this place... except... well.. let me get to that part. First, lets talk about what is most important at \"hand.\" FOOD.HOW I GOT IN: I came here early on a Saturday night because this place is booked online, all the way until August. I was told, if you come early, they accept walk ins. (Opens at 6, but come at 530pm) What I didn't know was you would probably have to eat outside. Mind you eating outside in Singapore is not so pleasant because it's so HOT and humid, but I wanted to take my chances. The reviews I got from a couple I met said that this place is far better than most in California, so my palate needed to see what the fuss was about. Anyways, we got lucky and there was a cancellation, and we got to sit inside.SERVICE: It was amazing. The staff there are so nice, helpful and just know what to recommend. They were knowledgeable about the menu and most importantly, they were attentive. From empty water glasses to needing ice cubes, they were on point. I never had to wait to get anyone's attention. Spot on!!FOOD: Loved the Grissini and Taramasalata- Lite, airy with a soft creamy and crispy texture and the little chives gave it an added flavor.Leek, Hazelnut and Brown Butter- Yummy. Not a fan of leeks and the layers it breaks into, but the thin buttery notes with a hazelnut makes a perfect pair.Beef Marmalade and house pickle- YASSS. Sweet, savory, tender, crispy, crunchy, with sour crunchy pickles, OH my! It's like a pull pork but way, way, way better. A definite must try!500g 60 Day Dry Aged Blacksmores Cube Roll (Enough for two if you got all of the above)- BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD, HANDS DOWN. The beef was perfectly marbled and the meat so tender. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly. Still melted in my mouth and the course salt was sprinkled on just right!!!! It also comes with a vinaigrette salad. Perfect to clean your palate in between bites.SO... WHY.. WHY 4 STARS!?!?! HONESTLY, I was torn on whether or not to take a star. Then on my way home, I thought, maybe I should take 2 to get their attention, but the food was too good to give them 3 out of 5. \u00c2\u00a0Anyways, it's so sad that such a wonderful restaurant can be ruined because the owner couldn't put down his phone. During the whole 2 hours I was there, he was texting and surfing social media in between preparing our meals. I was a bit grossed out when I saw that because he touches food with his bare hands, then goes to his phone, and then continues to prepare food. NOT ONCE DID HE WASH HIS HANDS. Do you know how dirty your phone is? We place it everywhere, take it to the restroom, set it on tables and everything else. How often does anyone sanitize their phones? I do pretty often since I work in a hospital but it was soooo disappointing\/disgusting to see that. The owner should be focused on how successful his place is and how happy everyone is enjoying the food he created, not texting. Sadly enough, I was not the only one who noticed. Another woman mentioned it after she finished her meal. I hope he was receptive to that cause I wouldn't want others to experience that.Would I come back, YES but if I saw anyone on their phones while preparing my food, I wouldn't. 400 for a unsanitized meal wouldn't be worth it, no matter how good it is.","286":"I spent a recent Saturday evening having dinner with a couple of friends who live in Singapore and who have been raving about Burnt Ends for years. \u00c2\u00a0Burnt Ends is an amazing restaurant serving grilled meats and seafood prepared over hot charcoal to diners seated along a long bar enjoying the show. \u00c2\u00a0In addition, Burnt Ends offers a wide range of cocktails and a prodigious wine list. \u00c2\u00a0The sommelier is as passionate about wines as any sommelier that I've met, you should take the time to have a chat with him if you are seeking a great bottle of wine.I've included photos of the menu and the dishes that my friends and I had for dinner. \u00c2\u00a0The beef marmalade is a highlight and a must do. \u00c2\u00a0The miso eggplant is an unexpectedly delicious dish that should also be tried. \u00c2\u00a0The steaks that I had were amazing; although I'm sure that anything offered on the menu will be delicious.The most unique pairing of the evening was a jalape\u00c3\u00b1o bourbon shot with a pickle juice back paired with the pulled pork Sanger. \u00c2\u00a0It was delicious!I would be remiss if I didn't mention the amazing service by everyone at Burnt Ends from the hostess to the wait staff to the sommelier. \u00c2\u00a0Burnt Ends is the real deal and a complete package. \u00c2\u00a0It should be on everyone's short list when dining out in Singapore.","287":"This was my first trip to Singapore and I was consumed with trying the local food. I had heard so much about the hawkers. Some of them even have Michelin stars. And of course I had to eat at a couple Peranakan restaurants. So it wasn't until our last night in Singapore that we made it to Burnt Ends. I can honestly say it was the best meal we had in Singapore. They are doing something special at Burnt Ends. The roasted peeks in brown butter, the smoked quail egg with caviar, the steak tartare with caviar on a hash brown, the white pepper chicken necks and the bone marrow bun were all amazing. We didn't even get an entree. The small dishes were good enough. I am looking forward to returning and trying one of their steaks. I also thoroughly enjoyed the slow gin Negroni's. For dessert, the pineapple & rum sabayon was also a nice way to end things. The service staff was cool too. We enjoyed their conversation and they were very informative. Burnt Ends is doing something not many restaurants are doing anywhere in the world. They are deserved of all the accolades they receive.","288":"Burnt Ends is the best place I've eaten in Singapore. The Eel and Bone Marrow bite is one of the best things I've ever eaten.We ate the Chef's Select, which turned out to be almost everything on the menu. This ended up being incredibly expensive (especially with wine, which had a serious - like everywhere else in Singapore - markup), but still worth every penny.Highlights -Sanger was delicious.-Eel and Bone Marrow was phenomenal. You'll never forget eating this.-The crab was fantastic, especially with Sourdough to mop up the sauce.-Burnt Ends chocolate Fondant was special - gooey but burnt and crisp, in the very best way.The Somm was charming, gave us wonderful reccs and even served us a half bottle (when he'd normally only serve a full.) Service was impeccable. An institution, for the best reasons.","289":"Nothing much to add to the reviews here, but this is as amazing as it gets.Get the beef marmalade and bone marrow burger. And of course a steak.","290":"Yum yum and yum. Burnt ends was a fabulous meal in Singapore!We tried making reservations starting a month out, and everything was booked. We were bummmed, but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town. We were able to walk right in with no wait! We were seated at the high top tables, but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well. If you are in town without reservations, I would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it! If you have a choice, go with the table top seating.....you can watch the magic happen. Cocktails were phenomenal (one has burnt sage on top-super fragrant), and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates. The Jacobs Ladder (meat from between the ribs) was fatty and delicious, and had a great mustard sauce. The jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous. The pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor. The king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course, decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers (yum!). We are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in Singapore.","291":"This is one of the most disappointing experiences I've had in Singapore as well as dining at the Worlds's Top 50. When your reservation (that you make 3 months in advance) says \"bar seating\" what they really mean is wall seating. Your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall. When we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for. Fine. Seat us then. Our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini, we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalape\u00c3\u00b1o brine. We tried several starters, Grissinni (simple and tasty), Jerk chicken (pass - it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo) and the Beef Marmalade (which was the best dish we sampled). The Marmalade was delicious. We also tried the Sanger sandwich (while good, it was missing an element of flavor). Maybe some spice could highlight the flavors? And last we were recommended to try the venison. Unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for.

I ordered the cha siew & chicken with rice and it KIND OF tasted like what I've already had before. The cha siew and chicken were cooked well, the chicken was tender, and the soy sauce was SWEEEET, so it's a bit different than what I've had; I think honey might be in the marinade recipe. I prefer the cha siew over the chicken because the flavoring was bomb, but the entire meal was very satisfying for me. The reviews here are mixed but I actually enjoy and appreciate simple + affordable foods and that's exactly what Chef Chan's belief is. I'm pretty glad a non-expensive nor fancy fine-dining restaurant like simple Hawker Chan received a Michelin star. It's worth checking out and I don't know why you wouldn't want to spend less than USD$3 for a meal, because honestly, what can that get you especially in America? NOTHING. I personally RECOMMEND!","301":"On my trip to Singapore I was determined to have the famous \"cheapest Michelin star meal\". I wasn't able to locate the original stall in the hawker market until after they sold out, but came to their chain storefront instead to have the faux experience.The chicken itself was fantastic, and extremely flavorful. I could eat that stuff for days.But, the experience overall felt a little bit like they turned the original Hawker Chan into a McDonalds. It's commercial and the food, though tasty, came out a bit cold.I'm still extremely happy I was able to eat here-- because it was extremely tasty-- but the commercialization is a little bit disappointing to me.","302":"Probably one of the cheapest Michelin star meal you can find for $5! Went around lunch time and the place was PACKED...we waited in line for at least half an hr. Trying to find a table? Don't. We ordered the soya chicken with rice, roasted pork with rice, and soy sauce vegetables. As a Cantonese I pretty much grew up eating roasted meats and chicken and I have to say the food quality was underwhelming. The chicken wasn't really tender and actually somewhat dry. Same thing goes with the roasted pork: there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat isn't too dry. You can't beat the price of $5 but honestly there are so many hawkers in Singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options.The seating\/lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space. It was an interesting experience given the chain's fame but honestly I wouldn't be back.","303":"Hawker Chan was my second stop on my quest to find the best chicken rice in Singapore, and I was massively disappointed.We ordered a soya chicken rice, their specialty, and while the chicken was nicely cooked the rice was bland and the sauce did nothing to help the dish. \"Just okay\" is the best description I can provide for how the dish tasted overall. For the cheapest Michelin star meal in the world, I was disappointed. There are so many other things I would rather eat for the same amount of money (around $5 singapore dollars).Not worth the trek.","304":"It's everything I was promised! Probably one of the best meals I've ever had especially when it comes down to about $5 U.S. a meal.- Soya sauce chicken w\/ rice - this must be the tastiest chicken I've ever had, especially their skin. Whatever they marinated would definitely has a Touch of Magic. \u00c2\u00a0Only complaint is that they do it the inexpensive way which is just directly butcher the chicken so you have a lot of Bones to go through 4\/5- char siew hor fun - incredibly flavorful. Hard to be disappointed with such an explosion of flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection - aiyu aloe vera - super super refreshing. The jelly tastes like chrysanthemum with chunks of aloe. I highly recommend getting this with any of their dishes. I think it's the perfect palate cleanser at the end of extremely hearty flavorsAlthough I only have a few days out here, definitely going to make a second stop before I leave. A must & absolutely worth it","305":"The famous hawker chanI was in Singapore and had to stop by I heard they had a Michelin star. I got super lucky when I came in the line was small I waited about 10 minutes to order and got my food 5 minutes after that. I ordered the soya chicken and rice the Michelin star dish, I got it to go because although the line was short the place was packed.The food!!!So to start it had alot of bones, the chicken was cooked well, not dry at all, the flavor was very generic, I tasted the soya sauce and it wasn't anything impressive. I was left a little disappointed, I may have set my expectations too high. Overall it's ok, just ok there's other hawkers some tasting better in my opinion.","306":"Simple food. Expect a line.Have you ever eaten at a Michelin-starred spot for $5? Not only is Singapore a dope vacation destination, but it has cheap, delicious food. With numerous and cheap Michelin-starred restaurants. It's cool that this restaurant is in Chinatown, so you can shop and continue your food journey while in Singapore.After waiting in the line that was literally out the door (roughly 20 minutes), I ordered the soya chicken and rice, which is what gave this place its Michelin star. \u00c2\u00a0When I finally received my food (about 10 minutes later), I struggled for a few minutes finding a table. \u00c2\u00a0This place is packed! Seriously, good luck finding a seat, as people tend to \"save\" them for their multiple person families. Kinda rude, but smart. I will say that the chicken was good, but not very unique and definitely not worth the wait. It was roasted chicken, rice with soya sauce, half a boiled egg, fresh slices of cucumber, and roasted peanuts. Super random items and plating, but I suppose when they are churning out hundreds-plus plates a day they could care less. There are tons of other hawkers that serve the same food and you'll get it in 5 minutes without a wait.Suggestions: \u00c2\u00a0Take your food to go and go sit on a bench or in the food court nearby to eat it. \u00c2\u00a0It'll save you time and energy from wrestling for seats with other foreigners. Or, if you just want to try the dish, go to any hawker stall.","307":"Located on a busy street in Chinatown it is easy to pass right by the unassuming, Michelin star owning, Liao Fan Hawker Chan.Due to the notoriety, we were warned that the line may be long (multiple hours), luckily we went at an off time and therefore did not have it wait. We walked right up to the counter and ordered the famous, chicken and rice. Compared to other dishes we had in the area I found the simplicity of the dish surprising. While the flavors were very subtly the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. I don't think I would wait hours to get the dish again especially since it is a common local dish, but if you've never been and want to experience the \"The Cheapest Michelin-starred Meal In The Word\" I would suggest stopping by.","308":"I had just gone to Maxwell Hawker Center at 10 am to try the Hainan Chicken Rice at Tian Tian, then decided to walk through Chinatown to try the Soya Sauce Chicken at Hawker Chan. \u00c2\u00a0It was a short walk, but I stopped several times to buy souvenirs. \u00c2\u00a0I got to Hawker Chan around 10:45 am, and there were about 6 people waiting in line. \u00c2\u00a0It was early and the restaurant was fairly empty, and the line moved quickly.I had to try their famous soya sauce chicken that won them their Michelin star, and boy was it good! \u00c2\u00a0The skin reminded me of the skin from a roast chicken or duck. \u00c2\u00a0It's better than most of the soya sauce chickens I've had in San Francisco. \u00c2\u00a0The sauce is a mix between savory and sweet. \u00c2\u00a0I feel that most of the soya sauce chickens at home were mostly salty, and one dimensional. \u00c2\u00a0The Hawker Chan chicken was moist and juicy. \u00c2\u00a0Portion size is on the smaller side, but I wasn't too hungry after already eating at Tian Tian about an hour earlier.I also ordered the green papaya with pork ribs soup, fried dumplings, and a Chinese flower tea. \u00c2\u00a0My entire meal came out to $18.80 SGD. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was only $5 SGD (about $3.67 USD in November 2019). \u00c2\u00a0It's insane. \u00c2\u00a0There is no way I could get a chicken rice plate for under $4 in San Francisco, much less at a Michelin star restaurant.Definitely a must-try if you're in Singapore.","309":"I don't know. I didn't get the hype. Chicken rice is extremely bland. I did tons of research prior to our trip to Singapore and this is THE DISH to try but it just did nothing for me. The restaurant is extremely crowded (surely due to the Michelin Star) and you have to stalk a table to sit down. Food is prepared quickly but generally you will need to share a table with a stranger and have someone standing over you waiting for you to finish. It's not worth the hassle in my opinion.

Anytime I get to try something that's both Michelin and cheap, than I do it! \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the signature dish (the Soya Sauce Chicken), which cost 3.68 USD for the entire set. It does not get much cheaper than that.The meal was delicious! I ordered a second dish to eat because it was so tasty. The hor fun noodles and char siew was a great choice as well. I actually preferred the noodles compared to rice after tasting both.Be prepared to wait for a little while because this place is very popular. It can crowded, but I think they did a great job of serving as many people as possible.The Recommendation: This place definitely lives up to its reputation.

I was about to find out. We decided to come here for an early lunch. A long line was forming quickly and I realized the limited amount of available seating. The smart thing to do is stake your claim at one of the tables. Place your shopping bag, purse, umbrella or anything to hold that seat.

My Yelper friend, Jessalyn P., (who came here two months before me) agree that it was our favorite meal while we were in Singapore.

Get the veggies, it's simple yet one of the best I've ever had. I'm going to say that the biggest difference I taste in this chicken is the soy sauce they use. I think that's their secret.

Best part of the meal was the rice noodles (good texture) and papaya soup.","315":"Finally after a few years of being selected as Michelin Star restaurant, I got to try their famous chicken rice.I arrived here 30 minutes before their opening time but a long queue was already there when I arrived. They got really busy within one hour of opening and people came with large group couldn't sit together.My experience on the day I visited was underwhelming. I kept thinking why am I paying $5 for this? It used to be $3 when I tried five years ago. Food now is not as good as it used to be... why did I stand in line so long for this food?Tourists from all over the world came here to experience. It could be a personal preference, I prefer another chicken rice from somewhere else.","316":"Decided to try out Hawker Chan on a short trip to Singapore. Had the soya sauce chicken rice, the roast pork and the char siew. Aside from the char siew, everything else especially the chicken rice was subpar and overrated.

We didn't know that there was more than one location and we just put the name in Grab. The driver informed us that this place is really great. You can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs Chinatown. However, it was 90 degrees outside and thought this was just fine. We wanted to beat the rush and arrived about 10:50am. There were about 10 people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly.The menu is pretty basic, you'll pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles. I went with their famous chicken and rice. The soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier. An order of this dish sets you back about $3.50USD which is absolutely crazy talk. I don't know how they keep it so inexpensive. This is a must visit...but if you want to keep it authentic, head for Chinatown (although I am sure they taste the same).","318":"I mistakenly arrived at this location shortly after 10 a.m. and was surprised to see how beautiful, new, and not crowded this location was. It turns out that this is not the original location. It is built for tourists and serving Coca-Cola in an air conditioning environment ready to accommodate dozens of tourists.I inquired with the order taker whether or not this was the original location \u00c2\u00a0and I found out that the original location is located just across the street and up an escalator, newest store, and then to the left. So, in conclusion, buyer beware as always. In this case, this beautiful looking restaurant is not the original one.","319":"Okay so now that I've actually visited - - it's pretty good but I don't see why it has a Michellin star \u00c2\u00a0Prices are pretty good.

You can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs Chinatown. However, it was 90 degrees outside and thought this was just fine. We wanted to beat the rush and arrived about 10:50am. There were about 10 people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly.The menu is pretty basic, you'll pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles. I went with their famous chicken and rice. The soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier. An order of this dish sets you back about $3.50USD which is absolutely crazy talk. I don't know how they keep it so inexpensive. This is a must visit...but if you want to keep it authentic, head for Chinatown (although I am sure they taste the same).","339":"I mistakenly arrived at this location shortly after 10 a.m. and was surprised to see how beautiful, new, and not crowded this location was. It turns out that this is not the original location. It is built for tourists and serving Coca-Cola in an air conditioning environment ready to accommodate dozens of tourists.I inquired with the order taker whether or not this was the original location \u00c2\u00a0and I found out that the original location is located just across the street and up an escalator, newest store, and then to the left. So, in conclusion, buyer beware as always. In this case, this beautiful looking restaurant is not the original one.","340":"Okay so now that I've actually visited - - it's pretty good but I don't see why it has a Michellin star \u00c2\u00a0Prices are pretty good. It tastes pretty good but the white meat can be a bit dry. \u00c2\u00a0Aiyu jelly is surprisingly good.","341":"Just wanted to comment that N C has no idea what he is talking about. \u00c2\u00a0His review here: yelp.com\/biz\/liao-fan-ho\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.He's just another ignorant white person who can't grasp the idea that the skin, fat, and bone are where all the flavor is. \u00c2\u00a0He's the kind of guy who orders white meat at chicken places.","342":"My go-to place for Xiao Long Bao with my daughter! We love DTF because there are so many outlets and the food is amazing try out their yam xiao Long Bao for yam lovers!","343":"This is my third Din Tai Fung. But I like this one. You know immediately they do a good job on their special dumplings - Xiao Long Bao. The restaurant is at orchard road. Most of the wait time is about 20 minutes. I waited only 17 minutes. As usual, I order the crab Xiao Long Bao. It is soupy and crab egg in it. Very good. The soup here is better than my previous two other locations. I got the shrimp dumplings. It is half moon shape. The only thing I would said is good. Finally I have try one of their specialty. The black truffle Xiao Long Bao. It is rare item. Each piece cost $5 SG. The make of this dumplings is with black truffle. It doe carry plenty soup it it. It has great taste. The food come out quick. Service to the table is attentive. I would said is a way to move the customer to create space for the people who waited.","344":"When you're used to 2-3 hour waits in Los Angeles to eat here and pay much higher prices, it is like heaven eating here in Singapore where you can just walk in, sit down and eat.I can report that 4F here at the Wisma Atria Shopping Center felt to me as if I were in Foodie heaven. \u00c2\u00a0So many choices and in the middle of this chaos of food teasing is Din Tai Fung.We sat down and were promptly served two orders of Xiao Long Bao and felt pacified as the soup explosion in my mouth placed me in a state foodie hypnosis.And that was just the regular order. \u00c2\u00a0We then order the one with truffle flavoring and I felt like Buddha must felt when he found himself in reclining position as he attained Nirvana.Seriously, I really enjoyed the quality here and feel as if I have cheated the entire state of California whole will wait another 2 hours before they can sit down and have about 70% of the quality of XLB that are here.We also had the drunken chicken: simple and excellent.Then for a refreshment, I had the grass jelly drink. \u00c2\u00a0Perfect.Then we had a mushroom and minced pork with noodle dish. \u00c2\u00a0Simple and perfect.All in all, Singapore, when it comes to food is like placing money on bets you will never lose.That's what happened here tonight. \u00c2\u00a0This foodie is one happy man.","345":"Still awesome xiao long bao and fried wontons. \u00c2\u00a0I had the crab xiao long bao and seafood pork fried wontons, very good taste.","346":"Good dim sum, chili crab bao was delicious and so were the xiao long bao and shrimp xiu mai. \u00c2\u00a0Taste is similar to Guangzhou's and Hong Kong's dim sum restaurants.

I think I had dim sum approximately four times during my one-week trip to Singapore and this was definitely the best of all of them. We didn't have to wait too long to get seated, and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down. I honestly don't remember everything we had; I just ate and felt happy. There were a couple highlights though:- Xiaolongbao: delicious. I've often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all. Not the case here. Full of soup, perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar.- Truffle xiaolongbao: If you like super strong truffle flavor, you could probably eat many of these. I could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb I've ever had. - Chili crab bun: What's not to love? Chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun...heavenly. - Fried rice: I could have eaten the whole plate. Enough said. - Chocolate\/red bean dumpling: I have never tried a dessert dumpling before, and I was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling. But it was delicious. The flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty. Be sure to save room for this. Din Tai Fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype.","350":"This Din Tai Fung is located on the 4th floor next to Japan Food Town. Was there on a Saturday for late lunch.

There's outdoor seating for milder weather and indoor seating with A\/C, which is a lifesaver if you're here at the height of summer.The staff are very friendly, and service is pretty fast. Though I will say that I purposely avoided the busiest hours because I wanted more time to sightsee and shop. The food is amazing. I know vindaloo is pretty much the most basic\/boring thing to get at an Indian restaurant, but the mutton vindaloo was probably the best I've had anywhere this far. I like things very spicy, and they matched what I asked for! (Which, as some of you spice lovers know, doesn't always happen everywhere). Their naan was delicious. And the spiced tea (I got it iced) was amazing! Definitely recommended if you're in the area!","385":"\"Probably the best Indian food in Singapore\" is their motto and I'd have to agree. The outdoor\/patio seating was packed at 1am so we were escorted to their upstairs lounge. Looking medieval and historic with brick, I was glad we were able to enjoy a late night dinner in this room. The food was perfect. Enjoyed their Chicken Kebab Masala and Garlic Buttered Naan. Very authentic flavors and wasn't afraid to use my hands to eat! It would have been a perfect experience except for the below average service. We were never greeted and had to flag down servers several times to get them to take a drink order. I wanted to order another dish but never had the change or opportunity to. I would suggest take out or maybe calling ahead to place an order? I would definitely come back here when visiting Little India and if you have an appetite past midnight, they will surely accommodate.","386":"Came here for a late lunch on one of those crazy hot days and so thankful that they have a\/c setup upstairs.It's hard for me to commit to just one dish when it comes to Indian food, so I caved to my cravings and ordered a variety: Rogan Josh, baingan bharta, chicken tikka, biryani, and garlic naan. (Yes, I did eat it all by myself.)Sauce on the Rogan Josh was great, though would've preferred the mutton to be more tender. Paired with the fragrant biryani, that sauce made a killer combo for carb coma afterwards. Garlic naan was incredible as well. Always get it with butter\/ghee. The eggplant was solid, but the sauce from the Rogan Josh stole the show. Chicken tikka was incredibly tender, but thought the season was leaning on the salty side. Left completely satisfied. Will be back soon!","387":"Solid 4.5 stars. Came here for dinner during the week. Was pretty crowded even on a Tuesday, but we managed to get seated pretty quick. It reminds you of restaurants in the 90s in India (in a good way). We got the hara bhara kebab and aloo tikki chaat to start off with. Was very tasty especially the kebab. Had garlic naan and paneer butter masala for mains, again very tasty and very fresh. I was super impressed, and will be back to try their non-veg options soon!","388":"The food was very delicious. The best Indian food I've tried while being in Singapore. The fish tikka masala had just enough spice, the vegetable biryani was flavorful and the honey lemon tea satisfied my quench. I will definitely go back.","389":"Fantastic food, you talk about flavor, this food was cooked just right. We had the chicken masala and the mutton masala. We would definitely have it again. ALSO, so HOT in Singapore, ask to go upstairs in the Air Con part of the restaurant.","390":"I'm in SIN a lot and a freind took me to this place in Little India.Sat on the street corner in red plastic chairs and awaited with a pint of Tiger in hand.The smells emanating form the area are intense, and the waft coming from Khansama is hard to describe. Think Pepe Le Pew floating in the air, hooked on a dreaming scent.The grilled tandoori chicken samples was just amazing.The same 3 cuts of chicken cooked with 3 different spices...one red, one green, one yellow. Green ( whatever the hell it was ) was nuts.The mixed biryani \u00c2\u00a0following was also solid. Mouthwatering.If you want a casual space, easy attitude and scrumptious Indian food, take it for a spin.","391":"I'm a big fan of eating with my hands. Not that you have to they're have forks but when you order roti and stuff it with everything in your reach you really don't have a chance!This food is delectable! We passed by the first time in hope we would find something better maybe and no cigar. We walked right back. The place isn't much to look at they're under construction. The chairs are lawn chairs but who cares I'm here to chow. We had mutton kebab, chicken tandoori, mutton curry, vegetable rice and roti with a side of white sauce. JUST WOW. Spicy, delicious, savory. My mouth is watering I miss it so much. The staff is a little stand off ish but once you get their attention they're incredibly nice. Food is fast we ordered and ate in a half hour bc we had a tour to catch. I honestly will miss this place the most!","392":"Was here for a wonderfully delicious early afternoon lunch, upstairs in air conditioned comfortable dining room. Fantastic menu. Excellent service and great value. Highly recommend!","393":"Found this place via Yelp. \u00c2\u00a0I recommend to sit in the 2nd floor for air conditioning. \u00c2\u00a0This restaurant has outstanding food and service. \u00c2\u00a0The curry mutton was my favorite dish here. \u00c2\u00a0The flavor was very rich, creamy, and extremely flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0We also ordered other foods, and they were also very, very fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0I definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Singapore and want to find some delicious Indian food. But there is a 10% service charge on the bill.","394":"Delicious food! The friendly waiter was patient with me while I stared at their enormous menu and decided on what to get. \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the mutton kebab masala and chicken biryani. \u00c2\u00a0Both were incredibly flavorful and the meat in both were tender. \u00c2\u00a0Way better than most of the Indian restaurants I've had in the U.S. \u00c2\u00a0My only regret is that I came along and I couldn't order as many dishes and I wanted.","395":"This place is in the heart of little India. Just a 5 minute walk off the MRT. Covered outdoor seating makes for a very comfortable experience. The food is fantastic and reasonably priced although I'd recommend a party of more than one. Lunch can be pricey if you want to try more than one dish. \u00c2\u00a0Not complaining at all however, well worth the higher than usual lunch expense. I can't recommend this place more highly. If you find yourself in Singapore, and you like fantastic Indian cuisine, don't skip this place.","396":"You think it's a tourist trap, or maybe it is, but when the food is good I don't care.This place is one of the many Indian restaurants in Little India. It's not easy to stumble into the restaurants if you're not looking for it, albeit the corner location. However, the food was lip-smacking good. We ordered the grilled fish, the mushroom tandoori and the pakora starter and washed everything down with good old Tiger. Shortly said, I was happy with the food!","397":"Deep breath 'TOURIST TRAP, TOURIST TRAP!!!!!'True storyI ordered the koftas $12.50. Pretty pricey but hey this place is meant to be good right? Dish arrived and I thought ' erm here is the sauce, where are the koftas?' Dig around with my fork. Found koftas... - two, yes two. Looking at waiter...'erm there's only two koftas here?!' waiter 'erm that's how we do it, I'll see if I can get some more' Returns with one kofta and cuts it it two - I sh^* you not. Seriously people, do yourself a favour, walk around the back to around the House of Tan Tieng, grab a masala milk for $1.50, a plate of Chenna masala for $1.50 and enjoy the tranquility and food which is heaps better. Hey go crazy, if you spend $5 you will get an absolute feast, or feed the whole family.","398":"The restaurant claims that it's possibly the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. And this is very possibly true. I ordered the Curry Mutton, a low- to medium-spicy lamb dish full of flavor. The meat was tender and the combination of spices very authentic. I would avoid the fancier naans and opt for the plain naan instead. The garlic naan was a bit drier than I had hoped for.","399":"Not usually the biggest Indian food lover but Wow was this place awesome. Just happened to stubble upon the restaurant walking down little India. Everyone ordered something different and we all shared and loved it. Services super nice will come back. Best food in SIN.","400":"Location: This place is located in Little India, Singapore. When I came here around early\/mid April, they were doing construction downstairs, so it wasn't a place I would considered just by looking outside. I came here through Yelp and since I was around the area, thought I'll give it a try. Environment\/Service: I had to go upstairs, since downstairs was constructing (so I was told). If you know Singapore, it gets pretty damn hot. It was pretty hot upstairs and it was poorly ventilated. It's a horrible experience when you're sweating so much, yet trying to consume food. It was pretty busy due to the area being a tourist friendly area, but service was slow and waiters were not attentive. Their chairs are so heavy and huge, which makes it so difficult to even get up to use the bathroom. Food: I tried their chicken curry and their jumbo prawns. The chicken curry was okay, meat was too dry and wasn't really my type of curry (I had Indian food before and it was better). Their jumbo prawns did not look like prawns and rather more like regular shrimps. It was also on the pricier side for mediocre food. Their menu is like a book. A lot of choices, but definitely overwhelming. If I remembered correctly, it was about 30 pages or more!Overall, I give this place two stars. Two stars only because maybe other dishes on the menu could've tasted better, but I wouldn't know. Other than that, service was not great, it was too hot to even move, and our food wasn't that great either.","401":"Khansma delivers and it is oh so good, chicken tikka, samosas, lassis, tandoori Chicken, biryani rice all are so yummy. \u00c2\u00a0Love being able to call up and have this delivered to my place.","402":"Food was EXCELLENT! Service was GREAT! and the restaurant was CLEAN. Recommend chicken tikka masala if you like real spicy and butter milk chocked if you like not so spicy and chicken curry no spicy...and for beers, kingfisher was AWSOME!","403":"Was expecting more since it was a 4 star spot. Got the chicken masala and chicken half kebab. There wasn't any chicken in the chicken masala. Like 2 pieces, and everything else was sauce and green pepper vegetables. Lots of seating and friendly staff.","404":"I hiked about 2 miles from my hotel, through Little India, just to get here and it was so worth the walk! There's outdoor seating for milder weather and indoor seating with A\/C, which is a lifesaver if you're here at the height of summer.The staff are very friendly, and service is pretty fast. Though I will say that I purposely avoided the busiest hours because I wanted more time to sightsee and shop. The food is amazing. I know vindaloo is pretty much the most basic\/boring thing to get at an Indian restaurant, but the mutton vindaloo was probably the best I've had anywhere this far. I like things very spicy, and they matched what I asked for! (Which, as some of you spice lovers know, doesn't always happen everywhere). Their naan was delicious. And the spiced tea (I got it iced) was amazing! Definitely recommended if you're in the area!","405":"\"Probably the best Indian food in Singapore\" is their motto and I'd have to agree. The outdoor\/patio seating was packed at 1am so we were escorted to their upstairs lounge. Looking medieval and historic with brick, I was glad we were able to enjoy a late night dinner in this room. The food was perfect. Enjoyed their Chicken Kebab Masala and Garlic Buttered Naan. Very authentic flavors and wasn't afraid to use my hands to eat! It would have been a perfect experience except for the below average service. We were never greeted and had to flag down servers several times to get them to take a drink order. I wanted to order another dish but never had the change or opportunity to. I would suggest take out or maybe calling ahead to place an order? I would definitely come back here when visiting Little India and if you have an appetite past midnight, they will surely accommodate.","406":"Came here for a late lunch on one of those crazy hot days and so thankful that they have a\/c setup upstairs.It's hard for me to commit to just one dish when it comes to Indian food, so I caved to my cravings and ordered a variety: Rogan Josh, baingan bharta, chicken tikka, biryani, and garlic naan. (Yes, I did eat it all by myself.)Sauce on the Rogan Josh was great, though would've preferred the mutton to be more tender. Paired with the fragrant biryani, that sauce made a killer combo for carb coma afterwards. Garlic naan was incredible as well. Always get it with butter\/ghee. The eggplant was solid, but the sauce from the Rogan Josh stole the show. Chicken tikka was incredibly tender, but thought the season was leaning on the salty side. Left completely satisfied. Will be back soon!","407":"Solid 4.5 stars. Came here for dinner during the week. Was pretty crowded even on a Tuesday, but we managed to get seated pretty quick. It reminds you of restaurants in the 90s in India (in a good way). We got the hara bhara kebab and aloo tikki chaat to start off with. Was very tasty especially the kebab. Had garlic naan and paneer butter masala for mains, again very tasty and very fresh. I was super impressed, and will be back to try their non-veg options soon!","408":"The food was very delicious. The best Indian food I've tried while being in Singapore. The fish tikka masala had just enough spice, the vegetable biryani was flavorful and the honey lemon tea satisfied my quench. I will definitely go back.","409":"Fantastic food, you talk about flavor, this food was cooked just right. We had the chicken masala and the mutton masala. We would definitely have it again. ALSO, so HOT in Singapore, ask to go upstairs in the Air Con part of the restaurant.","410":"I'm in SIN a lot and a freind took me to this place in Little India.Sat on the street corner in red plastic chairs and awaited with a pint of Tiger in hand.The smells emanating form the area are intense, and the waft coming from Khansama is hard to describe. Think Pepe Le Pew floating in the air, hooked on a dreaming scent.The grilled tandoori chicken samples was just amazing.The same 3 cuts of chicken cooked with 3 different spices...one red, one green, one yellow. Green ( whatever the hell it was ) was nuts.The mixed biryani \u00c2\u00a0following was also solid. Mouthwatering.If you want a casual space, easy attitude and scrumptious Indian food, take it for a spin.","411":"I'm a big fan of eating with my hands. Not that you have to they're have forks but when you order roti and stuff it with everything in your reach you really don't have a chance!This food is delectable!

We also had a spicy clam dish and that was equally as tasty. Not like eating at a hawker center, which was a nice break from our food explorations. There was a decent line to wait, but it was 100% worth it.The space was beautiful, and the service was friendly and quite speedy. It was very busy inside so we shared a table with another couple that we did not know. Not expected, but didn't hurt our experience at all.","425":"Seriously the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore!Yes, it will cost you more than a hawker meal, but each part of this dish - the chicken, the ikon billis, the peanuts, coconut rice - is done with attention to \u00c2\u00a0ingredients and preparation.AND, you get to sit inside :)They have recently moved to a larger space, so perhaps the wait lines will be shorter? Nothing to complain about here, just a warning if you are short on time.Enjoy!","426":"When I come to Singapore the thing I crave isn't chicken rice, chili crab, or carrot cake. What I want is a fragrant bowl of coconut rice, a nice fried chicken leg and nasi lemak. \u00c2\u00a0The coconut club delivers a real solid nasi lemak and is definitively worth the wait and the small premium price you pay (12.8 SGD), which is only expensive if you compare to a hawker stall. Food: 4.25 starsService\/environment: 4 stars Value: 4.5 starsOverall: 4.25 starsRecommendations: \"the basic\" nasi lemak, cendol with the read beanThe nasi lemak here hits all the notes that I'm looking for. The chicken has a crispy skin is nice and moist, the rice has a light coconut flavor to it and, and the mix of fried fish\/nuts give some nice added texture and crunch. I have never had cendol before and I'm happy to try it here for the first time. It was really delicious and is a must if you are a coconut fan. The shaved ice is super flavorful and has hints of sweet coconut and coffee. (Highly recommed)","427":"Excellent hearty brunch! Their signature dish, nasi lemak, was on point. Perfectly cooked egg, coconut rice, crispy and juicy chicken with nice selection of sides. Spice up how you like. Also choose from light or dark meat.We also tried the steamed fish cake which was not to our liking. Mackerel in what tasted like a fishy curry sauce, would not order again. Should have tried the shave ice dish everyone was raving over.Worth the wait for a tasty meal!","428":"Nasi lemak is the way to go. Yes, you should end your meal with some chendol, but you are missing out if you don't enjoy the nasi lemak.When you walk in, the open and bright interior welcomes you. The menu is simple and classic. The establishment is modern and trendy. The combination of the two creates this fun, casual, and nostalgic dining experience. Overall, this is a great place to unwind after a long day, catch up with some friends, or as the first stop of your incredible night.","429":"Located in Chinatown not far from the CBD. You have to come here for The Basic - a local Peranakan specialty with coconut rice, chicken, an egg and spices. Also, do not skip dessert - the cendol is a coconut shaved ice with palm sugar on top, so refreshing and not very sweet. There might be a wait but it's worth it.","430":"We spent our day and a half in Singapore going from one place to another: eating, eating, and eating some more. The Coconut Club was recommended by his friend and it was near where we were staying so it was a no brainer for our food itinerary.We showed up a few minutes before opening time and were one of the first to get seated. This place is known for its nasi lemak and so naturally, that's what we ordered. It was divine. It looks so simple on the plate but all the components complemented each other. Based on Yelp, we thought that The Coconut Club would be cash only but that is not the case at all. They accepted all major credit cards, which prevented us from having to run to the ATM.","431":"I must be slacking. This must be my 4th if not my 5th time back at at The Coconut Club for lunch and I have not written a review for it. Maybe subconsciously I don't want to share this place with others. :-)Very popular place for lunch in An Siang Hill. The owner is meticulous about his source of coconut and that is clear when you taste the nasi lemak. \u00c2\u00a0Menu is really simple. One main dish of nasi lemak with 2 pcs of chicken (breast or leg aka light or dark), peanuts, fried anchovies, fried egg sunny side up, crunchy cucumber slices and a spoonful of sambal chili. \u00c2\u00a0Besides the main dish, there are lots of sides like otah and sotong(squid). The main dish is big and I hardly have space for the sides. A good plate of nasi lemak must be fragrant with coconut without tasting like you are eating coconut. Nasi lemak at TCC is very good. I love the chicken pieces. So tender and deliciously marinated with ginger and other spices. Every little side items are fine so well. The ikan bilis (fried anchovies) is crispy. The peanuts are just the right size. Only one thing I'm unhappy about. The side of the plate is too shallow. I kept pushing my food out onto the table. Maybe that's just me. Lots of drinks of local flavors to choose from. Homemade calamansi (lime), homemade barley, bandung (rose syrup with evaporated milk) etc. For dessert try the chendol. It is made with palm sugar and coconut milk. You can have it with it without red beans. Go for the red beans. Today they had a special coconut jelly dessert that is so beautifully done. Looks simple but tasted complex. The jelly is smooth not like agar agar. The coconut meat gave it a nice texture. Small dish big taste (of coconut of course)Definitely a place to visit but be here around 1130-1145. Past that it will fill up and if you have a party of 6, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes.","432":"Small but cute place. Made it at 2:30 pm right before they close. No queue on a weekday. Food came out pretty fast. Service was pretty good for Singapore. Make sure to bring cash just in case their machine is still broken!The traditional teh ($2.50) was good.The iced lemongrass was pretty much ice water with lots of sugar infused with a hint of lemongrass. I found it too sweet and not that flavourful.The nasi lemak ($12) was pretty standard. The rice was not that rich or creamy. More on the dry side I found. Not that flavourful but can still taste the subtle hint of coconut. The sambal was really spicy but alittle sweet. The fried egg was done okay. Runny yolk and not overcooked.The chicken was good with very flavourful batter. I really liked the crunch. It was not dry inside.The sotong ($15) was cooked well. Not tough. Very spicy but delicious.Food overall was good, but as expected in eating out in Singapore, prices were steep.Up to you to decide if it's worth it to pay this much for air conditioning and a cleaner environment compared to the cheaper more traditional hawkers with almost the same quality. Maybe it's nice to experience this just once.","433":"Hadn't realized the restaurant location had moved up the street; was walking in circles before being directed to the correct location. They are located at #26 (not #6), just a 2mins walk up the street. When we finally got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately (2 people at 6:45pm on Tuesday evening). The staff was friendly and approachable. Ordered the nasi Lemak and a side of the chicken satay. You can order your chicken as leg or breast. I went with leg. I enjoyed the meal. I've not had this dish before, so it's difficult to make any comparison. It's a classic dish you can find anywhere and at a cheaper price. But for my first experience. It was enjoyable.","434":"Great reputation - certainly lives up to the billing - though the pricing is appropriate for a trendy spot in Chinatown. \u00c2\u00a0Nasi lemak of course, and great otak otak. \u00c2\u00a0Some delicious desserts too!","435":"I was very disappointed with the service and the clam dish I ordered. I came for a late lunch and half the restaurant was empty but it took a while to get seated and get my order in. The server was very apathetic and obviously didn't want to be there. I figured it was because I looked like a tourist. We ordered Nasi Lemak and a spicy clam dish. Warning, do not order the clams. They served unopened clams and I asked the waitress if it was edible and she just stared blankly and walked away. I didn't want to take the risk because I was on vacation but a quarter of the clams were unopened. Please do no serve food that is inedible. Nasi Lemak was the only good dish here. It is more expensive than any other place. The flavors were unique and the chicken wasn't too dry.","436":"Great place for nasi lemak! It is more expensive (S$12.80) than what you would pay for nasi lemak at other places, but I think it's well worth it for the quality of the food and the pleasant, air-conditioned environment.Food:- Nasi lemak: The restaurant offers this as their only entree, and it doesn't disappoint. The chicken was juicy and tender, while the sambal was delicious with just a bit of a kick. I thought the flavors mixed together very well and I couldn't stop eating it. You can also ask for more rice as well!- Sambal sotong: This dish was basically chopped squid in the sambal sauce. Was a bit pricey and I wasn't a huge fan of the taste, so I would recommend just sticking with the Nasi lemak.Service:I showed up at 7pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty full, but it only took about 10min for us to get a table inside. The waitress was quite funny and also took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. The inside of the restaurant is quite nice and not too crowded, which made for a good dining experience overall.Price: $$Though more expensive that most nasi lemak places, still pretty reasonable at S$12.80 for the basic plate. I found this pretty filling, especially given that you can add more rice.","437":"Overhyped and overpriced. Average rice, chicken portion is big, but taste is ok.Otah is extremely salty! And overpriced (10$ for one)Interior is nice, looks more like an Instagram trendy brunch spot than a place for authentic nasi lemak.Chendol is good though!Long wait time, we came before it opened though so only waited 15min.","438":"Everything is so sub-standard. Rice is not fragrant, chilli not strong nor sweet, \u00c2\u00a0peanut not roasted enough, except chicken is quite nicely fried. Ordered otah and turned up lukewarm. We asked to heat it up, took another 8 mins and still lukewarm. For $12.90 this nasi lemak is not worth the money except if you considered being in aircon room. Most staff has a no smile approach, some even just lazily hang around waiting for the junior staff to do all the work. Too eager to clear and basically hygiene wise, is bad cause the staff just take the tissue from table across my plate where I am still eating. What if something dropped from the tissue then my plate of food is contaminated.","439":"This is my go to place for delicious nasi lemak. The rice is really infused with coconut flavor and is not overly strong. The flavor also does not taste synthetic like some other places. I will suggest to just get the nasi lemak and maybe a lemongrass drink. That is light and refreshing. The nasi lemak comes with sambal (not too sweet or spicy), fried egg with runny yolk (not all the time), cucumber, crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts and two pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken is yummy, the best thing next to the rice. The side dishes are ok, not that special or fantastic to warrant the prices. Same for the desserts. It gets crowded fast, so you will only be seated if everyone is your group is there.","440":"Best Nasi Lemak this side of the causeway. You know those restaurants that do just one dish, but do it phenomenally well? This is one of those places. Runny egg, tender chicken, amazing rich flavourful rice. Each ingredient comes together perfectly on a plate of affordable joy.","441":"Tourist trap, did not get my simple order right. Food was blah. Long lines combined with less than average service landed the club with a single star.","442":"The Coconut Club6 Ann Siang HillSingaporeNasi Lemak in air conditioned shop house.Very good nasi lemak even though I'm not a nasi lemak fan.Ikan bilis are crispy yet not hard. For chicken it is only chicken thigh, no other choice. Comes with sambal.For fish today it is selar fish. It has just the right texture. Not overcooked like it so often is at Hawker stalls. Black sauce with onions and chilli is so good.Kueh salat has a strong taste of I can't quite make out what (coconut?). Not as good as Chalk Farm's.Chendol has a lot of gula melaka. Okay, not great.Ice lemongrass drink. Not nice.","443":"Much-hyped new nasi lemak joint in town. Pretty good, but overall it just felt like something was missing... maybe it lacked a bit of kick. Chicken was great, but the rice could've been a bit more flavourful. Chilli was probably the weak spot here. The chendol came highly recommended as well, but just tasted too sweet as a whole. The homemade jelly was a nice touch though! Service was pretty good... we were lucky to arrive at 1140 and be seated immediately, but come any later and be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait. I think I'll be back, but hope they keep tinkering with the formula!","444":"Had the Nasi Lemak based off a review I read on a blog. SO glad we went and that is what I ordered.

Food: 4.25 starsService\/environment: 4 stars Value: 4.5 starsOverall: 4.25 starsRecommendations: \"the basic\" nasi lemak, cendol with the read beanThe nasi lemak here hits all the notes that I'm looking for. The chicken has a crispy skin is nice and moist, the rice has a light coconut flavor to it and, and the mix of fried fish\/nuts give some nice added texture and crunch. I have never had cendol before and I'm happy to try it here for the first time. It was really delicious and is a must if you are a coconut fan. The shaved ice is super flavorful and has hints of sweet coconut and coffee. (Highly recommed)","447":"Excellent hearty brunch! Their signature dish, nasi lemak, was on point. Perfectly cooked egg, coconut rice, crispy and juicy chicken with nice selection of sides. Spice up how you like. Also choose from light or dark meat.We also tried the steamed fish cake which was not to our liking. Mackerel in what tasted like a fishy curry sauce, would not order again. Should have tried the shave ice dish everyone was raving over.Worth the wait for a tasty meal!","448":"Nasi lemak is the way to go. Yes, you should end your meal with some chendol, but you are missing out if you don't enjoy the nasi lemak.When you walk in, the open and bright interior welcomes you. The menu is simple and classic. The establishment is modern and trendy. The combination of the two creates this fun, casual, and nostalgic dining experience. Overall, this is a great place to unwind after a long day, catch up with some friends, or as the first stop of your incredible night.","449":"Located in Chinatown not far from the CBD. You have to come here for The Basic - a local Peranakan specialty with coconut rice, chicken, an egg and spices. Also, do not skip dessert - the cendol is a coconut shaved ice with palm sugar on top, so refreshing and not very sweet. There might be a wait but it's worth it.","450":"We spent our day and a half in Singapore going from one place to another: eating, eating, and eating some more. The Coconut Club was recommended by his friend and it was near where we were staying so it was a no brainer for our food itinerary.We showed up a few minutes before opening time and were one of the first to get seated. This place is known for its nasi lemak and so naturally, that's what we ordered. It was divine. It looks so simple on the plate but all the components complemented each other. Based on Yelp, we thought that The Coconut Club would be cash only but that is not the case at all. They accepted all major credit cards, which prevented us from having to run to the ATM.","451":"I must be slacking. This must be my 4th if not my 5th time back at at The Coconut Club for lunch and I have not written a review for it. Maybe subconsciously I don't want to share this place with others. :-)Very popular place for lunch in An Siang Hill. The owner is meticulous about his source of coconut and that is clear when you taste the nasi lemak. \u00c2\u00a0Menu is really simple. One main dish of nasi lemak with 2 pcs of chicken (breast or leg aka light or dark), peanuts, fried anchovies, fried egg sunny side up, crunchy cucumber slices and a spoonful of sambal chili. \u00c2\u00a0Besides the main dish, there are lots of sides like otah and sotong(squid). The main dish is big and I hardly have space for the sides. A good plate of nasi lemak must be fragrant with coconut without tasting like you are eating coconut. Nasi lemak at TCC is very good. I love the chicken pieces. So tender and deliciously marinated with ginger and other spices. Every little side items are fine so well. The ikan bilis (fried anchovies) is crispy. The peanuts are just the right size. Only one thing I'm unhappy about. The side of the plate is too shallow. I kept pushing my food out onto the table. Maybe that's just me. Lots of drinks of local flavors to choose from. Homemade calamansi (lime), homemade barley, bandung (rose syrup with evaporated milk) etc. For dessert try the chendol. It is made with palm sugar and coconut milk. You can have it with it without red beans. Go for the red beans. Today they had a special coconut jelly dessert that is so beautifully done. Looks simple but tasted complex. The jelly is smooth not like agar agar. The coconut meat gave it a nice texture. Small dish big taste (of coconut of course)Definitely a place to visit but be here around 1130-1145. Past that it will fill up and if you have a party of 6, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes.","452":"Small but cute place. Made it at 2:30 pm right before they close. No queue on a weekday. Food came out pretty fast. Service was pretty good for Singapore. Make sure to bring cash just in case their machine is still broken!The traditional teh ($2.50) was good.The iced lemongrass was pretty much ice water with lots of sugar infused with a hint of lemongrass. I found it too sweet and not that flavourful.The nasi lemak ($12) was pretty standard. The rice was not that rich or creamy. More on the dry side I found. Not that flavourful but can still taste the subtle hint of coconut. The sambal was really spicy but alittle sweet. The fried egg was done okay. Runny yolk and not overcooked.The chicken was good with very flavourful batter. I really liked the crunch. It was not dry inside.The sotong ($15) was cooked well. Not tough. Very spicy but delicious.Food overall was good, but as expected in eating out in Singapore, prices were steep.Up to you to decide if it's worth it to pay this much for air conditioning and a cleaner environment compared to the cheaper more traditional hawkers with almost the same quality. Maybe it's nice to experience this just once.","453":"Hadn't realized the restaurant location had moved up the street; was walking in circles before being directed to the correct location. They are located at #26 (not #6), just a 2mins walk up the street. When we finally got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately (2 people at 6:45pm on Tuesday evening). The staff was friendly and approachable. Ordered the nasi Lemak and a side of the chicken satay. You can order your chicken as leg or breast. I went with leg. I enjoyed the meal. I've not had this dish before, so it's difficult to make any comparison. It's a classic dish you can find anywhere and at a cheaper price. But for my first experience. It was enjoyable.","454":"Great reputation - certainly lives up to the billing - though the pricing is appropriate for a trendy spot in Chinatown. \u00c2\u00a0Nasi lemak of course, and great otak otak. \u00c2\u00a0Some delicious desserts too!","455":"I was very disappointed with the service and the clam dish I ordered. I came for a late lunch and half the restaurant was empty but it took a while to get seated and get my order in. The server was very apathetic and obviously didn't want to be there. I figured it was because I looked like a tourist. We ordered Nasi Lemak and a spicy clam dish. Warning, do not order the clams. They served unopened clams and I asked the waitress if it was edible and she just stared blankly and walked away. I didn't want to take the risk because I was on vacation but a quarter of the clams were unopened. Please do no serve food that is inedible. Nasi Lemak was the only good dish here. It is more expensive than any other place. The flavors were unique and the chicken wasn't too dry.","456":"Great place for nasi lemak! It is more expensive (S$12.80) than what you would pay for nasi lemak at other places, but I think it's well worth it for the quality of the food and the pleasant, air-conditioned environment.Food:- Nasi lemak: The restaurant offers this as their only entree, and it doesn't disappoint. The chicken was juicy and tender, while the sambal was delicious with just a bit of a kick. I thought the flavors mixed together very well and I couldn't stop eating it. You can also ask for more rice as well!- Sambal sotong: This dish was basically chopped squid in the sambal sauce. Was a bit pricey and I wasn't a huge fan of the taste, so I would recommend just sticking with the Nasi lemak.Service:I showed up at 7pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty full, but it only took about 10min for us to get a table inside. The waitress was quite funny and also took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. The inside of the restaurant is quite nice and not too crowded, which made for a good dining experience overall.Price: $$Though more expensive that most nasi lemak places, still pretty reasonable at S$12.80 for the basic plate. I found this pretty filling, especially given that you can add more rice.","457":"Overhyped and overpriced. Average rice, chicken portion is big, but taste is ok.Otah is extremely salty! And overpriced (10$ for one)Interior is nice, looks more like an Instagram trendy brunch spot than a place for authentic nasi lemak.Chendol is good though!Long wait time, we came before it opened though so only waited 15min.","458":"Everything is so sub-standard. Rice is not fragrant, chilli not strong nor sweet, \u00c2\u00a0peanut not roasted enough, except chicken is quite nicely fried. Ordered otah and turned up lukewarm. We asked to heat it up, took another 8 mins and still lukewarm. For $12.90 this nasi lemak is not worth the money except if you considered being in aircon room. Most staff has a no smile approach, some even just lazily hang around waiting for the junior staff to do all the work. Too eager to clear and basically hygiene wise, is bad cause the staff just take the tissue from table across my plate where I am still eating. What if something dropped from the tissue then my plate of food is contaminated.","459":"This is my go to place for delicious nasi lemak. The rice is really infused with coconut flavor and is not overly strong. The flavor also does not taste synthetic like some other places. I will suggest to just get the nasi lemak and maybe a lemongrass drink. That is light and refreshing. The nasi lemak comes with sambal (not too sweet or spicy), fried egg with runny yolk (not all the time), cucumber, crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts and two pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken is yummy, the best thing next to the rice. The side dishes are ok, not that special or fantastic to warrant the prices. Same for the desserts. It gets crowded fast, so you will only be seated if everyone is your group is there.","460":"Best Nasi Lemak this side of the causeway. You know those restaurants that do just one dish, but do it phenomenally well? This is one of those places. Runny egg, tender chicken, amazing rich flavourful rice. Each ingredient comes together perfectly on a plate of affordable joy.","461":"Tourist trap, did not get my simple order right. Food was blah. Long lines combined with less than average service landed the club with a single star.","462":"The Coconut Club6 Ann Siang HillSingaporeNasi Lemak in air conditioned shop house.Very good nasi lemak even though I'm not a nasi lemak fan.Ikan bilis are crispy yet not hard. For chicken it is only chicken thigh, no other choice. Comes with sambal.For fish today it is selar fish. It has just the right texture. Not overcooked like it so often is at Hawker stalls. Black sauce with onions and chilli is so good.Kueh salat has a strong taste of I can't quite make out what (coconut?). Not as good as Chalk Farm's.Chendol has a lot of gula melaka. Okay, not great.Ice lemongrass drink. Not nice.","463":"Much-hyped new nasi lemak joint in town. Pretty good, but overall it just felt like something was missing... maybe it lacked a bit of kick. Chicken was great, but the rice could've been a bit more flavourful. Chilli was probably the weak spot here. The chendol came highly recommended as well, but just tasted too sweet as a whole. The homemade jelly was a nice touch though! Service was pretty good... we were lucky to arrive at 1140 and be seated immediately, but come any later and be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait. I think I'll be back, but hope they keep tinkering with the formula!","464":"Well, Yelp never lets me down. Came to Vatos for dinner after needing a break from hawker stalls so I browsed Yelp and that's where we ended up.My bf and I shared 3 orders of two tacos each- the beef brisket, pork belly, and fish tacos. They were all very delicious and although the taco tortilla appeared small, they were stacked to the sky with protein. It's not a very traditional Mexican place- because those places usually do two tortillas per taco, but I enjoyed these tacos thoroughly and I would come back if I ever visited Singapore again!","465":"This place is stashed away in the dip but conveniently located in the Beach Road complex which is a Beautiful creation and area to stay and play in. We were greeted promptly and seated promptly. The menu was easy to read and the space is great as well as the music and shall I say the entertainment which I deemed as entertaining by way of the chef cooking and dancing to \"Despasito\" he had tons of rhythm. Once I dig into the menu I was so excited to see that they had Vegan options. My Vegan tacos were super yummy, my husband had shrimp and chicken tacos which he loved. Our son had cheese quesadilla and he ate it all. My sister in law had shrimp tacos with pico on the side. She enjoyed, we all were very fond of the House chip and dip as it was fresh and the red sauce was super flavorful and my favorite of the two provided as we received a green sauce as well that our toddler liked since it was not as spicy. This place is a must do when in Singapore especially if you are a VIP member of my travel club as we earn travel upon paying our tab. WIN WIN WIN","466":"Who knew I would be drinking a beer from Northern California Brewery eating Asian\/Mexican fusion food in Singapore? I thought it was awesome they had Lost Coast Brewery's stout as a beer option here. If I'm going to pay Singapore prices for alcohol, might as well be a craft beer, right? The Korean Po'boy was pretty filling. Loved the house chips here. Pretty huge but with the green was bomb.","467":"Ugh, it's just about average. Food can be a little dry and staff pretty disengaged. Quite loud inside, really hard to hold a conversation.","468":"Vatos Urban Tacos knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to authentic Mexican tacos!I gotta say that I was a little hesitant to go for tacos in Singapore. I mean, if I sometimes can't find good tacos in the USA, which is just north of the border from Mexico. How was I going to find real tacos in Singapore? ...But I was WRONG! Obviously not all of their menu is authentic Mexican; they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of Mexican with Korean and other styles. To keep it traditional, we order the Tacos de Carne Asada and to try something new had the Tacos de Pollo con Kimchi. The carne asada tacos were legit!!!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, the red salsa was spicy and delicious, and the tortilla was made to perfection. The carne asada tacos definitely made me think about my hometown of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. The Kimchi Chicken tacos, were also really good and fresh, but I gotta say they were a little too oily for my taste, and could barely taste the chicken. It was definitely something I had never tried before and I actually kind of like it.Also, we were here on a Tuesday and they had a deal of 3 tacos for the price of 2 (#WINNING).","469":"Good for Americans who need a taste of home while on vacation. The service was good and the food was better. The menu needs to state all ingredients. We had a vegan with us who requested the vegetable burrito bowl and asked for the crema to be left off. \u00c2\u00a0It does not say there is cheese on it, but it came with cheese. \u00c2\u00a0When we explained the person was vegan, they immediately fixed it. \u00c2\u00a0They were apologetic and fixed it with no issues. \u00c2\u00a0Their nachos are some of the best!","470":"The food was average, the staff were lacklustre and I left thinking the place was run like it did not matter that you've paid a fair bit for a good night out. Worse of all, no one else seemed to care that they were paying high prices for really average food and service. Not a good investment in a night out. Compared to Mexican restaurants in LA or Vegas, this was pale in comparison.","471":"As a California native I can assure you the food is on point. \u00c2\u00a0While visiting Singapore with my family, we visited Vatos on a whim (Mexican food in Southeast Asia?!?). \u00c2\u00a0It was incredible! \u00c2\u00a0The guacamole and OG margarita were excellent. \u00c2\u00a0No bottled mix here, just tons of fresh lime juice. \u00c2\u00a0The Korean fusion elevates traditional Mexican dishes to a whole new level. \u00c2\u00a0You have got to try the Kimchi carnitas fries, they are out of this world! \u00c2\u00a0The Fat Bastard burrito bowl lives up to it's name, it is ginormous (but very tasty). \u00c2\u00a0Loved the addition of a crispy cheese layer to the quesadilla. \u00c2\u00a0A note to another reviewer,freshly made corn tortillas are supposed to be thin. \u00c2\u00a0I'm sorry we were too full for dessert. \u00c2\u00a0The place was busy (and as others have noted loud), but the service was good. \u00c2\u00a0Overall I would highly recommend.","472":"Awesome place, great fusion tacos, loved the Korean Galbi tacos and the Shrimp tacos were incredible. Will definitely be back. I wish there were 6 stars.","473":"First things first: don't be alarmed when your party's food does not arrive at the same time. The plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen. You'll see this throughout Singapore. Vatos Tacos is a delightful Mexican\/Korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles (sorry, couldn't help myself) and rice you'll consume whilst in Singapore. \"Chips\" (more accurately, tortillas) and salsa are complimentary with your visit. What I Got and What I Thought:1. Chimichurri Chicken Urban Taco \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 DELICIOUS. Would absolutely have this again. The chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the \"spicy\" chicken. While it did have a nice kick to it, I finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips. As long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden. If you're interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it, but you're worried about spice, just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for. 2. Honey Tequila Chicken Wings  \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table. As you could surmise from the name of the dish, the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet, but they do come covered in slices of chilies. The heat-fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies (this is a simple task). Vegan and vegetarian options are available!","474":"Good food nice environment great selection almost to much to choose from. Only service was lacking a bit with plenty of staff they could have gotten us to order a few more margaritas had they only asked and never asked us we wanted desert by the time we got the bill we didn't.","475":"Mexican food in Singapore? Yes absolutely Yes! If it's what your craving \u00c2\u00a0this is the place. Chips and salsa. Drinks and the food is good. Loved the salsa.","476":"First night in Singapore and fou d this hidden gem. It needs to be on your must try list!! Chimichuri street tacos with enough heat to numb your lips but filled with so much flavor, you won't stop eating!","477":"Long story short. $30 for a margarita is insane. Go somewhere else for a drink. Only go on Taco Tuesday to get 3 tacos for the price of 2 at $12. Service could be improved greatly. I waited at least 15 mins to place my order. The barbacoa tacos were delicious, but I won't be back.","478":"The place was having Korean-Mexican-Filipino Thanksgiving party with Iskina Cebu. The place was packed but lucky I had made a reservation in advance. We were showed to a high chair table by side. The place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining.Chimichurri Lechon Tacos (S$15++\/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu lechon, chimichurri salsa.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o Pork Belly Lechon Tacos (S$15++\/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu pork belly lechon, pickled onions, jalape\u00c3\u00b1os relish.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. I'm Rick James, Peach! (S$30++)Frozen Peach margarita + Tecate BeerThe margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down. It was not too sweet. Oh man I was red like a peach after having the drink. Didn't get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order.","479":"Reservations highly suggested. We came on a random Tuesday night and this place was packed. Since we came all this way, we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for \"take-away\". Luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between 30 minutes to 2 hours. Judging from the crowd, anticipation filled our hungry souls. The menu isn't extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order. We looked at the menu for a good 10 minutes before we decided on what to order. Dinner- all of us got the Fat Bastard burrito bowl. This was our favorite thing here. My colleagues and I couldn't stop raving about it. The rice, the sour cream, the beans, the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed. The kimchi fries were pretty good; the kimchi had a kick and I loved the jalape\u00c3\u00b1os. The fries seemed to come out of a bag though...The galbi no rice burrito I had the following day for lunch was packed. The galbi was tender and let's just say that it was too good to eat just half of it. I loved how tender yet firm the black beans are. The sauces that it came w\/ only elevated the overall taste. No sauce needed. Craving a burrito bowl now!!!","480":"Traveling alone on business with a free day in Singapore. After visiting the national museum I decided to stop here for lunch. Street tacos are pretty common back in the US, and this looked intriguing. I will admit, the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but I thought I'd give it a shot. While I really wanted this to be good, there were several \u00c2\u00a0negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum. So if you're a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos, you're out of luck. It's only \u00c2\u00a03 of one type or \u00c2\u00a04 of two types, etc \u00c2\u00a0 No big deal if you're dining with friends, but cut me some slack. I'm a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you \u00c2\u00a0wouldn't do it even with a \u00c2\u00a0polite request to make an exception. So I ordered 3 pork barbecoa and they were delicious. \u00c2\u00a0So delicious, I was wishing I could have tried some others. The \"Cowboy Queso\" on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it's as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl. So we're batting 50 50 on food quality.Then there's the service. Kind of disinterested and bothered would he how I would describe it. Ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed. My server never showed again either and I had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go.It's a pretty nice place and the one taco I tried was delicious, but beyond that, there's not much to recommend here and given the negatives, I'm not sure I would come back. So much excellent food in Singapore, so lots of other options.","481":"This place is just mediocre. The food isn't as flavorful as it should be, it's overpriced, and the service is poor.","482":"So where do I begin? Opened about a month ago, Vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and\/or drinks. The margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer\/cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass. As for the food, for me it's not something new and exciting. Roy Choi started the whole Korean taco theme in Los Angeles circa 2008, and it's been duplicated around the world. I'm still looking for \"the\" place in SG that serves up the Tex-Mex\/Cali-Mex versions that my palate is familiar with. Don't get me wrong, Vatos is a great choice for asian-influenced Mexican street food. The tacos were, how do I put it? ... tasty but unsubstantial. Maybe I'm jaded by being from California, but ~$12++ for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey. The homemade tortillas were good but a little thin. The flavors were a mash-up of Mexican and Korean, which I enjoyed. The Kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty. Don't know if the fries were salted, hopefully not, because the kimchi, cheese, and carnitas were already sodium loaded. Would come back again because there are things on the menu I still want to try. Mucho gusto.","483":"Finally made it for taco Tuesday!Four of us ordered the happy hour kimchi carnitas fries and 4 types of tacos.Kimchi carnitas fries - 3.5 starsGreat dish to share but we all didn't remember there was kimchi till halfway through. Perhaps there wasn't much kimchi in it to begin with.Galbi beef taco - 4 starsThis was my favorite! We gathered that it was slightly sweet, so those who weren't fond of sweet mains picked the prawn one as their favorite.Chili and lime prawn taco - 4 starsThis was my second favorite - the prawns were fried well and still crisp, warm and flavorful when I had them.Fish taco - 2.5 starsI don't know if it's because I had this after the prawn taco that by then it had gotten way too soggy and the breading was too thick and just tasted like oil. Granted there was a decent amount of fish in it.Carne asada taco - 2 starsToo spicy for all of us! Not much flavor I remember.$96 for 4 of us so that's a very decent $24 each. And I'm still full the morning after... does this make me 3-taco girl? D: not sure I'm dying to go back though. I guess I'd have to try their burritos. A bit noisy for dinner conversation and I'm getting to the age where I don't like yelling over the dinner table anymore...","484":"Well, Yelp never lets me down.

Compared to Mexican restaurants in LA or Vegas, this was pale in comparison.","491":"As a California native I can assure you the food is on point. \u00c2\u00a0While visiting Singapore with my family, we visited Vatos on a whim (Mexican food in Southeast Asia?!?). \u00c2\u00a0It was incredible! \u00c2\u00a0The guacamole and OG margarita were excellent. \u00c2\u00a0No bottled mix here, just tons of fresh lime juice. \u00c2\u00a0The Korean fusion elevates traditional Mexican dishes to a whole new level. \u00c2\u00a0You have got to try the Kimchi carnitas fries, they are out of this world! \u00c2\u00a0The Fat Bastard burrito bowl lives up to it's name, it is ginormous (but very tasty). \u00c2\u00a0Loved the addition of a crispy cheese layer to the quesadilla. \u00c2\u00a0A note to another reviewer,freshly made corn tortillas are supposed to be thin. \u00c2\u00a0I'm sorry we were too full for dessert. \u00c2\u00a0The place was busy (and as others have noted loud), but the service was good. \u00c2\u00a0Overall I would highly recommend.","492":"Awesome place, great fusion tacos, loved the Korean Galbi tacos and the Shrimp tacos were incredible. Will definitely be back. I wish there were 6 stars.","493":"First things first: don't be alarmed when your party's food does not arrive at the same time. The plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen. You'll see this throughout Singapore. Vatos Tacos is a delightful Mexican\/Korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles (sorry, couldn't help myself) and rice you'll consume whilst in Singapore. \"Chips\" (more accurately, tortillas) and salsa are complimentary with your visit. What I Got and What I Thought:1. Chimichurri Chicken Urban Taco \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 DELICIOUS. Would absolutely have this again. The chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the \"spicy\" chicken. While it did have a nice kick to it, I finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips. As long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden. If you're interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it, but you're worried about spice, just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for. 2. Honey Tequila Chicken Wings  \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table. As you could surmise from the name of the dish, the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet, but they do come covered in slices of chilies. The heat-fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies (this is a simple task). Vegan and vegetarian options are available!","494":"Good food nice environment great selection almost to much to choose from. Only service was lacking a bit with plenty of staff they could have gotten us to order a few more margaritas had they only asked and never asked us we wanted desert by the time we got the bill we didn't.","495":"Mexican food in Singapore? Yes absolutely Yes! If it's what your craving \u00c2\u00a0this is the place. Chips and salsa. Drinks and the food is good. Loved the salsa.","496":"First night in Singapore and fou d this hidden gem. It needs to be on your must try list!! Chimichuri street tacos with enough heat to numb your lips but filled with so much flavor, you won't stop eating!","497":"Long story short. $30 for a margarita is insane. Go somewhere else for a drink. Only go on Taco Tuesday to get 3 tacos for the price of 2 at $12. Service could be improved greatly. I waited at least 15 mins to place my order. The barbacoa tacos were delicious, but I won't be back.","498":"The place was having Korean-Mexican-Filipino Thanksgiving party with Iskina Cebu. The place was packed but lucky I had made a reservation in advance. We were showed to a high chair table by side. The place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining.Chimichurri Lechon Tacos (S$15++\/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu lechon, chimichurri salsa.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o Pork Belly Lechon Tacos (S$15++\/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu pork belly lechon, pickled onions, jalape\u00c3\u00b1os relish.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. I'm Rick James, Peach! (S$30++)Frozen Peach margarita + Tecate BeerThe margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down. It was not too sweet. Oh man I was red like a peach after having the drink. Didn't get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order.","499":"Reservations highly suggested. We came on a random Tuesday night and this place was packed. Since we came all this way, we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for \"take-away\". Luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between 30 minutes to 2 hours. Judging from the crowd, anticipation filled our hungry souls. The menu isn't extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order. We looked at the menu for a good 10 minutes before we decided on what to order. Dinner- all of us got the Fat Bastard burrito bowl. This was our favorite thing here. My colleagues and I couldn't stop raving about it. The rice, the sour cream, the beans, the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed. The kimchi fries were pretty good; the kimchi had a kick and I loved the jalape\u00c3\u00b1os. The fries seemed to come out of a bag though...The galbi no rice burrito I had the following day for lunch was packed. The galbi was tender and let's just say that it was too good to eat just half of it. I loved how tender yet firm the black beans are. The sauces that it came w\/ only elevated the overall taste. No sauce needed. Craving a burrito bowl now!!!","500":"Traveling alone on business with a free day in Singapore. After visiting the national museum I decided to stop here for lunch. Street tacos are pretty common back in the US, and this looked intriguing. I will admit, the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but I thought I'd give it a shot. While I really wanted this to be good, there were several \u00c2\u00a0negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum. So if you're a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos, you're out of luck. It's only \u00c2\u00a03 of one type or \u00c2\u00a04 of two types, etc \u00c2\u00a0 No big deal if you're dining with friends, but cut me some slack. I'm a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you \u00c2\u00a0wouldn't do it even with a \u00c2\u00a0polite request to make an exception. So I ordered 3 pork barbecoa and they were delicious. \u00c2\u00a0So delicious, I was wishing I could have tried some others. The \"Cowboy Queso\" on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it's as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl. So we're batting 50 50 on food quality.Then there's the service. Kind of disinterested and bothered would he how I would describe it. Ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed. My server never showed again either and I had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go.It's a pretty nice place and the one taco I tried was delicious, but beyond that, there's not much to recommend here and given the negatives, I'm not sure I would come back. So much excellent food in Singapore, so lots of other options.","501":"This place is just mediocre. The food isn't as flavorful as it should be, it's overpriced, and the service is poor.","502":"So where do I begin? Opened about a month ago, Vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and\/or drinks. The margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer\/cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass. As for the food, for me it's not something new and exciting. Roy Choi started the whole Korean taco theme in Los Angeles circa 2008, and it's been duplicated around the world. I'm still looking for \"the\" place in SG that serves up the Tex-Mex\/Cali-Mex versions that my palate is familiar with. Don't get me wrong, Vatos is a great choice for asian-influenced Mexican street food. The tacos were, how do I put it? ... tasty but unsubstantial. Maybe I'm jaded by being from California, but ~$12++ for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey. The homemade tortillas were good but a little thin. The flavors were a mash-up of Mexican and Korean, which I enjoyed. The Kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty. Don't know if the fries were salted, hopefully not, because the kimchi, cheese, and carnitas were already sodium loaded. Would come back again because there are things on the menu I still want to try. Mucho gusto.","503":"Finally made it for taco Tuesday!Four of us ordered the happy hour kimchi carnitas fries and 4 types of tacos.Kimchi carnitas fries - 3.5 starsGreat dish to share but we all didn't remember there was kimchi till halfway through. Perhaps there wasn't much kimchi in it to begin with.Galbi beef taco - 4 starsThis was my favorite! We gathered that it was slightly sweet, so those who weren't fond of sweet mains picked the prawn one as their favorite.Chili and lime prawn taco - 4 starsThis was my second favorite - the prawns were fried well and still crisp, warm and flavorful when I had them.Fish taco - 2.5 starsI don't know if it's because I had this after the prawn taco that by then it had gotten way too soggy and the breading was too thick and just tasted like oil. Granted there was a decent amount of fish in it.Carne asada taco - 2 starsToo spicy for all of us! Not much flavor I remember.$96 for 4 of us so that's a very decent $24 each. And I'm still full the morning after... does this make me 3-taco girl? D: not sure I'm dying to go back though. I guess I'd have to try their burritos. A bit noisy for dinner conversation and I'm getting to the age where I don't like yelling over the dinner table anymore...","504":"Great food and excellent decor. Definitely should check it out.There's not a lot else to write, but I have to fill space so here's some words. Please dont moderate me yelp!","505":"Came here for the lunch tasting menu since it was a bit cheaper than dinner.Coming in here they start you off with some bread and nicely whipped butter. Need less to say that it was amazing. The tasting menu consisted of Amuse bouche, carabinero prawns, New Zealand Blue Cod (crispy scales), Wagyu beef cheek, Japanese chestnut. The amuse bouche that was served to us was a leech bubble bursting with a delicate cold sweetness and a shrimp cracker with some roe. The former is a little bit sweeter but then the latter is more savory, so definitely eat in that order. We then had these prawns and wow that was amazing. The spot prawns were cooked sashimi style and served in this amazing bed of fruits and vegetables. It was such a light dish that had so much going on (sweetness, acidic, multiple textures) and I loved this dish. I found myself finishing all the dressing as well since it was just so perfect and really maximized the freshness of the spot prawns. It came with some squid ink rice crackers so really let you get a very delectable bite.Next come the entrees, and IMO the absolute star of the show: the cod with fried skin. They leave the scales on and deep fry that!!!! I have never had this in my life, but omg if this wasn't the best cod I've had in my life. Step one, the meat is obviously cooked to perfection. Not too tough as to be overcooked, and not too soft where it's a bit raw, just perfect. But that is tablestakes, the jewel was the skin. The scales all popped up and was sprinkled with a generous amount of sea salt and a bite into the skin just felt like you were tasting this fish straight from the ocean with all it's saltiness. It was amazing. The texture was so crispy and it didn't leak to the tender meat below. The beef wagyu cheek was probably the best cheek I've had. That being said though, I'm not sure if I love cheek that much. The texture of cheek is traditionally chewy, and here it was fattier and much more tender than I'm used to. It almost tasted like other parts of wagyu (flank for example), but I would've just preferred normal ribeye wagyu. I appreciate the quality and skill here and I feel it's like showcasing a more forgotten piece of steak, I would just rather have the wagyu ribeye though.The dessert left a little to be desired. There was some alchohol flavor in the sauce and the dish was good, just nothing too special here. All in all, it was a great meal and came out to be S$230 after tip and taxes for two. I think the price point is pretty spot on and I would come back. It's not a bargain by any means, but not a rip off either.","506":"I tried the chef's choice 5 meal courses for S$158.00. It was very beautiful sophisticated presentation. Wagyu dishes was over flavored. Don't really taste wagyu itself flavor. Black truffle was on the one of the dishes. When I bite it, I expect to smell the great fragrance of truffle but did not. So if you like to eat the dishes respect the natural flavor of the material, then probably this restaurant is not the one. This restaurant is Michelin One star restaurant. I would recommend the 3 meal or 4 meal courses. Cheaper and enjoy the pretty building and pretty dishes.","507":"Michelin restaurant tucked in the Singapore Botanical gardens - such a wonderful surprise and delightful food experience. \u00c2\u00a0Nicely air-conditioned but not cold. \u00c2\u00a0The courses were timed perfectly and each so yummy. \u00c2\u00a0We never expected to have such a beautiful and tasty meal while exploring a garden. \u00c2\u00a0We enjoyed every course of the meal!","508":"Food is so amazing. We were a small group and we were all enthusiastic about our dining experience. The (celebrity) chef came out at the end, I can only imagine how much effort and passion go into his dishes, really a lot of work and attention to all details.Can't recommend anything in particular as most was excellent. Wagu beef, lobster, desserts.. Nice","509":"A huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Impeccable service - my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four.The Salted Egg Macaroons. My god. These might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. They melt on your tongue, leaving a cacophony of flavour. If there's a peak for Singapore's salted egg obsession, this is it.But truth be told - the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting. The asparagus was quite plain. The gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours. The crispy cod, though, was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting. The venue is beautiful, and the service impeccable. Even if dinner (plus three house wines between four) cost a hefty $400 sgd, it was an evening to remember.","510":"We came to Corner House for dinner on our second night in town. The restaurant itself is within Singapore Botanical Gardens, but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting, there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to Corner House without much trouble. Once there, you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area. There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself. One of the standouts for sure, alongside the decor, is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular - it has the feeling of a high-end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing (thanks to the temperature here, no one shows up in the more formal dress I would expect to see at a European or American Michelin-starred restaurant), but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident. Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good. As for service, I found it a bit more attentive than Candlenut (from the previous night), but in a similar fashion, it was not overly personalized either.In a similar vein, what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got - no deviation or extra surprises along the way. While there are other menu options if you don't come over the weekend, you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise (we were there Sunday). You get 9 courses, but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours, so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than I was expecting to have. That said, I felt that every dish was very strong as a result - it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible. The amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion - our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble. My favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented, which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime-infused broth - simple and refreshing. We moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared. The scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice, and combined with the yuzu, was fresh, and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta - making it a bit of an Italian-inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce. The white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal - the only vegetarian course outside of dessert - but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective. The highlight was definitely the blue cod, which was served with the scales of the skin crisped, mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin...definitely one of the most beautiful-looking fish dishes I have eaten (and gorgeously presented to boot). The wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate, but it was quite delicious (although it could have been cooked a tad more - the middle was too rare for my liking). We finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of French strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser \/ first dessert, followed by a chocolate mousse served with Earl Grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates - probably the heaviest dish of evening, but a nice way to end the meal sated.Corner House is a more Western-oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast Asian cuisine, but even if you have limited time here, it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot. To me, it feels like an appropriate representation of what Singapore has become, and it's worth making the trek out from the city center (about a 15-20 minute drive) to dine here.","511":"I was taken here for a belated birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is situated in the Botanic Gardens, and you may want to look up on how to get there, because the garden is quite... large. I find the food here generally technically competent, with flavor pairings quite fresh, and a fusion of French and a teensy bit of Modsin, which I really enjoy. The Modsin here doesn't go too far, and instead teases the diner here and there.I had the:Amuse bouche, prawn cracker and oyster leafNothing to shout about, nice and crunchyCarabinero prawn with tomatoesI would have loved to eat this with a local prawn, but carabinero works too. Red on red, went very well.Foie gras MousseI loved the petal garnish, but also well-executed, nothing extraordinary.Cod with crispy scalesThis, I loved. I have not eaten such crispy scales, with no hint of oil, and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce. Also, very aesthetically pleasing.WagyuWell-executed, with a delicious onion... thing. My friend doesn't eat beef so they swapped it out with pork.Durian bread and butter puddingI felt the durian could have been stronger, but overall, very tasty, and sweet.Petit foursSalted egg macarons were yum, though the salted egg could have been heavier. Chocs were, well, good.I love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food, and its modsin influence. I do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring. The food here is really technically competent, but could utilize more local produce. Love!","512":"Short review: gourmet hawker center. Long review:Food is creative but not exhilarating. Ambiance is typical and very short of special. Hype is overwhelming with Michelin accolades and table scarcity. You can spend $300pp much more wisely than eating here. Biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast (no photo pictures because of this), lack of intimacy (group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding, which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner), overall casual atmosphere (T-shirt's and crocs allowed).I would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center. Don't \u00c2\u00a0bother dressing nicely, because you will certainly be overdressed. With that in mind, this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion. Instead, go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you're keen on dropping $300-400 per person.","513":"Great food. \u00c2\u00a0Tasting menu , business, was perfect for lunch. \u00c2\u00a0The menu was a little different and not sure that I even knew what some of the items were but trust the chef!","514":"Truly deserves the Michelin Star!!Had gone there for their business lunch, 3 course menu. I think that's the most value for money way to try out the place. Its in an excellent location in the botanical gardens. Their food is a work of art!I had the foie grais, toothfish and the chef's interpretation of kaya toast. Everything was spectacular and amazing in taste. Highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to treat yourself to a great meal!","515":"Totally a restaurant that caught me off guard - one that I saved towards the end of my SG upper tier restaurant binge. Highly recommended in every regard - setting, service, food, and creativity. My girlfriend and I made a Sunday dinner reservation where, quite frankly, I was expecting a typical French fusion restaurant that I see all over NYC, London, etc but there has to be a reason that it is Top 50 in Asia (even though the list is totally hit or miss). We arrived at the drop off location (after a short period of getting lost - Make sure you go to the Nassim Gate location which is at Nassim Road and Cluny Road. Google Maps took us to the other side of the Botanic Gardens at Corner House Gate which is the service entrance), pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant.We sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu. We opted for the dinner Discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned 8 course experience (see image). Afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely French heavy and what I thought was a very expensive list. We did a nice bottle of Hermitage.I LOVE restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot. Every menu option was just...WOW. Not a single course that wasn't to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each. The specific items that blew my mind were the \"Interpretation of my favorite vegetables\" which was a few different snacks using onion, each of which were surprisingly fantastic. Would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing? IT WAS!! Or onion with truffle or dried onion slices? SO GOOD!! Also was the \"Chef Jason's botanica\" which was simply an art piece. Should be in a museum somewhere. Lastly was his \"My favorite childhood food memory\" dessert with meringue crackers, homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread - which was totally out of this world. Anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking, I get happy.Service was impeccable. The waiters were all very kind and friendly, not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber. To add the final touch of perfection, Jason Tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit. Easily part of the top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Asia. Highly recommend if on a date with someone special (you are in the Singapore Botanic Gardens after all), a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together!","516":"The entire experience at Corner House really deserves 4.5 stars but because of the amazing food, they got bumped up to 5.We had the Discovery Menu, and highly recommend it. The onion prepared four ways remains one of the most memorable dishes we have had to date.All waitstaff professional and friendly, we met the Chef who is such a humble guy. A really wonderful restaurant all round, we'll be sure to be back again and again","517":"Fabulous food, one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. Great flavours and combinations. Service was excellent, in total contrast to some other local establishments (*cough* NeonPigeon). The brevity of this review doesn't do the place justice - just go. And make sure you order the melt-in-your-mouth beef.","518":"I'm so fond of this restaurant and it's got so much to do with the exceptional service they offered during our anniversary dinner. My heel broke as I was getting out of the taxi and I carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so I could perform surgery on my shoe. The hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat. She fixed it in 5 minutes so I could climb the stairs to our table. She was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary. I'm so thankful for her!Now to what I know most of you care about shoe repair--food! The menu was rather concise. They offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for $248 per person or a more limited menu for $98 per person that included fewer items. We started with a wonderful bottle of Riesling for $100.Please see my photos for more information on our meal, which was absolutely delightful. Everything was prepared perfectly. The textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal. This place is great for a special occasion, anniversary or birthday. It's not very Paleo-friendly, but it's definitely worth the cheat!","519":"not to be mistaken for chubby hubby is chef jason tan, helming a once historic and now culinary house that has seen the likes of au jardin les amis.the team under him, though a little unpolished, will certainly shine in due course.sophia, hope i got her name right, deserves special mention for her impeccable service.the one thing that you should never pass on here, has to be the breads! the walnut bread, classic french baguette and if you are lucky, his version of ham chee peng were all BRILLIANT.whoever the bakery genius is behind those delicately delicious dough deserves a pay rise immediately!but do limit yourself to only one serving of each and save room for the gastronomical journey that awaits.after your sinful carbo loading jump start comes a plethora of amuse bouche, that is if you are having the discovery menu, that will further convince you that you have come to the right house!the play on taste, colour and texture awakens and heightens your senses in preparation for the courses that follow. the highlights from the discovery menu has to be chef jason's 'botanica', a curation of botanicals in a variety of preparations.it is like fifty shades of vegetables in different doneness, acidity, hue and texture.you will never look at a vegetarian dish in the same way again after consuming this artistically assembled selection of fibrous produce.and just when you thought you have seen it all, another humble vegetable, a favourite of jason's is presented for you to eat in 4 ways!the oignon doux des c\u00c3\u00a9vennes interpreted and transformed into a confit on crispy filo pastry, a dehydrated thinly sliced onion, a whole baked onion with sous vide egg and truffle and finally as an emulsion with earl grey infused onion tea.hey, this man knows, likes his vegetables and you will too!all before led me to the highest crescendo but alas two of three subsequent dishes, that i will single out, send me crashing rock bottom.the cod with crispy scales was overcooked, cold and bland.the bresse pigeon was by far the worst dish of the night!superlatively gamey and way bloodily undercooked!the accompanying foie gras was obviously of the duck variety and tasted as such, quite unpalatable.is this becoming like a roller coaster ride? can his desserts save him?the answer is a resounding yes!especially memorable were the salted egg macaron and the jackfruit mochi.jason is definitely creative and these happy endings led me to give corner house a second chance.and that second chance came in the form of citibank's $100 gourmet with swedish guest chef niklas ekstedt.redemption time?yes!the pacing could have been a little better but somewhat understandable as they were running at full house.am not sure if chef niklas upped jason's game but no fowl play today, hooray!this time around, jason's free range chicken dish was licked cleaned and a five star upgrade from the inedible bresse pigeon dish that bombed so badly in the mouth.his other solo effort was the scallop dish and again it showed that the overcooked cod might have been just a one off letdown.having said that, consistency is of the essence when it comes to dishing out michelin stars.and the fifth from me will be awarded when consistency is achieved.","520":"Went for a lunch with some friends and the experience was lovely. Service staff was patient with our table of 6. Food was delicious and plenty to fill us up. Particularly love the concept of sharing appetizers so we could try a few different dishes.","521":"The 2-storey restaurant sets the mood for \"exquisite eating\" which I didn't hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness. Instead, fine-dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal.The lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top-up if you want a Riso pasta or a Kaya Toast as dessert. A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour. We were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs. We were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served. That's the whole service I give honor to as I care extensively about what I eat and how they flavored my dining exposure.They came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out. I was look forward to the small heap of Yves Bordier French butter - very rich and creamy. Like we did, sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon app\u00c3\u00a9tit!We were presented with the Marinated Norwegian Salmon Trout for a start. I am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat. Nevertheless, the teaser wasn't a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions, celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth. The salmon is nice without a fishy note, very nicely cured.I had the free range chicken instead of the Riso Pasta (supplement of $8), the latter reminds me of Orzo pasta which I once had at The Waterfall Cafe and am still liking it. I didn't want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me. The Free Range Chicken has a very fine texture, baby tender like a juvenile. The skin is lightly pan-seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out. Jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness. The foam like I guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate.I tasted the impressive \"The interpretation of Kaya Toast\" (supplement of $8) and was feeling complete! The taste of Gula Melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding. I love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar, mirroring the chendol we once knew. The muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet - heavenly match.Alternatively, you may choose to go with the Soursoup Sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast. It has a smooth texture with a robust Soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication. Not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of Morello cherry compote. The pretty-looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction. It gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal. However if you adore a loud booming ending, go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me.Oh they have free buggy service, ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden.Bon appetit, yelpers!!!","522":"Super nice environment in the middle of the magnificent Singapore Botanical Garden. Very excellent food. Courteous professional service.The day we were there even the \"suitcase\" chef owner was there and was very pleasant.","523":"this was me and justin b's fancy dinner while on our trip to Singapore and it did not disappoint! first off, the location is awesome within the botanical gardens so its really pretty and tranquil but note that i do not recommend taking the LRT to get here because once you exit the station, its a long walk to the restaurant through the gardens and in the Singapore heat\/humidity, its not that fun haha. after walking to work up an appetite for dinner haha...the restaurant itself is so cute! its just like a house with cool modern-ish decor. making reservations online was easy and no problem in getting availability about 2 weeks in advance. we were seated on the 2nd floor window table which overlooked the gardens for a nice atmosphere. service throughout the meal was outstanding too! as justin b. noticed, you know that you're in a nice restaurant when its the kind of place that folds your napkin for you when you get up to use the restroom haha. everyone was so attentive to our needs and each dish was explained to us in detail that we definitely felt taken care of! i mean after our meal we decided to taxi instead of walk back to the LRT so they called a cab for us and drove us in a golf cart down to the gate so that we didnt have to walk more!as for the meal itself, we both opted to go all out and ordered the Discovery Menu and the wine pairings to go with it haha...every dish was a visual masterpiece! the presentation was so beautiful and some dishes like the vegetable garden which had some like 40+ ingredients in it was almost too pretty to eat haha. the taste of the food was actually really good too though haha...while every dish didnt wow me, they were all good and tasty - the pork jowl, beef, and cocoa pebble dessert were my faves though and they send you home with a tin of madeline cookies that were really good. the wine pairing turned out really well for us too - very generous pours and it was practically a diff wine with each dish so i felt that was worthwhile to do. just the overall price point about ~$300 USD per person and i wasnt overwhelmingly impressed with each dish holds me back from the full 5-star rating...but if you want a nice fancy dinner in singapore, i would still recommend Corner House!","524":"Great food and excellent decor. Definitely should check it out.There's not a lot else to write, but I have to fill space so here's some words. Please dont moderate me yelp!","525":"Came here for the lunch tasting menu since it was a bit cheaper than dinner.Coming in here they start you off with some bread and nicely whipped butter. Need less to say that it was amazing. The tasting menu consisted of Amuse bouche, carabinero prawns, New Zealand Blue Cod (crispy scales), Wagyu beef cheek, Japanese chestnut. The amuse bouche that was served to us was a leech bubble bursting with a delicate cold sweetness and a shrimp cracker with some roe. The former is a little bit sweeter but then the latter is more savory, so definitely eat in that order. We then had these prawns and wow that was amazing. The spot prawns were cooked sashimi style and served in this amazing bed of fruits and vegetables. It was such a light dish that had so much going on (sweetness, acidic, multiple textures) and I loved this dish. I found myself finishing all the dressing as well since it was just so perfect and really maximized the freshness of the spot prawns. It came with some squid ink rice crackers so really let you get a very delectable bite.Next come the entrees, and IMO the absolute star of the show: the cod with fried skin. They leave the scales on and deep fry that!!!! I have never had this in my life, but omg if this wasn't the best cod I've had in my life. Step one, the meat is obviously cooked to perfection. Not too tough as to be overcooked, and not too soft where it's a bit raw, just perfect. But that is tablestakes, the jewel was the skin. The scales all popped up and was sprinkled with a generous amount of sea salt and a bite into the skin just felt like you were tasting this fish straight from the ocean with all it's saltiness. It was amazing. The texture was so crispy and it didn't leak to the tender meat below. The beef wagyu cheek was probably the best cheek I've had. That being said though, I'm not sure if I love cheek that much. The texture of cheek is traditionally chewy, and here it was fattier and much more tender than I'm used to. It almost tasted like other parts of wagyu (flank for example), but I would've just preferred normal ribeye wagyu. I appreciate the quality and skill here and I feel it's like showcasing a more forgotten piece of steak, I would just rather have the wagyu ribeye though.The dessert left a little to be desired. There was some alchohol flavor in the sauce and the dish was good, just nothing too special here. All in all, it was a great meal and came out to be S$230 after tip and taxes for two. I think the price point is pretty spot on and I would come back. It's not a bargain by any means, but not a rip off either.","526":"I tried the chef's choice 5 meal courses for S$158.00. It was very beautiful sophisticated presentation. Wagyu dishes was over flavored. Don't really taste wagyu itself flavor. Black truffle was on the one of the dishes. When I bite it, I expect to smell the great fragrance of truffle but did not. So if you like to eat the dishes respect the natural flavor of the material, then probably this restaurant is not the one. This restaurant is Michelin One star restaurant. I would recommend the 3 meal or 4 meal courses. Cheaper and enjoy the pretty building and pretty dishes.","527":"Michelin restaurant tucked in the Singapore Botanical gardens - such a wonderful surprise and delightful food experience. \u00c2\u00a0Nicely air-conditioned but not cold. \u00c2\u00a0The courses were timed perfectly and each so yummy. \u00c2\u00a0We never expected to have such a beautiful and tasty meal while exploring a garden. \u00c2\u00a0We enjoyed every course of the meal!","528":"Food is so amazing. We were a small group and we were all enthusiastic about our dining experience. The (celebrity) chef came out at the end, I can only imagine how much effort and passion go into his dishes, really a lot of work and attention to all details.Can't recommend anything in particular as most was excellent. Wagu beef, lobster, desserts.. Nice","529":"A huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Impeccable service - my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four.The Salted Egg Macaroons. My god. These might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. They melt on your tongue, leaving a cacophony of flavour. If there's a peak for Singapore's salted egg obsession, this is it.But truth be told - the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting. The asparagus was quite plain. The gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours. The crispy cod, though, was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting. The venue is beautiful, and the service impeccable. Even if dinner (plus three house wines between four) cost a hefty $400 sgd, it was an evening to remember.","530":"We came to Corner House for dinner on our second night in town. The restaurant itself is within Singapore Botanical Gardens, but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting, there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to Corner House without much trouble. Once there, you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area. There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself. One of the standouts for sure, alongside the decor, is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular - it has the feeling of a high-end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing (thanks to the temperature here, no one shows up in the more formal dress I would expect to see at a European or American Michelin-starred restaurant), but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident. Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good. As for service, I found it a bit more attentive than Candlenut (from the previous night), but in a similar fashion, it was not overly personalized either.In a similar vein, what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got - no deviation or extra surprises along the way. While there are other menu options if you don't come over the weekend, you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise (we were there Sunday). You get 9 courses, but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours, so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than I was expecting to have. That said, I felt that every dish was very strong as a result - it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible. The amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion - our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble. My favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented, which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime-infused broth - simple and refreshing. We moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared. The scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice, and combined with the yuzu, was fresh, and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta - making it a bit of an Italian-inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce. The white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal - the only vegetarian course outside of dessert - but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective. The highlight was definitely the blue cod, which was served with the scales of the skin crisped, mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin...definitely one of the most beautiful-looking fish dishes I have eaten (and gorgeously presented to boot). The wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate, but it was quite delicious (although it could have been cooked a tad more - the middle was too rare for my liking). We finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of French strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser \/ first dessert, followed by a chocolate mousse served with Earl Grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates - probably the heaviest dish of evening, but a nice way to end the meal sated.Corner House is a more Western-oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast Asian cuisine, but even if you have limited time here, it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot. To me, it feels like an appropriate representation of what Singapore has become, and it's worth making the trek out from the city center (about a 15-20 minute drive) to dine here.","531":"I was taken here for a belated birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is situated in the Botanic Gardens, and you may want to look up on how to get there, because the garden is quite... large. I find the food here generally technically competent, with flavor pairings quite fresh, and a fusion of French and a teensy bit of Modsin, which I really enjoy. The Modsin here doesn't go too far, and instead teases the diner here and there.I had the:Amuse bouche, prawn cracker and oyster leafNothing to shout about, nice and crunchyCarabinero prawn with tomatoesI would have loved to eat this with a local prawn, but carabinero works too. Red on red, went very well.Foie gras MousseI loved the petal garnish, but also well-executed, nothing extraordinary.Cod with crispy scalesThis, I loved. I have not eaten such crispy scales, with no hint of oil, and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce. Also, very aesthetically pleasing.WagyuWell-executed, with a delicious onion... thing. My friend doesn't eat beef so they swapped it out with pork.Durian bread and butter puddingI felt the durian could have been stronger, but overall, very tasty, and sweet.Petit foursSalted egg macarons were yum, though the salted egg could have been heavier. Chocs were, well, good.I love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food, and its modsin influence. I do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring. The food here is really technically competent, but could utilize more local produce. Love!","532":"Short review: gourmet hawker center. Long review:Food is creative but not exhilarating. Ambiance is typical and very short of special. Hype is overwhelming with Michelin accolades and table scarcity. You can spend $300pp much more wisely than eating here. Biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast (no photo pictures because of this), lack of intimacy (group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding, which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner), overall casual atmosphere (T-shirt's and crocs allowed).I would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center. Don't \u00c2\u00a0bother dressing nicely, because you will certainly be overdressed. With that in mind, this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion. Instead, go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you're keen on dropping $300-400 per person.","533":"Great food. \u00c2\u00a0Tasting menu , business, was perfect for lunch. \u00c2\u00a0The menu was a little different and not sure that I even knew what some of the items were but trust the chef!","534":"Truly deserves the Michelin Star!!Had gone there for their business lunch, 3 course menu. I think that's the most value for money way to try out the place. Its in an excellent location in the botanical gardens. Their food is a work of art!I had the foie grais, toothfish and the chef's interpretation of kaya toast. Everything was spectacular and amazing in taste. Highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to treat yourself to a great meal!","535":"Totally a restaurant that caught me off guard - one that I saved towards the end of my SG upper tier restaurant binge. Highly recommended in every regard - setting, service, food, and creativity. My girlfriend and I made a Sunday dinner reservation where, quite frankly, I was expecting a typical French fusion restaurant that I see all over NYC, London, etc but there has to be a reason that it is Top 50 in Asia (even though the list is totally hit or miss). We arrived at the drop off location (after a short period of getting lost - Make sure you go to the Nassim Gate location which is at Nassim Road and Cluny Road. Google Maps took us to the other side of the Botanic Gardens at Corner House Gate which is the service entrance), pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant.We sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu. We opted for the dinner Discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned 8 course experience (see image). Afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely French heavy and what I thought was a very expensive list. We did a nice bottle of Hermitage.I LOVE restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot. Every menu option was just...WOW. Not a single course that wasn't to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each. The specific items that blew my mind were the \"Interpretation of my favorite vegetables\" which was a few different snacks using onion, each of which were surprisingly fantastic. Would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing? IT WAS!! Or onion with truffle or dried onion slices? SO GOOD!! Also was the \"Chef Jason's botanica\" which was simply an art piece. Should be in a museum somewhere. Lastly was his \"My favorite childhood food memory\" dessert with meringue crackers, homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread - which was totally out of this world. Anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking, I get happy.Service was impeccable. The waiters were all very kind and friendly, not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber. To add the final touch of perfection, Jason Tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit. Easily part of the top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Asia. Highly recommend if on a date with someone special (you are in the Singapore Botanic Gardens after all), a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together!","536":"The entire experience at Corner House really deserves 4.5 stars but because of the amazing food, they got bumped up to 5.We had the Discovery Menu, and highly recommend it. The onion prepared four ways remains one of the most memorable dishes we have had to date.All waitstaff professional and friendly, we met the Chef who is such a humble guy. A really wonderful restaurant all round, we'll be sure to be back again and again","537":"Fabulous food, one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. Great flavours and combinations. Service was excellent, in total contrast to some other local establishments (*cough* NeonPigeon). The brevity of this review doesn't do the place justice - just go. And make sure you order the melt-in-your-mouth beef.","538":"I'm so fond of this restaurant and it's got so much to do with the exceptional service they offered during our anniversary dinner. My heel broke as I was getting out of the taxi and I carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so I could perform surgery on my shoe. The hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat. She fixed it in 5 minutes so I could climb the stairs to our table. She was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary. I'm so thankful for her!Now to what I know most of you care about shoe repair--food! The menu was rather concise. They offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for $248 per person or a more limited menu for $98 per person that included fewer items. We started with a wonderful bottle of Riesling for $100.Please see my photos for more information on our meal, which was absolutely delightful. Everything was prepared perfectly. The textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal. This place is great for a special occasion, anniversary or birthday. It's not very Paleo-friendly, but it's definitely worth the cheat!","539":"not to be mistaken for chubby hubby is chef jason tan, helming a once historic and now culinary house that has seen the likes of au jardin les amis.the team under him, though a little unpolished, will certainly shine in due course.sophia, hope i got her name right, deserves special mention for her impeccable service.the one thing that you should never pass on here, has to be the breads! the walnut bread, classic french baguette and if you are lucky, his version of ham chee peng were all BRILLIANT.whoever the bakery genius is behind those delicately delicious dough deserves a pay rise immediately!but do limit yourself to only one serving of each and save room for the gastronomical journey that awaits.after your sinful carbo loading jump start comes a plethora of amuse bouche, that is if you are having the discovery menu, that will further convince you that you have come to the right house!the play on taste, colour and texture awakens and heightens your senses in preparation for the courses that follow. the highlights from the discovery menu has to be chef jason's 'botanica', a curation of botanicals in a variety of preparations.it is like fifty shades of vegetables in different doneness, acidity, hue and texture.you will never look at a vegetarian dish in the same way again after consuming this artistically assembled selection of fibrous produce.and just when you thought you have seen it all, another humble vegetable, a favourite of jason's is presented for you to eat in 4 ways!the oignon doux des c\u00c3\u00a9vennes interpreted and transformed into a confit on crispy filo pastry, a dehydrated thinly sliced onion, a whole baked onion with sous vide egg and truffle and finally as an emulsion with earl grey infused onion tea.hey, this man knows, likes his vegetables and you will too!all before led me to the highest crescendo but alas two of three subsequent dishes, that i will single out, send me crashing rock bottom.the cod with crispy scales was overcooked, cold and bland.the bresse pigeon was by far the worst dish of the night!superlatively gamey and way bloodily undercooked!the accompanying foie gras was obviously of the duck variety and tasted as such, quite unpalatable.is this becoming like a roller coaster ride? can his desserts save him?the answer is a resounding yes!especially memorable were the salted egg macaron and the jackfruit mochi.jason is definitely creative and these happy endings led me to give corner house a second chance.and that second chance came in the form of citibank's $100 gourmet with swedish guest chef niklas ekstedt.redemption time?yes!the pacing could have been a little better but somewhat understandable as they were running at full house.am not sure if chef niklas upped jason's game but no fowl play today, hooray!this time around, jason's free range chicken dish was licked cleaned and a five star upgrade from the inedible bresse pigeon dish that bombed so badly in the mouth.his other solo effort was the scallop dish and again it showed that the overcooked cod might have been just a one off letdown.having said that, consistency is of the essence when it comes to dishing out michelin stars.and the fifth from me will be awarded when consistency is achieved.","540":"Went for a lunch with some friends and the experience was lovely. Service staff was patient with our table of 6. Food was delicious and plenty to fill us up. Particularly love the concept of sharing appetizers so we could try a few different dishes.","541":"The 2-storey restaurant sets the mood for \"exquisite eating\" which I didn't hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness. Instead, fine-dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal.The lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top-up if you want a Riso pasta or a Kaya Toast as dessert. A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour. We were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs. We were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served. That's the whole service I give honor to as I care extensively about what I eat and how they flavored my dining exposure.They came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out. I was look forward to the small heap of Yves Bordier French butter - very rich and creamy. Like we did, sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon app\u00c3\u00a9tit!We were presented with the Marinated Norwegian Salmon Trout for a start. I am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat. Nevertheless, the teaser wasn't a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions, celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth. The salmon is nice without a fishy note, very nicely cured.I had the free range chicken instead of the Riso Pasta (supplement of $8), the latter reminds me of Orzo pasta which I once had at The Waterfall Cafe and am still liking it. I didn't want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me. The Free Range Chicken has a very fine texture, baby tender like a juvenile. The skin is lightly pan-seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out. Jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness. The foam like I guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate.I tasted the impressive \"The interpretation of Kaya Toast\" (supplement of $8) and was feeling complete!

The hardest decision starving myself so I can pack all the delicious offerings and still lament over what else I want to eat.Disclaimer: No air-conditioning, noisy, crowded, and expect long lines or queues. If you can put aside these dining conditions, Old Airport Road is AMAZING! It is a Must-Eat Stop for me in SG.Top of my list: Seafood Soup with Minced Pork Balls Yan Ji Seafood Soup): This cloudy soup is slowed cooked with layers of flavor. There is hint of wokhei. Fried flat fish ground and added to the minced pork elevates the flavor. It is salty and I don't like cooked seafood usually, but I cannot got enough of this broth. I dream about this soup in the USA. I usually get the soup with just the meatballs, but everyone else gets fish. I hear the prawns are cooked perfectly, firm, succulent and sweet. Hint: the cheap standard fish they offer is good enough. Don't be put off the price. It is worth it. Drink lots of water after that. $6 up per bowl.Rojak or Salad with Shrimp Paste: Jicama, guava, cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts, crispy ew char kuay or fried dough sticks, Century eggs (fermented black eggs buried underground with ammonia) mixed with a sweet, nutty haekor or shrimp paste that has the consistency of molasses.Gong Gong or boiled sea snails: It is an art to eat these delectable bad boys. Gingerly skewer the flesh beyond the foot. Slowly ease the flesh until the whole animal is out. Hold the morsel by the foot, dip into sambal belacan or chili paste with fermented shrimp with a generous squeeze of lime, hold foot, bite and remove foot. It is chewy near the foot, creamy entrails at the end, spicy and delicate gift from the sea. \u00c2\u00a0$10 per plate.Char siu pork and roast pork (sioh bak) from Roast Paradise: crispy deeply marinated char siu and salty, crunchy roast pork belly and crackling served with rice. Tasty dipping sauce and mustard for condiments. Ask for more cucumber.Ice Kachang or shaved ice: Smooth shaved ice drizzled with colored stripes and sweet corn with syrup atop red beans, jellies and uptup chee, gelatinous sweetened seeds from a palm. They are generous, I found 4 yesterday!!! It is better when you share and fight for the uptup chee. Other delicious desserts are the green jellied Nonya Chendol shaved iced drizzled with gula Melaka palm sugar syrup , Cheng Tng dessert soup with lotus seeds, gingko nuts and dried longan.There are so many other stalls I wanted to try, but I can't get past my favorites. I want to try at least one more dish each time but my stomach fails me.If you are still peckish, try the Epok Epok or curry puff with egg, char kuay teow or rice noodles with black soy and cockles, plump oysters in a half shell (S$3 per oyster).","550":"I was excited to visit Old Airport Road Hawker Center specifically for \"Lor Mee\" from the Uber popular stall- - \"Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong\" after watching a segment on YouTube. I braved the long queue and waited over an hour to partake in, what I expected to be a bowl of yumminess. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment! Lor Mee- served with noodles and a generous topping of fish and other ingredients. The gravy was significantly rich and thick with a slightly gelatinous texture and predominantly tasted of fish. It's definitely an acquired taste. Not something I'd get again. Despite the rave reviews of Lor Mee, the unsung hero is the Minced Mixed Noodle IMO. Pork dumplings and minced pork swimming in a bowl of wide rice noodles. The broth was light and full of flavors with the fresh herbs adding brightness to this delicious dish. A must try! Char Kway Teow noodles and proteins were impeccably cooked with a beautifully smoky charred flavor however, it was well under seasoned and one noted. Perhaps a dash of soy sauce will help lift the flavors a bit or it was an off day for the stall. Overall it wasn't a bad dish. Fried prawn and pork rolls were a mixed of sweet and savory flavors. While it wasn't my favorite, it was a nice side dish. Curry Chicken and Black Pepper Pork Puffs had a flaky crispy crusts and loaded with herbs and spices. A great snack especially on the go. A great tourist destination for food, sweets and beverages on the cheap!","551":"Ok. Maybe I was waiting to be blown away after it was talked up so much but it was just ok \/ good. \u00c2\u00a0 We had some noodles and a clay chicken pot with rice. Clay pot dish seemed a little dry and over cooked to me. Maybe we went too late but and it was the bottom of the barrel. It did take 15 min to prepare so it wasn't just thrown together. Anyway pretty good and no complaints but I don't think I'd make the trek to a hawker market again. I'd eat passing by. Experience box checked.","552":"Lots of goodies but goodiesLor mie, nyonya chendol, SALT sous vide style hawker stall","553":"The hawker food options are limitless here!! There are so many hawker stalls to choose from and they all look so good! I can't pinpoint any single one, but I bet you won't be disappointed with any of these mom and pop shops. \u00c2\u00a0It's a little ways out of the main downtown area, but can easily be accessed via public transportation.","554":"old airport road, known as the most popular Hawker in Singapore, offers a wide selection of food across different price points depending on what you eat. I love eating here, but it also makes my indecisiveness a problem haha. Some of the stalls will sell out and close early, to make sure you get to try everything, go in a group and go for lunch instead of dinner. I've had a few times where I wanted to get roast meats there, but they sell out before dinner :(","555":"Loved this hawker center! Tried so many different types of food for so cheap.Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wonton Noodles (5\/5) was definitely a favorite here. They nailed the wonton noodle dish - the perfect amount of chili sauce, dried shrimp, and meat to sauce to noodle ratio. We also tried Hock Guan's rojak (5\/5), which was delicious. I only had this once while in Singapore, so I can't compare it to other places.We ordered some pork satay from Chuan Kee Satay (4\/5). The flavor was amazing and the pork was tender, but it was definitely on the oily side.Whampoa Soya Bean's (5\/5) bean curd with red bean was sensational! I wish I buy an entire tub of this and eat it everyday :'(","556":"Selera Rasa - If you have not heard of the now $3.50 briyani, you are missing out.Used to get this back in my ns days when it was like $3 and was super stoked to find out the hawker was still around 4 years later. The macik is the best, she is super nice and used to remember our faces when we came over for lunch. That being said, I only remember her being opened till the mid afternoon. Never saw the place open for dinner.But I digress. This is hands-down one of the best briyanis on the island. The rice is fragrant and goes super well with the curry they used. The fried chicken and it's little fried scraps are tasty and fresh. Be sure to ask for veg and the papadum as well, she was out of veg when I got there at 2pm.Nevertheless, always worth the visit.Selera Rasa is located in the corner of old airport road food center. The corner being the side closer to the hdb blocks, as opposed to the cross street.","557":"If you come to this food court, get the prawn mee at Albert Street Prawn Noodle. The line can get outrageously long, so maybe try getting here before the rush. Seriously though, the prawn mee is amazingly delicious- a really unique and complex mix of flavors in one broth. Also, get the Or Chein (oyster omelette) at Xing Li Cooked Food. And if you have a sweet tooth and want something to cool down with away from the heat and humidity, Nyona Chendol is good- I like the original, but adding red beans looks just as good. Everything here is cheap, relatively speaking. Old Airport Road is popular and a bit more touristy, but also a little further away from town, so if you're a visitor, you should just call a taxi (MRT is always good, but not everyone has the time or patience to check routes and stops). If you're a tourist with little to no exposure to Singaporean and Malaysian food, most of the food here will probably seem to be delicious to you. More often than not, if there's a long line for one particular hawker, the food is good. But seriously, no trip Singapore would be complete without visiting a good ole food court.","558":"As I was doing my research on which hawkers are the best and that I must visit, Old Airport Road was one of the highest rated one. As you get off the metro station, don't get the first food court area confused with the hawker which is right after. However, the food center opens earlier than the hawker. The hawker location had great food selection although this hawker was not my favorite just based on overall atmosphere.","559":"Roast Paradise #01-122Charsiew with chicken rice - 4 starsNot much meat and the meat has a layer of fat in each slice and is a bit too burnt on the edges which I don't quite like. But overall the meat is cooked really well - moist, juicy meat, not too sweet or salty.BNR CoffeeKopi C Kosong Bing - 4 starsRich good flavor even without sugar. Would get less ice the next time.Park at the multistorey carpark! The lanes are nice and wide compared to most other HDB carparks.","560":"Praise the lord for Hawker centers! With so many hawker centers in Singapore, it is hard to decide which one in my favourite. Old Airport Road Food Centre is definitely a stand out. It is highly accessible via multiple bus line. With endless options such as prawn noodle, wonton noodles, fish balls, fresh juice, curry puffs, rojak, kopi and kaya toast available; this center is where food dreams are form.

Our friend who lives in Singapore suggested that we meet here for lunch and it was a fantastic adventure.We employed the long queue method for determining which stalls to purchase from. For a feast of 4 dishes and 5 drinks, we spent about $30 total. The best item we got by far was the BBQ meat. I'm not sure which stall it was but this one is absolutely worth seeking out. Happy eating!","562":"Wow! I had such an amazing experience here while I was visiting Singapore. I LOVED the fresh juices and smoothies along with the chicken rice. If you're in Singapore, you need to check this place out because you won't be disappointed.

We went to eat at Maxwell Hawker Food Centre twice already and decided to come here instead. To get here, you'll need to take the MRT to \"Dakota\" stop and it's along the Circle (YELLOW) Line. This place is pretty huge. The first floor are the hawker stalls and the 2nd floor are mainly shops selling goods.Stalls that we tried:-Roast Paradise [Stall #01-121]: They offer roasted pig and char siew dishes. Our meals costed 4 SGD each.-Hong Hua Dessert [Stall #01-86]: They offer a variety of shaved iced desserts. We shared the \"Ice Kachang\" and it costed 1.50 SGD.-We also got the sugar cane drink. But, I don't recall what stall it was.Not bad overall. I wanted to try Chau Kee Satay [Stall #01-85], but they only open in the evenings. I also wanted to try Lao Ban Soya Beancurd [Stall #01-127] again, but I was already too full to eat anymore (Note: I tried their tofu dessert at Maxwell tho].

Quite packed and a bit difficult to find seat for a large group but nonetheless a good place to visit to immerse in the true local experienceReviews of some popular stalls I have been to per the below.- Dong Ji Fried Kuay Teow - the stir-fried noodle here has a nice wok smell but the line is long and moves slowly so gotta be patient- Lao Fu Zi Fried Kuay Teow - another fried kuay teow stall - this one has a stronger walk smell than Dong Ji but I personally prefer Dong Ji's seasoning of the noodle. A very good option nonetheless but super long slow line since they cook one dish at a time - Wen Wen Prawn Mee - average - nothing particularly special- Roast Paradise - really good BBQ pork - recommend- Nam Sing Hokkien Mee - usually I'm not a big fan of Hokkien Mee but this one is good - the noodle is not too soggy from the gravy and there's a hint of wok smell in the sauce. Long line.- Chuan kee satay - Ok \/ despite its popularity, I have had better satay elsewhere- Toa Payoh Rojak - personally not a Rojak fan but this is one of the better ones I have had - the ingredients were fresh and well-balanced. If you order with chili, it can indeed get spicy- Hua Kee Wanton Meat - good \/ comforting wonton noodles - not mindblowing but a safe good bet- 51 Soya Bean - a good place for traditional SG\/Chinese dessert - try the tao huey (cold tofu pudding)- Sugar Cane Juice - a classic SG refreshment for a hot day","567":"I loved the hawker center here. \u00c2\u00a0My cousin and her fiancee took us here as this was their favorite. \u00c2\u00a0You can find a seat first, and then go to all of the different stands. \u00c2\u00a0Let them know how many ppl are eating, they price the portions so you don't have to pay for more than you can eat. They bring the food straight to your table number when it's ready. \u00c2\u00a0Even when you pay for beer, they bring the bottles to your table too. \u00c2\u00a0Absolutely great food and experience.","568":"Amazing food court, BUT BEWARE - if you are not used to Asian food and are being experimental touring Singapore, this may not be the place for you, try something like Lau Pasat instead","569":"Five-star Food Centre! The hardest decision starving myself so I can pack all the delicious offerings and still lament over what else I want to eat.Disclaimer: No air-conditioning, noisy, crowded, and expect long lines or queues. If you can put aside these dining conditions, Old Airport Road is AMAZING! It is a Must-Eat Stop for me in SG.Top of my list: Seafood Soup with Minced Pork Balls Yan Ji Seafood Soup): This cloudy soup is slowed cooked with layers of flavor. There is hint of wokhei. Fried flat fish ground and added to the minced pork elevates the flavor. It is salty and I don't like cooked seafood usually, but I cannot got enough of this broth. I dream about this soup in the USA. I usually get the soup with just the meatballs, but everyone else gets fish. I hear the prawns are cooked perfectly, firm, succulent and sweet. Hint: the cheap standard fish they offer is good enough. Don't be put off the price. It is worth it. Drink lots of water after that. $6 up per bowl.Rojak or Salad with Shrimp Paste: Jicama, guava, cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts, crispy ew char kuay or fried dough sticks, Century eggs (fermented black eggs buried underground with ammonia) mixed with a sweet, nutty haekor or shrimp paste that has the consistency of molasses.Gong Gong or boiled sea snails: It is an art to eat these delectable bad boys. Gingerly skewer the flesh beyond the foot. Slowly ease the flesh until the whole animal is out. Hold the morsel by the foot, dip into sambal belacan or chili paste with fermented shrimp with a generous squeeze of lime, hold foot, bite and remove foot. It is chewy near the foot, creamy entrails at the end, spicy and delicate gift from the sea. \u00c2\u00a0$10 per plate.Char siu pork and roast pork (sioh bak) from Roast Paradise: crispy deeply marinated char siu and salty, crunchy roast pork belly and crackling served with rice. Tasty dipping sauce and mustard for condiments. Ask for more cucumber.Ice Kachang or shaved ice: Smooth shaved ice drizzled with colored stripes and sweet corn with syrup atop red beans, jellies and uptup chee, gelatinous sweetened seeds from a palm. They are generous, I found 4 yesterday!!! It is better when you share and fight for the uptup chee. Other delicious desserts are the green jellied Nonya Chendol shaved iced drizzled with gula Melaka palm sugar syrup , Cheng Tng dessert soup with lotus seeds, gingko nuts and dried longan.There are so many other stalls I wanted to try, but I can't get past my favorites. I want to try at least one more dish each time but my stomach fails me.If you are still peckish, try the Epok Epok or curry puff with egg, char kuay teow or rice noodles with black soy and cockles, plump oysters in a half shell (S$3 per oyster).","570":"I was excited to visit Old Airport Road Hawker Center specifically for \"Lor Mee\" from the Uber popular stall- - \"Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong\" after watching a segment on YouTube. I braved the long queue and waited over an hour to partake in, what I expected to be a bowl of yumminess. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment! Lor Mee- served with noodles and a generous topping of fish and other ingredients. The gravy was significantly rich and thick with a slightly gelatinous texture and predominantly tasted of fish. It's definitely an acquired taste. Not something I'd get again. Despite the rave reviews of Lor Mee, the unsung hero is the Minced Mixed Noodle IMO. Pork dumplings and minced pork swimming in a bowl of wide rice noodles. The broth was light and full of flavors with the fresh herbs adding brightness to this delicious dish. A must try! Char Kway Teow noodles and proteins were impeccably cooked with a beautifully smoky charred flavor however, it was well under seasoned and one noted. Perhaps a dash of soy sauce will help lift the flavors a bit or it was an off day for the stall. Overall it wasn't a bad dish. Fried prawn and pork rolls were a mixed of sweet and savory flavors. While it wasn't my favorite, it was a nice side dish. Curry Chicken and Black Pepper Pork Puffs had a flaky crispy crusts and loaded with herbs and spices. A great snack especially on the go.

This spot started as a hawker stand and blew up, to having 3 locations now. The food is so good that its attracted many celebrities and hype with the news. The service is quick and snappy, and this location fortunately has AC. The laksa itself has a slighter milder taste, but it's perfectly balanced with the seafood, while sporting a nice spicy kick. The noodles are also cut so you eat it with a soup spoon - chopsticks are not even offered! In addition to the laksa, you can even pair it with otah or nasi lemak for not much more!Overall, this was my favorite laksa spot I've tried and I highly recommend giving here a try!","589":"Didn't know this place was so popular? After walking in and seeing all of these famous people's photos plastered on the wall thought for sure it will be great!In their Laksa they don't use chicken or shrimp they use blood clams or also called cockles. It was really spicy so I could only eat a few spoonfuls before giving up.Not sure I would be back as I can't take the heat.","590":"Sweared by locals that this is the best laksa place in Singapore so I had to give it a try. This place looks like a fast food joint, where you go up to the counter and order what you would like to eat and your name will be called when your food is ready. There were 2 specials that you could order but mostly people just order the laksa in either small or large. The large was split between my cousin and myself for about $7 SGD, which is reasonable for a big bowl of laksa.The broth was very creamy and noodles were cooked al dente. This place only gives you spoons to eat your bowl but is easy to do so. Overall, recommend this place if you're wanting to try some good Laksa while in Singapore!","591":"In my previous SGP trip I had a great experience eating here. This time around It was still satisfying but they skimped on the ingredients. The sign of an over-hyped industrialized tourist spot. \u00c2\u00a0Also I noticed the pictures of Anthony Bourdain has been removed from the wall, what a shame. The posters of other celeb visitors such as Gordon Ramsay, Martin Yen & Samantha Brown are still there just as I remembered. Got the standard laksa again, the broth was still excellent as I remembered: rich, creamy, smooth & spicy. \u00c2\u00a0But it only contained basic ingredients such as some bean sprouts & a few cockles, no other seafood (e.g. shrimps) unless you pay extra. Standard katong style short rice noodles that can be eaten with a spoon, no chopsticks needed.The $2 nasi lemak wrapped in leaf: very forgetable, rice was dry & not much flavor even with their samba sauce. It also contained a sorry-looking piece of small dry fish.Overall the broth of their laksa is still one of the best I have ever had. I just don't like the fact that they took advantage of their fame & skimped on other ingredients. I ate at multiple good laksa places, including its equally famed competitor across the street as well as the trishaw laksa in Hon Lim center, they both had descend amount of \"seafood\" in their standard basic laksa.","592":"Perfect Michelin fast food for $7SGD! This dish is made to be used with spoon only so you have some of the soup and broken noodles in one spoonful. A bit spicy with a coconut milk flavor to calm the heat. No napkins around here. Popular during lunch rush hour. This is how laksa should taste.","593":"Great bowl of laksa! There's good seafood flavors with the bowl. My only complaint is there is not enough seafood, there's really only a few small pieces of mussels in there. Overall, really good bowl of noods. It's cash only FYI.","594":"I really enjoyed the large bowl of laksa, not too spicy, the chili paste adds an interesting zing to the flavor. \u00c2\u00a0The lime juice was very good as well. \u00c2\u00a0I also ordered the shrimp siu mai, the siu mai goes well with the chili paste.","595":"Had to have Laksa in Singapore, and was told this is a place to try. \u00c2\u00a0They said if there's a lot of celebrity pictures on the wall, then it's probably a good place to eat. There's nothing super fancy about the Laksa, except that it taste awesome. \u00c2\u00a0I also had Otah for the first time, which is surprisingly good.","596":"The Laksa is the absolute bomb. Gordon Ramsey even went to this location. His picture is on the \"wall of shame\". \u00c2\u00a0The siu mai and the chili crab pau aka steam buns is a must order. You can eat the noodles with a soup spoon. Ask for chop sticks and they say No","597":"The best laksa. Period.Living in Toronto where you can virtually order any cuisine you wish, I thought I knew what good laksa was. After visiting 328 Katong Laksa, it's officially ruined all other laksa for me.Located in a small restaurant, this self serve joint is a no fuss type of establishment. What's interesting is they don't provide chopsticks. You're expected to slurp down your laksa with no other utensil other than your spoon.Not sure if this made everything taste better, but this bowl was the best tasting laksa I've had - even after trying several laksa joints in previous days. The spicy kick and the creaminess of the broth provided a beautiful base to the noodles and seafood that soaked up all the flavor. The serving was just enough to get you full - although I wish I had room to try the other items.Tip: Bring tissue to wipe off sweat from the spice.","598":"My first experience with laksa curry noodle soup, and this place lives up to its hype as a 1 Michelin Star restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0The broth was delicious, and I could not stop eating despite wiping the sweat off my brow after every couple of bites. \u00c2\u00a0(I have a low tolerance for spicy food). The place it unassuming, cozy, and prefers to have its food speak for itself. \u00c2\u00a0What a nice piece of memory in Katong.","599":"Their original laksa was SO GOOD!!! You probably won't find another Laksa place better than this one and it's not just a hype! The noodles are cut for you so can use a spoon to scoop out the spoonfuls of goodness! This \"katong\" style Laksa is filled with big prawns, fish cake, cockles, mushrooms and topped with some coriander with a light coconut milk that isn't too overpowering. For visitors like me who grew up in North America, we tend to lose a bit of appetite when traveling to hot cities like Singapore (37 degrees that day I was there), so i only ordered a small bowl since i wasn't sure if I could finish it on my own, immediately after the first sip of the soup, I regret not ordering something bigger!! I fell in love with the soup immediately and the temperature inside or outside didn't bother me at all and was actually quite comforting! A little sweaty after, but not too crazy :) I wish i knew how to make this at home so I can enjoy this everyday! I will definitely come back when I visit Singapore again!","600":"\"Shiok\" is truly the only word to describe this place. Although I suppose you could debate that personal preference plays a part in the Singapore v. Penang style laksa battle, I think Katong Laksa is miles ahead of all else. The broth is deliciously bold with seafood, coconut and curry flavors. The noodles come cut so you can enjoy each spoonful with the perfect combination of soup and noodles. Cheap, delicious, authentic. YUM","601":"I came from Hawaii. To taste the original Laksa \u00c2\u00a0that made my mouth water when I ate it in Honolulu. \u00c2\u00a0I was disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0Again Fame baby remember my name made this place famous and is again part of its \u00c2\u00a0notoriety downfall. Soup tasty, seafood \u00c2\u00a0, \u00c2\u00a0I had a hard time locating the shrimp that was in their photos. minimal, noodles ok but I'm used to two kinds. The nasi lemak \u00c2\u00a0rice was a pleasant surprise.","602":"The 32 Katong Laksa here is overrated. The staff are rude and proud. Maybe because they are one of the most famous laksa store in Singapore. I feel that the laksa here is normal. There are certainly many other better laksa around in Singapore.","603":"Came by for breakfast after a couple suggestions from locals. Ordered the small laksa and didn't quite get the hype.At $5.35 SGD, there was a small bowl of coconut curry noodles that actually quite thick. The bowl was 95% noodles with a few tiny shrimps and fish cake. ...Took a few bites and went on with my day......Not quite sure I get the hype with Laksa...","604":"This was my first time trying laksa and it was pretty good! At this restaurant there are two options for laksa, large or small. The large is $7.50 and the small is $5.30. I found the small to be plenty, my husband had large and he didn't finish it all. \u00c2\u00a0They also have some appetizer items which we did not try. You might want to bring your own napkin as you have to buy them for 30 cents if you need them.","605":"My nose didn't stop running the whole time I ate this(Laksa). Not pepper burn \"hot\", but more chili (nose run) \"hot\". Once you start, you can't stop. Very addictive and tasty. \u00c2\u00a0For my fellow Americans, don't be afraid of the fish cake. Not what I expected. Was very good.My first laksa experience was a winner.","606":"Supaya dapat (SIM surat ijin mancing) next trip, sogok dulu pemilik SIM dengan 328 Katong laksa yang hmmmm wangi dan enaknya.Food : 4.5\/5Service : 3\/5Price : $$Place : 3\/5.HalalRest : 328 Katong LaksaLocation : East coast roadCity : Singapore.","607":"This spot was convenient since it was right across the street from our hotel. The laksa was tasty and delicious.","608":"The Naked FinnWell known for its seafood for dinner which I have tried many times before. Always good especially their cold vermicelli, prawns & tiny squids. Had lunch here for the first time. Limited menu; both seafood & local food.Lobster roll was good. Lobster was not overcooked.","609":"Naked Finn has a bar called Nekkid nearby.Keep seeing my hairdresser posting all the yummy food from here. Finally had it last Saturday night. Good food.Nice ambience.5 of us shared one Set (a) and one Set (b). Was enough food.Liked the kang kong, loved crispy squid, the bee hoon and the scallop carpaccio.Barramundi Fish was good.Prawn with the sauce was good but not great although the waiter seemed to think they were great.","610":"I recently traveled to Singapore for the first time. From what I had heard leading up to my trip was that it was a very clean country with excellent food. Both rang true from my experience. I found the Naked Fin on yelp by looking up restaurants around me. I love to pair my food with a good glass of wine and the images provided on their yelp page won me over immediately. Most of the restaurants here don't offer a drink list and are small pop-up shops that are outdoors and the humidity has been a bit of a change from my SoCal weather. Haha so that's why The Naked Fin stood out to me. Further more there was a video. It was a quick little blurb about the owner and how The Naked Fin got started. \u00c2\u00a0It gave all the more reassurance this would be the experience I was hoping for. Once I arrived it was what I expected and more. The food cooking in the back smelt great they staff was so greeting and really helped me pick what would be best for me as I didn't understand most of the menu and terminology. The big reason I wanted to go as well was this Baby Indian Squid App that I saw in the video and on their yelp page. I have enclosed a photo. OMG! It was even better than I imagined. It tasted like crispy sesame seed oil. They cooked them just right and I was so happy I got them. The prawn soup was great as well. It pair great with the white wine (I would compare to a Pino Grigio) they went excellent together and I was very happy with the service food and over all experience here. If you're in Singapore The Naked Fin is a MUST TRY!","611":"Outstanding lunch place away from town. We had the prawn noodles, lobster roll and baby squid. Everything was impressively sourced, particularly the squid and prawns. Service was excellent as well. Will be back!","612":"Love the space. If anyone remember Klee (now defunct cocktail bar that was too early for its time) at Portsdown Road, this place reminds me of it, except that it is way more than just a cocktail bar.We hiked down to Gillman Village, firstly to get a drink, plus to try out the prawn vermicelli that received a glowing review in the Straits Times. The prawn vermicelli is served as a supper menu item, from 10pm on weekdays and 10.30pm on weekends. The prawn broth is made by frying amaebi shrimps and Sakura ebi, then simmered in pork stock for 7 hours. When served, the server will reiterate that there is absolutely no sugar or seasoning added. Your bowl of yumminess is served with 4 choices of grilled shrimps (banana, giant tiger, gamba espanola, gamba carabinero) on the side. You are also given a condiment tray: sea salt, Japanese spice, chilli powder, plus get this......pork lard made from iberico jamon.All those of course comes with a price. We went with the gamba espanola, which has a large head that comes with the most amazing roe. Slurp it all up from the head and you are in gamba haven. The flesh of this shrimp is not firm like our usual shrimps, but the taste of the roe more than made up for it. One of this shrimp comes in at $15 on their ala carte menu...Other dishes we had:- diver-caught Atlantic scallops cerviche - while it was awesome, it is also much too expensive at $20 for two bite size portion. I understand that this will cost much more at a sushi restaurant, but still...- grilled baby Indian squids - so good. Done in all natural goodness without batter so you really taste the succulent juiciness and with a slight smokey crispness at the edge. I can eat this forever.- pan-fried fish. Can't remember which fish we had but it came with an awesomely crispy skin.Started off with some very fruity cocktails. All the cocktails are deliciously fruity yet strong. The kyoho grape one is full of the beautiful notes of this amazing fruit, pulp included so that you are sure this is the real deal. Strangely, the drinks are served kind of ice-blended, so you do get a brain freeze if you drink it immediately.Menu is strictly seafood. If you are allergic to seafood, or looking for meats, avoid this place. The pricing is on the high side but they pride themselves on quality seafood.","613":"I really want to like this place more, but I couldn't.Yes, I do appreciate the effort taken to source the freshest ingredients, the lengths gone to prepare a tasty broth, etc.I also understand the high costs of operating, and the fact that quality seafood costs a lot in Singapore.The food is indeed delicious. But it lacks a wow factor needed to make up for the high price.","614":"The Naked Finn is run by Ken Loon whom I met through a friend. \u00c2\u00a0Since I was in Singapore he invited me to his restaurant and I spent an evening chatting with him and enjoying his food.As is always a good idea, I let the host choose the menu, so Ken got us an assortment including squid, fish, scallop, pork, risotto etc. \u00c2\u00a0All of which was very good, though if I am going to pick favorites, the squid was really special. \u00c2\u00a0Grilled to perfection and just the right consistency. \u00c2\u00a0This is something I am going to miss when going back to Norway.Okay, I'm going to pick one more favorite: \u00c2\u00a0the pork. \u00c2\u00a0Incredibly tender and juicy shoulder of iberico pork (if I am not mistaken). \u00c2\u00a0 I ate most of it without any form of sauce or condiments. \u00c2\u00a0It was just so good by itself.I also got a tour of the fish tanks and the kitchen. \u00c2\u00a0 The place has a very modern feel while at the same time feeling human-centric. \u00c2\u00a0Ken has his books and his desk out in the restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0Including his big stack of papers on bivalves :-).The fish we had (I don't remember the name of the species. \u00c2\u00a0I don' think it is something I've had before), Ken had caught himself. \u00c2\u00a0He has a very hands-on approach with the raw materials which reminds me a bit about F\u00c3\u00a4viken.I like down-to-earth restaurant experiences that is about good food and good conversation. \u00c2\u00a0And this is as good as it gets.I had an excellent evening!(To my Norwegian friends: \u00c2\u00a0the name of the restaurant has nothing to do with naked people from Finland. \u00c2\u00a0I suggest you visit the restaurant and ask for yourself what the name means)","615":"They serve the BEST cocktails you can ever find in Singapore!I love the fact that they live up to their name of being \"naked\", for the fact that the ingredients used in the choice of seafood are simply salt, pepper and olive oil to bring out the freshness in their seafood!The cocktails, served at -12\u00c2\u00b0C, taste FRESH!Made my first visit there from friend's recommendation and tried all of their 3 signature cocktails, Strawberry, Coconut and Kyoho grapes.The ingredients are freshly pacotized (according to their website), and it seriously brought me to heaven!Ordered a portion of baby squids for sharing (as it was rather late that night, that we headed there for some really chill night out) - SO FRESH!I have never imagined that COCONUT can make such an awesome ingredient for a cocktail. lovely surprise!p.s. waiter was SO NICE, and asked us \"is everything ok?\" after serving. top notch!I love that place, the environment (can get really quiet as they have limited tables), the drinks, the food!Gonna frequent this place whenever I have some cocktail cravings!","616":"What a hidden gem inside Gilman Barrack! After some gallery hopping a group of us came for dinner. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of food. The restaurant only have less than 8 tables so I'd recommend making a ressy ahead of time.We started with some razor clam ceviche and baby squid, both very fresh and delicately seasoned. For entr\u00c3\u00a9e we had their iberico pork and grilled fish, both cooked to near perfection. Will definitely be back for more!","617":"5 stars cos it's so hard to fault this little gem. From the service experience while booking the place to the actual dinning experience, it's one of the best I've experienced in this part of the world. The space itself is great. Small and cosy but doesn't feel cramped at all. Unpretentious with IKEA kitchenware and yet tasteful at the same time. Music's at the perfect volume and playlist is legit. Food is just delightful. Fresh and thoughtfully put together. Me and the missus had the set dinner for 2 and every dish that came with it was really tasty. The cocktails are amazing as well. Simple yet punchy. Most of all, the people there are lovely. They all looked like they really love what they do, and was informative and engaged throughout the night. Go, if you want a charming, non-pretentious and overall great dining experience.","618":"LIKE.The perfect ending to any Gillman Barracks visit (or rather hike) is a dinner at the Naked Finn. Service is great, dishes are great, the place is great. There isn't much I could complain about... Well, maybe the music was a tad 1980s ballad-ish, but I can forgive that considering how rarely I find a gem amidst Singapore's great, big culinary landscape.We ordered the chilled bee hoon which was fantastic. It's large so order it to share. The squid, the prawns, the fish - all the seafoods were grilled, seared and fried to perfection. The wine list wasn't over-whelming but instead offered good, simple, unpretentious choices. Add to the evening some pretty fantastic cocktails (our favourite du soir was the coconut one) and it's about as good a meal as one can find.Oh and the cherry on top: the prices were very reasonable.Have you sensed that I really like this place yet?","619":"We went to this restaurant because of its reputation for simple good food. We decided to go for lunch. The restaurant is a shack located in isolation next to a running track. \u00c2\u00a0Would have had a hard time locating it if not for my trusty GPS. The restaurant is small, so reservations are a must. You need to call them in the afternoon otherwise no one answers the phone. The lunch menu is simple and uncomplicated. We had the lobster roll with creme freche and a fish and chips. The roll was excellent with generous portions of lobster cooked well. Likewise the fish and chips though I think it was a tad overdone. The fish they use is the ling fish. Line caught and very good. Price wise is a little high, but with 3 portions of lobster what do you expect. The meal for 6 persons including 4 chendol deserts was $255","620":"expensive seafood at this uppity too-cool-for-school restaurant at the gilman barracks. this place - well. the food is good (let's get it out of the way), but it's simply cooked, it's simply expensive, and service is pretty inadequate for the price you're paying.I simply don't understand the hype - seafood is abundant in singapore, and a more-than-decent dish is more than easily found (even at your neighborhood czechar store) - it's the sort of seafood restaurant I'd imagine in a land-locked part of the US, where seafood is both posh and inaccessible.but I'll give it to them that the seafood is fresh and delicious in its simplicity, but I'd hazard a guess, too, that anyone with half-decent cooking skills can churn out similar dishes.the most economical option here would be to take their set menu (which is still pretty price-hefty) for a taster of their dishes. it starts with a simply dressed salad, and fried vermicelli noodles (simpler-ly known as fried beehoon in this part of the world) are brought to the table as accompaniment to the subsequent dishes.and it's good right, but a lot of it is due in part to the fresh produce they've got (which is admirable) as opposed to any particular skill (which is the point of visiting restaurants). not that not-overcooking seafood is not a skill (omg, triple negatives!) - but it's a pretty basic one.fat, plump clams in an easily-drinkable, more-ish soup that went well with the beehoon, and plainly seared scallops served in-shell with garlic. plump and sweet, those were delicious.these were followed by grilled mozambique - read: skinny - lobsters that had a good charred flavor, the same of which you could smell and taste in the seared fish and baby squid. that baby squid was pretty delicious - they were chewy but tender, with none of that crisp nothingness that happens with deep-frying.so the food was good - even if I might complain about price - but service is pretty hit-miss. the good thing was that we had chirpy waiters dishing up our food - but we had to be chased out after barely two hours of a long many-coursed dinner (such is the quirk of trendy, busy restaurants), and they refused to bring me a glass of water when I first walked in (IT'S SELF-SERVICE, PLEASE) even though there was no one else in the restaurant and the waiters were milling about.","621":"Nice \"for a change\" sort of place to have lunch. You know the food's good when the lunch crowd is decent despite the out of the way location. We got the prawn mee, which was nice. Not quite as \"strong\" as the soup from the more traditional prawn mee places (e.g. the one at Pepys Road), but things came together well. Would have been nicer if the stock came out piping hot. Desserts are ok.","622":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but this place is great -- really fresh, simply prepared, high quality seafood. Reminded me of trendy places in Boston or San Francisco. Ambience was cool -- quiet, cool music, intimate, slightly hipster. Service was so, so good. We had:- Scallop ceviche style - this was awesome, my favorite of the night. Lemony and garlicky but also light. - Scallop seared - good but the garlic was a bit overpowering on this one- Pumpkin cream soup - really nice and filling, paired well with the garlic flavors of my mains. - Baby squids - overly generous portion, sort of fried but without much seasoning- Barramundi - really flavorful and fresh, with good portion size; could have had this as the main dish only- Noodles - good complement but not necessaryOh my gosh, and the cocktails are amazing. Worth a trip there for the cocktails alone.","623":"The 2 person seafood set at $120 sounds pricey but given the high standard of preparation its not unreasonable:Eat as much as you like beehoon, cooked to perfectionGrilled razor clams, giant sized:)Littleneck clams - some of the sweetest I've hadGrilled shrimp - sweeter than most prawns one getsPan-friedn barramundiGrilled lobster but really it what Aussies like to call a yabbie Blanched kang kong - great way of serving something so familiarA good choice of wine if a short wine list, but should be something for everyone. Red wine was chilled :( minus one star.","624":"I rate the Naked Finn and I will be coming back. I'll state that upfront.I went yesterday night again..drinks with friends from work with bites...Dinner for them, half dinner for me. My rating is 4 stars overall because there are a few misses. Overall still a solid choice and the service was helpful and pleasant.Here's the rundown:Cocktails1) coconut - Yes! I finally got to try it. This was our top pick o the night. They blended the flesh in as well which gave the slushy sorbet a creamier texture. Very coconuty..but you know how some coconuts taste old. This tasted like the sweetest freshest thai coconut had been used. Friends all loved it after tasting mine.2) white peach bellini - friend had this. It was refreshing.3) melon with the hendrick's gin - this was more subtle. melon taste was there but it was definitely less sweet and had a bit of bitterness. I wasn't sure if it was from the rind of the melon but my friend thought it was the gin.4) orange guava cocktail - I had this before so I didn't try. My friend said nice but a bit too sweet. She said her first drink the bellini was better.5) mojito - we all thought this had hardly enough sugar or none in it. My friend asked for sugar syrup to add up. Because of the addition of the orion beer, this was quite a light tasting cocktail. I wouldn't order it again.6) kalamansi - I wanted something sour and this was indeed sour. In fact my friends all made faces when they tried and said it was too much. While I did enjoy it..towards the end I found it too much and I actually left some in the glass. Only if you REALLY like sour. On hindsight I wish I had ordered 2 coconuts hahaFood:1) baby squids - YUMS! Simply grilled, juicy..lots of flavour.2) clams in white wine - needed more white wine. My friends said it was very \"healthy\" and I should have more as I was under the weather.3) cold bee hoon - lightly seasoned, not greasy with a tang of lemon. really nice complement to the food..or just eat it on its own..or drizzle it with the above said clam broth to elevate the clam broth (haha rather than the other way round)4) northern prawns - predominant impression was salty. Gavin did explain they overcook these a bit so the shells can be eaten. I saw another lady eating the big prawns and those looked really juicy which was more the kind of prawns I was expecting.5) razor clams - $12 a piece but surprisingly meaty. fresh and yummy. although they drizzled with shallot oil, it didn't taste oily.Staff were rather busy but responsive. It's a tiny place so it's hard to do a big group unless you book early.","625":"Went here very spontaneously last night for a drink after a long day at work. Had dinner at home..felt something was missing. Naked Finn came to mind. Called them at 11pm and they said the last order for food was past at 10:30pm. I said I'm really just needing a drink and they said last order for that is 11:30 and to come on down.Was a little surprised to see it. Tiny glass house. Loved the look as it was clean and white. I'm a modernist at heart. Felt much roomier than I expected inside but I think that's because it was quiet. They had a long table setup inside with a group and another table in the corner and about 6 chairs along the bar. Bar seats were large and spaced out and it helped I could waltz (stumble?) right in and drag myself straight onto a high chair. Menus were presented. I asked the bartender Gavin what he thought...He explained that basically cocktails there are sorbet based (signature cocktails) and classics which were a lot of South American (Mojitos, capirinhas but with their spin on it).We went back and forth..hey I was only having one drink and I had to make it count. Needed a pick me up. Finally settled on the coconut (note the signature drinks don't have names but have the list of ingredients but they're often called after the first ingredient). I love fresh coconut and he said it was one of their most popular drinks. I was intrigued by the kalamansi and sour prune one as my original thought was refreshing and sour (same brief I gave to Zach at Suprette a few nights ago).Turns out coconut was sold out. Doh! Brother meanwhile was a little impatient waiting for me as he had settled on his \"orange guava\" very quickly (with kronenbourg blanc 1664) while Gavin was very patiently going through the menu with me. Don't get me wrong..he was recommending but I was vacillating (did I spell that right? That was one strong drink! More on that later..)In the end he recommended I go for the pear, the last on the signature list. I did mention the kalamansi sour prune a few times but he didn't dwell on it. I should make it a mission to go back and have that.I had gotten there just before 1130 and with all the discussion on drinks, he said bar snacks were still available and he did check with us later as well before the kitchen started washing up.Ok..verdict. My brother liked his drink very much. I had a taste. We talked about how it was yummy, could definitely taste the orange and guava and it was nicely balanced. My drink was served in a big martini glass all frosted up and it was refreshing and had all the different flavours showing. Gavin showed me the liqueur eau de vie Poire Williams bottle (Menu misspelled it as view I realise now typing this) and asked me to take a sniff, it was peary! He said it was very strong and they only put 5ml in. It said 43% on the bottle. I did a wiki and it's a fruity clear brandy made from Williams or Bartlet pears. Again, I enjoyed that the drink was nicely balanced and tasty and you could also taste the cucumber which was the last ingredient (cucumber infused vodka).Had a nice chat with Gavin, he was from Barstories previously. I said I would be back and would try to bring my friend who had brought me to Barstories before. He explained the name from the book Great Expectations and said they would do a movie screening of the same later in January.Drinks were mostly $18 or $20, no service charge but add GST . Must have been stronger than I thought coz I had the one drink in a big martini glass and I had to concentrate very slightly to walk straight haha! I looked at food menu. All seafood. They had a platter for 1 at $88 or a platter for 2 \u00c2\u00a0at $128 which they recommended as they said going ala carte is less food for more money.We were the last in..first out. I just needed something easy on a whim and we got that so 5 stars for the experience, friendliness and drinks. We had parked on the grass edge outside which assisted in the waltzing in and out.Easy parking. checkEasy stress-free experience. checkYummy cold drink for $20. checkFriendly patient bartender. checkPicked me up. check","626":"Look, the big tip for this place is to listen to what they are pimping that evening and order that. There are no two ways when it comes to seafood. You can't do anything if the produce is below par, and with their minimal cooking methods they can't risk it either. We (over)ordered an extra fish that the restaurant \u00c2\u00a0was not recommending and it took the edge off an otherwise good meal.Other than that, YES, do visit, keep the ordering sane, have a cocktail or a nice craft beer and enjoy the evening and the peaceful surroundings. I'm coming back.","627":"Since dining almost 2 years ago, The Naked Finn has moved to new premises, barely 100 meters away from their old haunt, which is, incidentally, now its sister bar. Its greenhouse aesthetic is maintained, so you get an expansive view of the lush surrounds of Gillman Barracks. It's a terrific escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Be sure to make reservations though, it was a busy full house on a Friday afternoon when we popped by for lunch.Very little is done to the seafood, which is fresh and sweet. If you thought that read bland food, you'd be mightily mistaken. The food here is hearty and soulful, and robust with flavour. It's just that when the ingredient's that fresh and sweet, very little needs to be done to it.We had:1) Grilled Indian Baby Squid ($8) - seasoned simply with a flick of sea salt and slick of olive oil: must try. Soft, sweet and succulent2) Beef Burger ($23): At first blush, it looked disappointingly minuscule. But (some, not all) good things come in small packages, and this turned out an indulgent, finger-licking-good powerhouse. The decadent grass-fed dry-aged Japanese wagyu patty, dripping with juices, came together with the Boston lettuce, American cheese, and special sauce brilliantly. Just be sure to get double (or triple) orders of this if you're hungry.3) Pan-fried Barramundi Fillet ($20): paper-crisp skin and moist flaky meat. This was seasoned with olive oil and finished with sea salt, accompanied by a mound of blanched kangkong tossed in kalamansi juice, dried shrimp, and shallot oil, and vermicelli oiled in sesame and fried garlic bits, both served refreshingly chilled4) Hae Mee Tng ($25): a medley of farmed giant tiger prawns, Salmon Creek Farms pork belly, in a blended soup of 9 prawn species and simmered pork bones. This was rich and sweet but not cloying, as The Naked Finn resists the addition of MSG or sugar. Get the vermicelli for a traditional option, or the Japanese somen for a twist on the classic. 5) Homemade Naked Chendol ($13) with coconut sorbet: deconstructed version of a local classic, but refreshingly lovely6) Homemade Gula Melaka Sorbet with Sea Salt ($10): a twist on the flavour du jour, salted caramel. An absolute must-try.7) Homemade Sour Plum Sorbet ($10) with osmanthus jelly: recommended if you prefer a tangy refreshing end to your meal","628":"It is a hide away from the hectic city. A delightful cocktail bar with simple honest dishes. I enjoy the flavorful concoctions along with their seasonal changes. The boys do a great job at introducing you with the menu. They are also brilliantly smart at pairings and precise with measurements, so if you have the time and right company, sit by the bar for a nice show. Their bee hoon is a must. I only say this because I have a weakness for spicy food and they spoil me with four different types of chilies. Life can't get better. Yes it is out of the way, but that is the pleasure of being there. Keep up the great work guys.","629":"Celebrated my nieces birthday dinner here. First time to Cut and it was awesome!!! Kobe beef steak was incredible as was the service. Thank you!!","630":"One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.Starters are amazing - we ordered the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a whileIf you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationService was really slow and not attentive \/ definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating.","631":"I've been craving for steak this past week and finally decided to stop by this location. The filet mignon was tender, flavorful and delicious. I was too hungry so I devoured it before taking any pictures \u00c2\u00a0The bone marrow was mouth watering. All staff members were attentive without being too excessive. Glynn, the manager at CUT, definitely made my short visit to Singapore a 10\/10 experience. She volunteered to call the souvenir shop within Marina Bay Hotel twice to verify its location and look up some information for me. Glynn also recommended a popular drink of the restaurant, \"Rough Love.\" Unique and easy to drink. You should try it! I attached the picture below. Thank you everyone at the CUT for an amazing meal and experience!","632":"Superb service. You can't expect anything less from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. And it's at the Marina Bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here.Plenty of steaks to choose from. They also make some good cocktails.Again service was great. They kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met. Reservations are recommended although I'm sure they can squeeze you in.","633":"Just wanted to say thanks to Mary and the people at CUT who made for a very special evening. Had the Porterhouse for 2 perfectly cooked to medium rare. Service was excellent. Was given a nice little surprise at the end of the meal to celebrate an engagement. I'm glad I chose this place. It was worth it.","634":"One of the best steaks I have ever tasted.We went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people, portion wise. It comes with two sauces and 4 different mustards. The steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it. Ordered kale and the patata as sides. The patata was really good as well.Finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert. They were ok but nothing special, wouldn't mind skipping them next time.","635":"I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w\/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!!

He now ranks amongst the best chefs\/restaurateurs in the world, and \"Spago\" in LA is an institution that has found worldwide fame, now present in many locations, Singapore included. Another venture of his is CUT, focusing on steak. We booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously.As there are many other reviews raving about this place I'm trying to keep it short, hoping to contribute to a coherent picture.Service is very friendly, efficient, and, which I always find refreshing at \"celebrity restaurants\", authentic. No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern\/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab\/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from \"the usual\". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))","637":"Came here on a pretty amazing, random whim with a great gentleman & his crew while visiting Singapore. My goodness... The presentation & flavor of the drinks & food were AMAZING. And orgasmic. How they made carrots, Mac & cheese, mini Kobe burgers, fish tacos, & potatoes (all separate dishes) taste like culinary heaven is beyond me. The bartender and servers were courteous & lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.","638":"This has got to be the best steak house I have ever experienced. I am formerly of New York City and had my fair share of solid steaks. I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative \"mixology\" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their \"spiked\" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)","639":"Event Planners - Beware! I am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience. I gave 2 stars because the food and service was good, the management team organizing was not. I felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because I was not onsite to confirm. I was also charged a higher amount on wine as they didn't have the type I chose of which I am still awaiting a refund, from early March. The communication has been slow and not genuine. My concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager.","640":"I took my husband here for his birthday while in Singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we've been to. The server was A+ & so was dinner. My favorite was my mocktail (apple, cucumber, & basil).What a great experience? Needless to say, he enjoyed his birthday.","641":"Best steaks in town!The Kobe steak is just amazing! I had the filet mignon. The pork belly starter was also really good.","642":"I took myself on Valentine's Day after working a long day. For starters, the bread was delish. I preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter. I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl\u00c3\u00a9. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!","643":"This is probably the best steak house in Singapore ! We ordered the wagu grade 8 steak. It literally melt in our mouths ! We started with the tuna tartar. ExcellentThen we had the steak that was shared. \u00c2\u00a0Heaven Wine was ok , on the expensive side. \u00c2\u00a0They won't allowed us to bring our own ! \u00c2\u00a0A bit of a downer We finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. A highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least $200+ per person.","644":"Dined here a few weeks ago. \u00c2\u00a0Crab cakes, butter lettuce, filet with the apple crumble dessert. \u00c2\u00a0Enjoyed it very much. Filet was excellently prepared. Would definitely return here next time.","645":"I really don't have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the LA version, which usually annoys me. \u00c2\u00a0From what I recall, they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends. We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York. \u00c2\u00a0D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point. \u00c2\u00a0On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair. Overall, a place to go in Singapore when you're missing some good quality meat in your life!","646":"The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes.","647":"CUT is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world, offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from Japan.The menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what I would expect in a West Coast or Las Vegas steakhouse (no surprise)--contemporary, minimalist furnishing and decor. \u00c2\u00a0Small plates with a modern cuisine flair, like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce. \u00c2\u00a0The US Angus filet I had was absolutely spot on and delicious.The wine list had a pretty good range in the by-the-glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails--classic and innovative both.Stylistically I prefer the 'old school' New York\/Chicago style steakhouses (this I would not categorize as \"Traditional American Restaurants\")--where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal. \u00c2\u00a0So while I enjoyed my experience, the match goes to other team--particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it's up against.","648":"Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking...But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost.","649":"Celebrated my nieces birthday dinner here. First time to Cut and it was awesome!!! Kobe beef steak was incredible as was the service. Thank you!!","650":"One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.Starters are amazing - we ordered the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a whileIf you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationService was really slow and not attentive \/ definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating.","651":"I've been craving for steak this past week and finally decided to stop by this location. The filet mignon was tender, flavorful and delicious. I was too hungry so I devoured it before taking any pictures \u00c2\u00a0The bone marrow was mouth watering. All staff members were attentive without being too excessive. Glynn, the manager at CUT, definitely made my short visit to Singapore a 10\/10 experience. She volunteered to call the souvenir shop within Marina Bay Hotel twice to verify its location and look up some information for me. Glynn also recommended a popular drink of the restaurant, \"Rough Love.\" Unique and easy to drink. You should try it! I attached the picture below. Thank you everyone at the CUT for an amazing meal and experience!","652":"Superb service. You can't expect anything less from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. And it's at the Marina Bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here.Plenty of steaks to choose from. They also make some good cocktails.Again service was great. They kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met. Reservations are recommended although I'm sure they can squeeze you in.","653":"Just wanted to say thanks to Mary and the people at CUT who made for a very special evening. Had the Porterhouse for 2 perfectly cooked to medium rare. Service was excellent. Was given a nice little surprise at the end of the meal to celebrate an engagement. I'm glad I chose this place. It was worth it.","654":"One of the best steaks I have ever tasted.We went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people, portion wise. It comes with two sauces and 4 different mustards. The steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it. Ordered kale and the patata as sides. The patata was really good as well.Finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert. They were ok but nothing special, wouldn't mind skipping them next time.","655":"I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items.

On a typical trip I will have at least one lunch and one dinner at this great place. The crab meat spring rolls, mango salad and stuffed chicken wing appetizers are amazing.

Not very busy and we were seated immediately. We were in a hurry and they were efficient. My local friend ordered: Olive Fried Rice, Pandan Chicken, Crab Spring Roll, Pomelo Salad. The salad was incredibly refreshing with a hint of spice. Juicy pomelo and crunchy cashews \u00c2\u00a0worked well together.The Spring roll was hot and had a great crab flavor; it was served with a sweet chili sauce The Chicken had great flavor and was served with the same sweet chili sauce. The boneless chicken thighs were wrapped in Padan leaves which contributed to the flavor. Chicken thighs were tender and not dry. Rice was good and came with lime, onion, small fried shrimp, and sweet meat.We had a refreshing dessert that was like tapioca pudding and shave ice combo with mango, coconut, and red fruit. \u00c2\u00a0Delicious! Service was great. Menu is beautiful. Atmosphere relaxing.","675":"Went there for dinner. Good vegetarian options although they are not listed in the menu. Green curry and mango sticy rice were awesome. Pad Thai was too heavy on the sauce.

The restaurant used to be located in Sembawang 16 years ago, and relocated to its current location in 2013\/ 2014. A couple of years ago there was a change of owners with the menu given a makeover.Looking through the menu, one could not help but notice the uncommon dishes such as Miang Kham and Kra Por Pla Phad Hang.Yam Som O ($12+ small \/ $18+ medium)Pomelo Saladpomelo with minced pork, prawns and peanutsI usually avoided pomelo as it usually tasted sour to me. But here it was juicy sweet, with the meat giving it a savoury taste too.Miang Kham ($12+ small \/ $18+ medium)Betel Leaf Wrapthai betel leaf with dried shrimps, roasted peanuts, roasted coconut, chilli, lime, ginger and onions with a savoury dipThis dish was seldom found in the menu in Thai restaurants in Singapore, as lots of effort was needed to prepare the ingredients such as the finely roasted coconut. It was like having rojak in the mouth with the prawn paste taste, spicy chilli padi, nutty peanuts, fragrant coconut in it.Khor Moo Kurobuta Yang ($22+)Grilled Kurobuta Pork Collargrilled kurobuta pork collar accompanied with homemade spicy sauceIt looked like well charred char siew when served. It was well paired with accompanying tangy sauce.Gaeng Phed Ped Yang ($17+)Panaeng Red Curry Roast Duckpanaeng red curry with roast duck, lychees and pineapplesThe red curry was not as spicy as expected. It was rich and creamy, which made it nice to go with plain rice, with the juicy pieces of fruit giving it a burst of sweetness.Hor Mok Talay Khanom Krok ($10+\/ 4 pieces, $16+\/ 7 pieces)Thai Style Otah on Clayplatemackerel fish mousse with thai herbs served in traditional clayplateThe dish was served on cute looking plate which was specially ordered from Thailand. The otah was bouncy and juicy in texture, packed with juicy pieces of seafood in it.Neau Ribeye Black Angus Yang ($32+)Pan Seared Black Angus Beef Ribeye220g black angus ribeye beef accompanied with green curry sauceIt reminded one of steak served with b\u00c3\u00a9arnaise sauce when served, with the meat sliced into strips for easy handling. On its own, the meat was juicy and tender without overcooked. With the sauce, it was rich and creamy with a green curry aftertaste, which some may felt that it overwhelmed the original taste of the meat.Kra Por Pla Phad Hang ($14+ small \/ $20+ medium)Fried Fish Maw with Beansproutsstir fried beansprouts with fish maw and eggsFish maw was usually used in soup dishes, one seldom saw it in a stir fried dish. Although it was stir fried, it remained soft and spongy. Khao Phad Nam Liap ($14+ small \/ $20+ medium)Sawadee Olive Fried Ricestir fried olive rice with chicken strips, dried shrimps, lime and chilliThe purplish looking rice was fragrant on its own, served with sliced shallots, cubes of juicy sweet lime, crunchy dried shrimps, chopped spicy chilli padi, crunchy deep fried minced garlic. It was a party in the mouth with spicy, savoury, sweet flavours, plus the different textures.Khao Phad Talay ($18+ small \/ $28+ medium) Superior Seafood Fried Ricestir fried rice with crab meat, prawns and conpoyIt may looked average, but the crispy fine conpoy provided an extra pop in texture.Khao Neow Turian ($12+)Mao Shan Wang Durian Sticky Ricepremium durian mao shan wang with glutinous rice topped with sesame seedsAs Mao Shan Wang was not available, it was replaced with D24 durian puree. The durian puree was rich and creamy with taste more on the sweet and balanced off with the chewy sticky rice.Khao Neow Ma Muang ($7+)Mango Sticky Ricemango with butterfly pea flower glutinous rice topped with roasted mung beansThe mango was chunky and juicy sweet, balanced with the sticky rice, topped with mung beans which gave an extra crunchy texture.Tup Tim Krob ($6+)Red Rubywater chestnut with jackfruit, coconut flesh and coconut milkThere was lots of liao in it, such as the red colored crunchy water chestnut, crunchy sea coconut, soft strips of jackfruit, and coconut flesh. It would be best to have this as soon as it was served as the shaved ice melted rather fast.Butterfly Pea Flower Tea ($5.50+)The drink was blue in color and served with lime juice by the side. When lime juice was added, the drink changed from blue to purple in color. The drink was more like a lemonade with slight tea taste in the aftertaste.","677":"Really good Thai. Fresh spicy intense mixture of spice. Tom Yan is awesome. Great seating, clean, very hospitable.","678":"If the soup is a key to excellence then this establishment held out the promise of authenticity. The dishes were carefully seasoned to appeal to the Thai \u00c2\u00a0gourmand The Pad Thai was a bit heavy on sauce. \u00c2\u00a0The one disappointing weakness was in the management and service. Table service was provided without smile or comment. \u00c2\u00a0It is our hope that Joy and Thai smiles can save this establishment.","679":"This is my 2nd visit to Sawasdee. \u00c2\u00a0The first time I visited was in 2015 and I was not a vegan. \u00c2\u00a0I actually took a picture of the menu because it was so good. \u00c2\u00a0I wanted to make sure that if I ever returned to Singapore, I would return to eat at this restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0Fast forward 2 1\/2 Years later I returned, but this time as a vegan. \u00c2\u00a0I was sooo happy to find out they have a vegan menu! \u00c2\u00a0The food was so awesome I returned for a 2nd visit before I left the country!","680":"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had. Went with the standbys of papaya salad, Tom kha gai, pad Thai, chicken green curry. All great. Washed down with Tiger beer on tap. Superb dinner.","681":"I stumbled upon this place accidentally thanks to google but have been really glad I found it. I have to admit, they're not THE best Thai food you'll find in sg but they are decently quite good. (Yes they've been around 15 years and this is the first time mountain tortoise boy has heard of it)We've had the green curry, tom yum pla, vermicelli salad, Thai otah, beef with lemongrass, squid, rice crackers and their signature duck curry. Now where do I start. From the moment we stepped in on the first day, we loved the smell of the food filled the restaurant. That salty tangy smell that comes from all good establishments was ever present in the restaurant, good start! Looking through the menu, you'd find the familiar dishes across all Thai restaurants in Singapore. Green curry, tom yum soup etc. I'm not going to reveal all the dishes we've tried, but The top 3 dishes.Our top 3 dishes (in no particular order): 1) Duck Curry Described to be cooked in a rich, thick curry, this curry does not disappointment. The flavours that come screaming through the dish is amazing and if you're looking for a curry with a punch, this is it! It's the kind of rich, Savoury curry you would want to have on a cold rainy day and the flavour of duck certainly shines through, making sure that this dish is elevated with that rich flavour you can only get from a duck. Although there was some inconsistency (the first time we had it it was served with lychees but the 2nd time was with pineapple), it was still a great dish! Fruits with curry?? Eeeew? Trust me. The sweetness of the fruit cuts through the richness beautifully and in fact, elevates the herbs and spices used in the dish. 2) Thai Style SquidThere is an option here to have the dish less spicy for the non-chilli fans but the star of this dish is definitely the squid. Cooked to perfection, each bite give you a piece of soft, tender squid bursting with flavour, and that's what we loved about it. The soft tender squid. More often than not, most restaurants tend to murder the squid, cooking it till an almost rubber band texture but not here. Each bit of the squid rings shows you how much care goes into the food here, ensuring that the squid should be perfect. 3) Thai OtahWe've seen tons of rendition of this popular Thai dish, some hitting the mark while others tasting like it came out of muar (no insult to muar otah coz I absolutely love it but it isn't Thai). Mixed with fish paste, prawn and what I thought was bamboo shoots, the otah here is delightful. The sweetness of the seafood dancing with your palette while ensuring that the chilli doesn't wreck havoc after, is a fantastic achievement. Just enough chilli is tingle your tongue but not enough to make your food tasteless. Now with every restaurant, there are some misses and this is no exception. The green curry here is a can miss. Though fragrant, it isn't quite the rich green curry you might hope to get and the rice crackers with creamy chicken, though a good try, doesn't give you that same satisfaction as it would while eating it in Thailand. A notable mention would go out to their tom yum soup. Close to being one of our favourite, except the fact that it was a tad too spicy. Chilli fans will love it though as the soup really whets your appetite but for the non-chilli eaters, you might find this a tad bit too spicy for your liking. The fact that we've been here 3 times in 2 weeks goes to show how much we love it. Plus the fact that for the same price as that overly commercialized Thai \"speciality\" restaurant in Singapore, this restaurant certainly gets my vote.","682":"Many good reviews made us visit this restaurant. During the evening the tables did indeed fill quickly, speaking for its good reputation.Alas, we were disappointed. The food tasted as good as expected and was arranged nicely. But that's little consolidation when half of what's being brought isn't the food you ordered. We should've taken the hint that we had to repeat every single dish number a minimum of FIVE times during ordering for the lady to get it right. Or at least so we thought. Turned out that still every other dish was noted wrong.\"We'd like number 13\".\"30?\"\"No, 13\"\"30, ah?\"\"...thirteeeeeen\"\"....thirtyyy?\"\"Look where I'm pointing - 13. 13!\"(Too short sighted, but now confused) \"tree-oh?\"\"Eleven, twelve, thirteen. We'd like number thirteen\"\"Ah, one-tree. Ok\" (writes down 30)Unfortunately, while funny when reading, experiencing this makes a guest rather uncomfortable. And having to order again during the dinner fills the stomach with waiting upon a half empty table. At the end we wished we had gone somewhere else. We probably won't come back due to this, but we can assure anyone else that the food looks great and tastes great, IF you can manage to get what had wanted.","683":"BBQ Crabs! \u00c2\u00a0Why haven't anyone else thought of that? \u00c2\u00a0A brilliant twist on the Teow Chew Cold Crab indeed. \u00c2\u00a0Succulent, sweet crabs stuffed with melted roe cooked to order and grilled to perfection. \u00c2\u00a0Minimal seasoning which brings out the natural flavor of the crabs and the burnt unagi sauce was indeed a nice touch. \u00c2\u00a0Definitely a welcomed change from the chili and peppered versions. \u00c2\u00a0The place is your standard kopitiam - no A\/C - but I'd rather endure the heat for tasty local food than chow down on mediocre food from air-conditioned chains... \u00c2\u00a0Remember to call ahead and reserve your crabs if you are planning to go on the weekends!","684":"Huge clumps of hair in the food, rude service and the staff thought it was OK to smoke next to our children even when a) we asked them nicely not to and b) it was a non-smoking area. They just stared aggressively when asked not to smoke. And the place was filthy. And the food not very good. Avoid.","685":"One of the best crabs in Singapore. The crabs are big and juicy. They are fresh too. I love them very much. I would recommend it.","686":"One of the best crab place in Singapore. They do not have a wide menu but focus to do the best dishes they serve.","687":"Awesome out of the way local crab. Bbq instead of slathered on chili or pepper sauce. Able to enjoy the real flavor of the crab. Cash only so come prepared. The shrimp fried rice with it was the perfect meal pairing. Enough for one. Housed within a Lebanese\/Indian restaurant house, or shared rather. So many options. Will revisit again if in the area and in the mood. Very lovely owners\/managers, especially nice to this particular American despite Trump and how many are so upset with us.","688":"A very disappointing experience. Firstly, it took me not so long to find out the restaurant is operated by two separate crews when I was shown two different menus and asked to order twice. And they are not coordinated -- each said the food on the other's menu is not available right now!Then I was told that I had to call in advance to reserve a grilled crab, after asking a few times why I couldn't have one crab while there were a lot on the grill.Okay fair enough, so I turned to the Indian crew for a pepper crab. In result I was served a chilli crab with the reason \"pepper crab is a bit spicy \".... excuse me!?","689":"If you want a simple but yummy seafood meal. This is the place. Make sure you call to make reservations. Open Mon to Sat. Closed on Sunday & Public Holidays. From 6.30 to 9.30 .. No frills, no air con but \u00c2\u00a0worth it.Best of all they play a great repertoire of oldies songs.","690":"Believe it or not, my favorite preparation of crab is simply steamed with melted salted butter. \u00c2\u00a0Happy Crab shares that philosophy with simply grilled crabs, enhanced only by a bit of salt and pepper. \u00c2\u00a0The preparation brings out the incredible natural sweet flavor of the crabs and the meat remains firm.The setting is classic Singaporean coffee shop with golden oldies on the sound system and cheerful, gourmand uncles running the show.Apart from the crabs, the grilled squid is a winner and if you need some greenery, the kai lan is pretty tasty as well.Drinks are run by a separate shop, but we noticed that some other (smart) customers brought their own chilled white wine. \u00c2\u00a0Not sure if there is any corkage fee, but I'm sure it can't be very much!PARTING THOUGHT: do be sure to reserve your crabs in advance or prepare for disappointment...1 \/ person will do nicely!","691":"Opened by a group of retired air stewards, this place was discovered thanks to my dad. Tucked away in an old coffee shop along Pahang, Happy Crab is.... How should I put it... Happy Food! If you're tired of the regular chilli, black pepper, white pepper, salted egg yolk crabs and want to taste a crab for its pure, natural flavour, than Happy Crab should automatically be your #1 choice. I'm giving this place a 5* rating, solely \u00c2\u00a0based on its crabs. Seasoned with just salt and pepper, these crabs are first cooked lightly, then thrown on a charcoal grill to give it that charred BBQ flavour. Mixed in with the natural sweetness, it makes for a killer combination! Ranging from around $35-$40 a crab, these delightful crustaceans will take away whatever craving you have for a good crab because well... They are that good!!Your first bite will bring Michael Buble's \"It's a beautiful day\" floating into your head, and you'd be clapping along to Pharrell William's \"Happy\" halfway through your dinner. The only sad thing about eating here is when you realize that... You're out of crabs! Apart from the crab, the Fried fish is pretty good too and it's sambal is delightful, but... Everything aside, this place definitely THE place to be fore grilled crabs. 2 pincers up for some awesome crabs!","692":"This has got to be one of the best crab in singapore! I love the simplicity of the dish and I would always come back - one crab is definite not enough for me.. also the Hor Fun is very very good !!!","693":"Honestly, these guys should play Pharrell's \"Happy\"at this place cause that how diners feel after a bite of that Grilled Crab!The sweetness of Sri Lankan crabs with the charred taste of the grill (ie burnt at the edges) topped with salt and pepper is just a Killer Combination. Singapore is known for crabs: chilli, pepper crab, you name it. \u00c2\u00a0I haven't ventured enough to try all the crab possibilities out on the red dot, but this indeed is one of the best grilled crab places around. \u00c2\u00a0To complement the crab, I would suggest the grilled squid and of course my favorite, rice. Not just any rice, Sambal Rice. It's a little spicy so be forewarned.The ambience is nothing to shout about. Kind of looks like your typical Singaporean hole in the wall, but then again that's how you know the food is good. If you are a visiting tourist and have no idea what to order, just let Eddie order for you. He is the coolest shop owner you will ever meet. Believe me, he loves to chat making the experience all the more worthwhile. Happy crabbing!","694":"For friends who follow my reviews, you'd know that I rarely review or recommend local eateries.It's not that I have anything against local food, it's just I so rarely find local food that impresses me enough to make me go \"wow, I need to go review this place on Yelp\".Note that this Happy Crab at Pahang Street isn't part of the \"Happy Crab\" chain that's present in other parts of the island. This place is one of a kind.First off. Grilled crabs. They're grilled till good and charred with salt and pepper. There's a real respect for the natural sweetness of fresh crab, and the combination of flavours won over someone who isn't even that big a fan of crabs. I ate an entire crab by myself. That should tell you something.We also had the best grilled squid I've ever had in Singapore. Grilled with lemon juice, and a little salt and pepper, the squid was tender and delicious. I could have polished off the whole plate by myself, but alas, I had to share.We also had deep-fried \"sand knife\" fish. I believe locally they're also called \"ikan pasir\". Now, as ridiculous as this sounds, I'm not that big a fan of seafood. But these fish. Deep fried. They were meaty, crisp, not oily or fishy in the least. I ate mine, and a third of my friend's. We also had sambal fried rice (excellent wok hei flavour, but not enough sambal), sambal kangkong (wasn't that big a fan of the sambal), and a traditional Teochew dish of cooked leeks with tau kua. The highlight of the meal was what came next. A whole parrot fish, stuffed with fresh chili, wrapped in a banana leaf, and steamed. I think I ate half the entire fish all on my own. I'm a big fan of the clean, fresh heat of chili padi, and the spiciness, combined with the firm, meaty fish was excellent. It wasn't in the least bit fishy, and I found the heat just right to provide that little tingle on the palate, while not overwhelming the flavour of the fish. All in all, I had an excellent meal, and I cannot wait to go back. I'm even bringing my mum, because she's the seafood lover in the family.","695":"It is hard to describe how good this place is. Seriously! We were standing in the taxi queue at the Marina Bay Casino and we thought about crabs. It was pouring down rain. Happy Crabs came up with 1 review. Ok, why not, let's try it. I am a 54 year old crab expert, and these crabs were insanely good!!!! The squid was also off the chart! And the rice was incredible! Perfect 10's on all items. Only complaint is the beer had to be purchased from a different operator in the same place. That was annoying, but the food more than made up for it. Also, we were visiting Singapore and I am on my way to the airport back home now. This was a totally random stop in and it was one for the records. I will never forget it and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes crabs! I cannot wait to return. MC and Eddie are great operators! Mark@funair.com","696":"Much, much, much better than the Jewel branch. We were nearby during its official launch last Friday, so of course, we have to drop by and see (out of curiosity). I was expecting a long queue but to my surprise, there wasn't! We were there around 9-ish. There were over-enthusiastic staff cheering and screaming and giving high fives as we were walking in, I thought I was there to buy an iPhone for a split second. LOL. Queueing up to order was a breeze as there were 4 counters and at least 30 staff in the kitchen churning out burgers, fries, \"concretes\" and milkshakes so efficiently. Very impressive. The wait was manageable, around 20 mins for our order. There was also staff on the dining floor assisting customers with any queries, passing them cutleries, interacting with kids and basically being a great ambassador to the brand. The dining area is big and spacious enough with lots of seating booths, tall tables, and plants. Now onto the burgers - I tried various burgers from Shake Shack before, so I decided to try Chick'nShack. Delicious chicken breast slow-cooked in buttermilk marinate and then fried to perfection served with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk mayo. Good stuff. We also tried the \"concretes\" - a term used for frozen custard blended with mix-ins. The Shack Attack is the regular cant-go-wrong chocolate mix, but my new found favorite will have to be Eye of the Tiger which is vanilla custard blend with lychee and top with lime zest. Refreshing and not too heavy on the palate. Overall, a pleasant visit and first-time experience at the new Shake Shack branch in the city.
