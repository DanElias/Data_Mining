free burritos for an afternoon with a live mariachi band playing. The line was extremely long but moved rather quickly, I got my burrito in 20 minutes.It's similar to Chipotle, fast food tex-mexy type burritos and tacos. It's okay not mindblowing, but the good part is that they're consistent. (extra star for that) It's good now that they are in a convenient location outside the central business district (CBD).3-stars. Overall consistency and that free burrito bribed me into giving another 1-star.","1":"Definitely a fan. This is my go to takeout\/delivery option as it is affordable and the portions are very generous.One of my top few mexican favourites in Singapore!","2":"Pulled pork mini burrito ($8.40) - 3 starsI really like that they offer mini burritos! Won't be getting the whole wheat tortilla the next time - the flavor just didn't quite fit in. The pork and beans were just okay. Not too dry, but the flavors could be better. The rice definitely has room for improvement - it could use better spices.","3":"I was excited with this place opened near me. I've tried them in Perth, Australia and really liked it there.Maybe it's opening pains, but it's just not the same. The ingredients aren't super fresh, and the meats were a little too salty.Those with kids beware - smoke from the nearby smokers' hangout will permeate into the al fresco dining area.","4":"Gave me the true Mexican street side experience (aka diarrhea). And yes I'm sure it was this restaurant - the rice tasted not fresh and it was the only thing I ate that night.","5":"Always a good place to grab a quick bite. My kids enjoy it too. The frozen lemonade is too sweet and I do wish they would hv a garbage can so that people can throw away their garbage. Love the biodegradable plates & cutlery.","6":"disclaimer: i am a big fan of chipotle mexican grill!the idea of having mexican food at a stone's throw away from my abode was so exhilarating! of course i have to give it a try asap and my first impression was, \"my! what a small shop front they have.\" their cashier counter was basically 3 steps away from the automatic glass door. the lady at the counter must have known it's not that easy to be staring at a steep menu board for long so she very quickly offered me the paper menu. I chose the spicy grilled steak with regular rice and a side of gucamole. she asked if i wanted sour cream. not being too keen about it, i replied, \"just a little.\" she said, \"sorry, we don't do just a little...it's additional 50 cents.\" that's when the first wave of missing Chipotle came crashing over me. i already accepted the fact I had to pay additional $2 for my guac and also they don't have corn as an ingredient in the bowl so I didn't think I want to splurge anymore for my $13 meal. Quickly i ended my order before i could do anything else stupid like ordering an additional side of churros with chocolate dip. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes and i was happy to find that they offer chipotle medium hot sauce at the condiment table; there were also sliced Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o and diced red onion plus 2 other kind of sauces. It was a good 30 minutes before i could eat and the bowl stayed pretty warm in the eco friendly to-go container. Another nice touch was the melted cheese on the rice but the real saving grace was the hot sauce I picked up on the way out. the sauce really gave the other wise regular tasting bowl its kick. if you like black beans then you will be happy to know they are very generous with their beans. i ran out of rice faster than i could eat the beans. By now i am completely missing Chipotle like crazy.Thanks Guzman and Gomez for offering me a decent bowl of mexican food. it doesn't completely satisfy me but I am glad you are in my life for now.","7":"Decent Mexican place with a variety of options. The outside seating area is prettier than the inside and the fans are enough to beat the heat. The burrito can be filling after a while so you might find it more enjoyable to have a small burrito and pair with sides like nachos. My friend opted for 2 quesadillas instead which looked rather small for a proper meal. My preference is the burrito bowl. The fish is surprisingly good- very fresh in big portions. The guacamole is also well prepared.","8":"It's ok. it's just ok. the burrito is a decent size, chock full of rice and beans, but the pulled pork was neither spicy (as advertised) nor particularly tasty. they have a nice salsa bar where you can load up on salsa and all the onions and cilantro\/coriander your heart desires.","9":"No shame. Queued for the free burrito during their opening.Beef was decent and juicy. The fish, I had lacked seasoning.However, I would recommend coming back for a hearty bite.","10":"This is nice. Close enough to to chipotle imo. So much meat stuck on my teeth. Tonight I'm a t rex.","11":"Yummy! Tried it for the first time and I must say I'm already a big fan. Had the pan seared barramundi burrito bowl with smoke chipotle sauce and extra guac. There is just so much flavour and spice in one bowl, which blended well together. Though the portion isn't huge, its enough to keep me satisfied. I'm glad that I'm able to find a similar version of Chipotle in Singapore!","12":"Food is fine.. It's Tex Mex, not hard to get it right. But the state of the property when visiting BEFORE the lunch rush at 11:53 am was an embarrassment . Floors are filthy, table tops filthy, waitresses uniform was covered with food as well. 4 thumbs down for cleanliness","13":"As a Californian from a Mexican family, I really started to miss tacos and burritos. I decided to explore every Mexican food place in Singapore(been here for over 2 months) and this is by far the best food for price. The burritos taste almost identical to Chipotle in the states, the tacos are really really good, and the quesadillas are delicious(my favorite). \u00c2\u00a0You can also get jarritos(Mexican Soda) and a pretty good guacamole. If you're from cali or want some really good tacos\/quesadillas I would definitely recommend this place. The burritos are just ok in my opinion(just like chipotle).","14":"4 stars for a mexican place in Singapore - if this place was in America, it would be 3 stars. \u00c2\u00a0It's the closest thing to Chipotle in taste, but not price. \u00c2\u00a0I love their steak burrito and steak burrito bowl. \u00c2\u00a0If you dont have the biggest appetite, definitely go for the mini burrito.","15":"I really like Guzman and regularly go here for lunch (I work across the street), but it can get pricey. My favorite order is the burrito bowl and ask them to add guac and switch out for brown rice. I would avoid the lines around noon on weekdays and pretty much any time on weekends.","16":"I paid a visit to the new branch at Star Vista, enticed by a free burrito flyer handed out at the mrt station. But when I got there shortly after 5, I was turned away by staff saying that the promo ended at 5. No end time was indicated on the flyer and the staff \u00c2\u00a0acknowledged that but still said the promo was over. Talk about false advertising! !! I told her to tell the manager that this was wrong but she casually dismissed me (the staff were having some kind of celebration and totally ignoring the customers) so I have zero confidence that she will pass my feedback. Hence I decided to post this.","17":"There's always a huge line up for Soup Nutsy during around lunch time and after passing by it who knows how many times, I finally decided to give it a try. And wow, am I nuts for Soup Nutsy! First thing you'll notice is that there are so many soup options to choose from. Options are a mix of staples that are available every day and daily specials. They are also quite accommodating for people with dietary restrictions, as they have soup options that are dairy free, vegetarian, low fat, amongst other restrictions as well. My personal favourite soup is the chunky chicken noodle... comforting and perfect for a gloomy day! Soups come in three sizes: small (12 oz), medium (16 oz) and large (20 oz). Don't be fooled by the size of the small soup because it really is more filling than you would expect!Although prices may initially seem steep for soup, you do get a well balanced meal and in comparison to the other food options in the PATH, the quality of food for the price point is really hard to beat. For just under $10 you can get a combo which comes with a small soup and two sides (options include bread, buns, apples, and bananas). Or for just a couple dollars more (around $3 more), you can get a sandwich, side salad, quinoa bowl, or fruit bowl instead of sides. They also have a bunch of snacks like cookies, oatmeal, and loaves for decent prices as well.So if you're on the fence about Soup Nutsy like I was, I highly recommend you give it a try! The line up does start growing at around 11:30 am and remains consistently busy all throughout the lunch hour so I would suggest coming early or ordering off Ritual. Worth the extra effort, I promise! Pro tip: Reuse your paper bag for 25 cents off your purchase!","18":"This is definitely the go to soup lunches in the path downtown! It's conveniently located right under the EY tower. There are many great selections of soups and various choices of sides like bread\/fruits\/veggie sticks. I had the clam chowder in medium with a banana and slice of bread for ~$11 after tax. It's definitely not your can soup stuff. The clams were tender and flavourful. There was good chunks of potatoes and celery. (1 star taken off because one large piece of potatoe wasn't diced) I went roughly at 11:40am and I cam see the crowds were on their way. Definitely recommend coming early before the line starts!","19":"The Lobster Bisque here is the Best, Jerry. The Best!The service here is much better and the people are much nicer here than in Richmond and Adelaide (people there, while not completely rude, seem quite stuck up, both times I was there).Quality: 9.5\/10. Service: 8\/10. Value: 8\/10. Overall: 9\/10","20":"Although it might easily seem that spending so much on soup isn't exactly worth it, I think Soup Nutsy might be an exception :) Every soup I've gotten here have been jam packed - they definitely don't skimp on ingredients here! The chicken noodle soup had such large chunks of chicken that I had trouble dipping my spoon in...not that I'm complaining of course. Also, their combos are a great deal since you also get a sandwich or salad - essentially 2 (or errrr 1.5) meals for the same price other places charge for 1.I do have to note that ordering here seems to be pretty disorganized. Even when I went at a time when they weren't busy, it was hard getting a server's attention and figuring out where to pick up the sides and so on. I also overheard another customer who had ordered online getting confused over her food being mixed up or something. So I wouldn't recommend coming during the lunch rush; it must be an absolute mess then. That is, more of a mess than the other messes around here...","21":"Best soup I've ever had in my life when I can get it. They sell out very early and when they are done they close up till the next day","22":"I decided to try this place our since it had some very good reviews. \u00c2\u00a0Firstly, keep in mind what their name is... Soup... so you'd think that is what their core business is... Soup. \u00c2\u00a0First time I tried this place, I made the mistake of arriving shortly after noon. \u00c2\u00a0Needless to say I was about 20-30 ppl back in the queue. \u00c2\u00a0My first thought was... well this is a good sign. \u00c2\u00a0So many ppl queued up, means it should be really good. \u00c2\u00a0I finally go to the point where I could order, I had picked up a pre-made sandwich from the cooler, and got a soup. \u00c2\u00a0I saw that they did some taste tests, but due to the number of ppl in the place, I decided not to try any, and just ordered. \u00c2\u00a0I had ordered, there were of course no spots to eat it, so I went back to the office. \u00c2\u00a0The soup was still volcano hot. \u00c2\u00a0However, it wasn't overly flavourful. \u00c2\u00a0Hmmmphf ! \u00c2\u00a0Go figure, being their core business, I would have thought it should be the best soup. \u00c2\u00a0The sandwich was good, but nothing overly fantastic either. \u00c2\u00a0I chalked it up to maybe it wasn't a good pick of a soup. \u00c2\u00a0About a month later, I decided to try it again. \u00c2\u00a0This time, I went before noon, was able to try a couple of the soups. \u00c2\u00a0Again, they were ok, but nothing fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0I had decided that I'd settle on one, and took that back to the office. \u00c2\u00a0Again, it was volcano hot, and again, it wasn't overly stellar. \u00c2\u00a0I gotta say, if your business is only soups, I would assume that you'd have something really fantastic. \u00c2\u00a0Again, I was disappointed. Overall, the price for the meal is a bit high, but I guess this is downtown Toronto. \u00c2\u00a0The soups I tried left me with a, meh, I've had better feeling. \u00c2\u00a0The sandwich was ok, but again, I'd rather pay for a freshly made sandwich instead of something that has sat in refrigeration all morning. \u00c2\u00a0I'm not feeling the love for the Soup Nutsy.... No Soup for me. \u00c2\u00a0I'm going to try other places thanks.","23":"Loving the Seinfeld references to the Soup Nazi episode! Beyond that, the first thing that surprised me was the cost! Holy cow. It was like $9.80 for one of the specials, Creole Shrimp Tomato Bisque. It does come with two \"sides\" where bread and fruit are your options. The second surprise was how gosh darn good the soup was! Holy moly. What amazing depth of flavour. The bisque was so velvety and creamy in texture without being too rich in flavour. Every spoon was as good as the last! The shrimp flavour sung brightly throughout. And the bread side was very fresh and was perfect for dipping! Gosh darn I hate the idea of paying $10 for a soup but it's hella worth it! One of the best bisques I've had!","24":"I was extremely impressed by their soup game! Came for lunch on a week day, each soup comes with 2 \"sides\" such as whole fruits or breads. The concept was weird at first - if you factor in the price, $8+ for a tiny cup of soup plus bananas & cold bread? Nonetheless, everything smelled so good, I had to give it a shot.I got a chicken pot pie soup, which came with little pie bits you can add in. The soup was PIPING HOT, I couldn't start eating it until I was done my bread. Bread was nice and fluffy and tasted nice with the soup. Soup itself was GOOD. Very rich and creamy; chunky with chicken, veggies and potatoes in every bite. It wasn't a chowder like soup, but more like you took actual chicken pot pie filling, added just a tiny bit of liquid and there's your soup! It was so indulgent and filling, I felt like I didn't need dinner that night.The price on the high end for me, especially if you're getting the meat\/seafood soups and the cup you get is a lot smaller than most places. However, you do feel comparably as full when you get a sandwich for the same value. I will definitely come back to try all their other soups!","25":"If you are in the mood for soup or chili this place is for you. They also have a fridge with freshly made healthy wraps etc. it's a great place. Remember to keep your bag they provide you for a discount on your next order. They also have a membership card towards collecting and redeeming for free soup. 4.0\/5 *","26":"This was my first time ever trying Soup Nazi but definitely not my last, i've been working in this building for two months and never found this place until today. What a great first impression! I showed up at 1 PM to ask for either the seafood bisque or the chicken gumbo as I like my food very spicy, and unfortunately both were sold out - sure enough just like the Seinfeld skit their response is \"no soup for you! \" so I ordered \u00c2\u00a0amazing beef stroganoff, and a medium which will feed me for two days was only eight dollars and came with 2 delicious fresh baked whole wheat roll. Plus when I was paying the lovely Jamaican cashier came over with a medium size gumbo that she had found in the back or something, and gave it to me for free with a wink. I think it's cute when people from spicy countries find it amusing that Caucasians like their spiciness. What an amazing deal, so now I have enough food for three days for eight dollars. Who would've ever guessed you could get a great deal financially on Bay street?","27":"I decided to get a chicken soup here today since I'm suffering from a cough. For $9 for a SMALL I expected this to be pretty damn good soup but was disappointed. It wasn't really anything special and I think I can make something better at home, maybe it wasn't the right soup to get but man that's highway robbery for a soup.","28":"Soup Nutsy offers a large variety of soups with the menu changing daily.. I believe you can check online for what soups are offered at each location.Soup Nutsy can be quite pricey if you order just a soup alone, but the combo is a good deal. For ~$9 you can get a combo size soup and a salad\/sandwich\/wrap.. which is not bad at all for lunch in the PATH. My favourite soup is the crab bisque.Remember to go early to avoid lineups and there is not much of a salad\/sandwich\/wrap selection if you come after the lunch rush. For returning customers, remember to bring your paper bag back for a $0.25 off your meal! :)","29":"I've tried Soup Nutsy twice now. \u00c2\u00a0I've had the Jamaican Crab Bisque and the Sherried Lobster Bisque. \u00c2\u00a0Both were excellent. \u00c2\u00a0The soups were full of crab and lobster and incredibly rich. \u00c2\u00a0The difference between a small and large is $9 vs. $11 so you do the math on where the value is (hint, it's the large). \u00c2\u00a0The sides are okay but they could do better here which is why I won't give it 5 stars. \u00c2\u00a0With so many soups to choose from I'll be going here for awhile now that I work in the building.","30":"I don't get it. I can't believe I spent almost $10 on soup. I visited a few weeks ago, around 11:45 AM on a weekday, and ordered the chilli, with two \"sides\" (if you could even call them that), where my total came to around $9.00, more or less. Again, on soup. Yikes.If the soup were made of gold, I'd understand the pricing. Then again, if quantity and quality matched the cost, I'd understand the pricing. But, for what it actually was, and what I actually received, I'm skeptical. The chilli was average and on the saltier side, and the two \"sides\" were: a) one small, measly piece of sliced bread, \u00c2\u00a0and b) a few chopped sticks of celery and carrots, wrapped sadly in a small piece of plastic wrap. As others have said, I don't understand the hype. With all the options there are in the PATH, I'd rather spend that $10 (or much less) on food of greater quality and quantity.","31":"Located in a food court on the path near Sheraton \u00c2\u00a0Centre. Wide variety of soups available in several sizes. They also have salads. I enjoyed the Spicy Southwest Lentil. The soup is served piping hot with your choice of two sides. Tasty and filling. A good choice for lunch. Prices are a bit high.","32":"I just paid 10$ for a tiny really salty soup and 2 pieces of stale bread. This is what a soup costs in a steakhouse like Keg.","33":"I just love to go to \"I don't know where I am going to eat\" food crawl. Soup Nutsy have so many soup choices and just thinking for to order just makes my head spin... and my Yelp Eating Friend has no choice but to line up, pick the soup, pay for it.. and screwed up the order.....Busy playing with my Yelp App.. checking in and uploading photo.. no idea what kind of soup I was eating..but really so so creamy..and wondering if my YEF wants to make me fat.. Should have come after 3 pm for Specials? Why we not doing that?? Why YEP kept mumbling that why soup so expensive? Why there's a line up? Why I picked 2 breads as a side? Why, I don't really know?!","34":"Craving soup and up for a change, I finally ventured out into the path the other day and found my way to the TD Centre where the famed Soup Nutsy was located.I was initially greeted by a long, discouraging line up that snaked outside the soup shop, inching its way towards the bank of ATM machines. My impatience was immediately assuaged as I noticed the line was moving quicker than what I initially anticipated. Inside the establishment was a fairly simple set up consisting of a counter with rows of soup cauldrons and an assembly line of staff members pouring each patron a cup of their desired size and flavor. All soups come with a fruit\/veggie bag + bread for roughly $8 (depending on what type of soup you get as meat, veggie, & seafood vary in price). They provide reusable soup nutsy bags that gives you 25 cents off on your next visit and also a loyalty card with the promise of 1 free small soup after the purchase of 10. The menu is pretty consistent offering an array of soups and a few seasonal changes and daily specials. That day I had a hankering for some crab so I ordered the Jamaican Crab Bisque. The small size soup is filling for lunch, especially since it is a thick soup. Smooth in texture, the creamy bisque was extremely flavorful with a hint of celery and spice. The chunks of crab meat in the soup were sweet and tender although scant throughout the cup. Overall, a delicious soup at a reasonable price for lunch in the PATH. I would not consider getting a \"plain soup\" (such as chicken noodle) that you can get for less than half the price at another chain restaurant in the path. This place is definitely worth a try but if you are going to spend $8 you may as well get a specialty soup.","35":"GUMBO? WHAT? DONE. FIVE STARS. YEPP. alright, y'all you can go home now. (Kidding!) I first came to know of this place after looking for places to grab soup for a sick friend of mine who lived nearby at the time. One of the best food discoveries I've ever stumbled upon, as its been four years and I still come back here when all I can think about is a big, tummy warming bowl of well flavored deliciousness and then I read what kinds of soups they have and well...*ends up teleporting over* Pros: -SO MANY CHOICES UGH BEAUTIFUL-daily specials that cater to the meat eaters, veggies and crazed cream connoisseurs-free samples! -I like how they have the 'pick two items' thing with your soups, it's nice to have a piece of fruit or soft bread afterwards (makes a good snack for later!) -after three, the soup special! Two huge soups, four sides, $15. BAM. Cons-after 3 special sometimes doesn't have everything (not a dealbreaker in my opinion) -semi-expensive otherwise, but on the same page as other edibles in the area (not a dealbreaker either) Totally worth a try if you're in the area during the non-lunch periods!","36":"I love the soup nutsy. I'm a frequent flyer and have been a happy customer for the last 5 years! I visit more frequently when I'm on the cabbage soup diet, because their miracle diet soup is basically the same thing. My only complaint can be blamed on high demand for their product... the first when they ran out of the soup I was basically served raw cabbage. The second I was served soup that was past its prime...I'm still in \u00c2\u00a0the bathroom as I write this. My only request is for discretion. If the soup is not ready, or past the best before date please don't force your locations to sell if off. Me and my co-workers will thank you.","37":"I'm a man of simple pleasures (as evidenced by my many chain restaurant reviews), but I can tell the difference between mediocrity and greatness. I would never compare Chili's and the like to top end restaurants like Alinea in Chicago. My reviews take this into account otherwise no chain would ever receive greater than 3 stars which is ridiculous. I just felt the need to explain this as I see many other reviewers don't do this. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't think that does these places justice.Anyway, food, pricing, and service; my main three attributes that pretty much determine my ratings. I thoroughly enjoyed my food. We ordered the nachos which usually can be a pile of hot mess, but each chip here was carefully prepared, plated, and topped with the same amount of cheese and toppings. Nachos always vary significantly even from one table to the next let alone different days so this was nice. They weren't the greatest since they were a bit cold and the cheese sort of hardened and not enough toppings to my liking but I like the idea.I ordered the Alex Santa Fe Burger with a veggie patty and upgraded the fries to the loaded fries minus the bacon for main. Very tasty and would highly recommend it even if you eat meat (like I do). Each dish was around $10 and we had a free kid's meal coupon that we used to take away. Less than $30 for a simple evening out with a nice snack to share later in the evening.It wasn't fancy or anything too special, but if you want to go out and be served and have a cheap meal then a place like Chili's is a place you should consider.","38":"Love chili's in general but this location is HORRIBLE. I have been ordering from this location for probably 9 months now probably once every 4-6 weeks. Every single time our order has been wrong\/ missing toppings, etc. Now, I'm THAT young millennial who will let someone cut in front of her because she can't make up her mind and\/or doesn't mind waiting 15-20 minutes for a table. So we place an order at 9:11pm. At 9:30 (like the app said) we leave to go get our food. We get there to pick it up and the woman says: \"Wanna know a secret? I accidentally gave your food to the people who just came in but yours is in and should only take another 10 minutes.\" What the hell?! I'm all for honesty but to try and joke about giving my dinner away? Not with it.So we wait. And wait. And wait. Oh and did I mention wait? 10:15, Food finally comes out, leave angrily and go home, open the box and buns are burnt & missing onions\/: Drive the extra distance to a better location. TRUST ME.","39":"I ordered a Buffalo Spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken breast was \"raw\" in the middle. Can you say Gross? I wouldn't recommend this location at all.","40":"It's your average Chili's, but the customer service here seems to be a lot better than the other Chili's. It can get a little hectic when there's a lot of people though... we had to wait about ten minutes for our check and a box.","41":"We stopped here for a quick lunch before we checked into our hotel. We were sat promptly when we arrived. We always wash the the table down before my son sits down as he has a shell fish allergy. The table had one of the ordering station and game centres. I was a little shocked at how dirty these things are! This is why they didn't get a 5 star  \u00c2\u00a0I had the boss! Great sloppy burger juicy AF!! The boneless wings were good also, the plate was allot larger than it needed to be. Made my son feel like there's something missing...  All and all it was a good lunch! Only recommendation would be to clean the tablets at each of the tables.","42":"I may be a chain snob, but Chili's is one of my guilty pleasures. Friday's and Applebees have never compared. Right now my favorite is a burger with cheddar, avocado, honey chipotle sauce, and jalapeno aioli. Messy, but so good.I'm also partial to fries with their inimitable honey mustard.They have a sandwich similar to the grilled chicken and avocado club at the Cheesecake Factory, but I haven't tried it yet to see how it compares.We get consistently excellent service at this location, and my burger is always cooked medium rare as ordered.They have a monthly $5 specialty margarita, but I especially love the blue margarita because it makes me think of the ocean.","43":"I drove all the way from toronto to new York to have Chili's! Specifically their Texas chili cheese fries! Yummm!!","44":"IF you LOVE: Chipped glass, COLD food, remade food with hair THIS is the location for YOU!! \u00c2\u00a0Felt bad for our waitress that had to deal with these issues from the bartender and kitchen until she decided it was better to seat new customers before getting me a fork so I could enjoy my 2nd try at hot food. The ONLY 2 things that made our meal ok was the warm chips and salsa the waitress brought while we again waited and hoped for hot food and the manager took off the price of the chicken tacos sprinkled with hair, plus half off my \"spicy\" \u00c2\u00a0shrimp tacos and gave my daughter a piece of cheesecake to take home in a bag tipped sideways as he handed it to her. I had said I would never go back to Chili's three and a half years ago when I was served cold food twice, but at a different location. The only reason we went is because I had a balance on a gift card from that previous visit 3 years ago. Needless to say, we will NEVER set foot in a Chili's again. We will spend our hard earned money at delicious LOCAL restaurants that care about their customers and serve HOT food and intact dishes with amazing service!!","45":"This place is terrible been here a couple times now hoping that my other bad experiences would be fixed, by finally a good one. But no that's not the case. Today will be my last time ever eating here. Their cups and silverware are barely clean, my girlfriend's cup had specs of food in it \u00c2\u00a0thank god she got water so she could see it so they couldn't of covered it up with pepsi or a darker beverage. This place is - excuse my language ass. Service so slow","46":"We just had our first experience ordering from Chili's on Military Road in Niagara Falls using the DoorDash app. While DoorDash seemed to be an excellent service the meal from Chili's was absolutely the worst meal I've had in a long time. My Boneless Chicken Wings were more like eating Boneless Rocks from my driveway. The Queso was,, well I'm not sure what it was. I posted a picture with this review showing the Queso I received and a picture from their website showing the Queso I should have received. I also posted a picture of the Boneless Wings they sent that were not only burnt but hard as a rock and as cold as a winters night. And add to all of this everything was cold. DoorDash evidently follows up with its customers to see if you were happy not only with their service but the food itself. I complain that the meal was terrible so terrible we tossed it in the trash. To DoorDash's credit they immediately issued me a 20 dollar credit but it should be Chili's making it right. Anyways that being said \u00c2\u00a0Chili's on Military Rd in Niagara Falls needs to do a much better job so trash like our meal doesn't leave their restaurant.","47":"Food was good but was not impressed with the waitress. She started out strong but then we barely saw her and had to get up ask the hostess 3 times for help. I pointed to the $5 Marg special and asked what flavors it came in. I was charged $8.29 on my bill and when I inquired she responded with it must have been a misunderstanding and immediately turned around and walked away. Not impressed. We also got charged for a side of fries, that showed up on our table, but no one ordered them or could eat them. The other couple we were with gave their CC to pay their bill, and when she brought the receipt back to sign, the bill was $7 more. It was a long day and already late and since we got the shaft on our first question, we left. Service leaves an impression as much as food","48":"Not only is this the worst Chili's I've ever been to, it's \u00c2\u00a0most likely the worst restaurant I've been to. \u00c2\u00a0Ever. I blame myself, partly because I keep going back and giving them my money despite both the food and service being terrible. \u00c2\u00a0In fairness to the staff, the three occasions all occurred at the bar, ordering take out. \u00c2\u00a0My latest visit will be my last though. \u00c2\u00a0The bartender was too preoccupied talking with her friend at the end of the bar to take my drink order. When I finally got my drink, the glass was only about 3\/4 of the way full. \u00c2\u00a0Whatever, I just wanted some takeout and assumed since there were only three other people at the bar and two other tables in the bar area and they were all eating that my 3\/4 of a beer would be plenty to hold me over until my food was ready. I was wrong. \u00c2\u00a0Almost 45 minutes for chicken tenders and nothing else. \u00c2\u00a0Needless to say, that beer lasted only about 25 minutes and I sat with an empty glass in front of me while the bartender conversed some more with her buddy at the end of the bar, a server or two , and some \u00c2\u00a0red haired fellow I assumed was the manager. \u00c2\u00a0The real disappointment here is that I've been to Chili's all over the country and they're typically well run. \u00c2\u00a0I'm also a little disappointed in myself for returning here after several bad experiences. \u00c2\u00a0Corporate really needs to take a look at this location.","49":"It's really to bad, this used to be a nice clean place, now it's so dirty we were afraid to eat there and had to drive to Lewiston to eat when we were really to tired. Its the same old thing, young kids working there, unsupervised, no standards or work ethics! No common sense. And the kicker was, they were not even busy. They won't be in business long! Lol Guess the Chili's guest engagement team can't read or understand English either? They want me to call them and explain it slower? Clean the place up, its dirty, sticky, floor is dirty, doors are dirty, etc.","50":"We came to watch the Saints game and eat some apps. The food is fine, I mean, it's a Chili's. But... It's dead in here and somehow the service is crazy slow- our waitress just keeps sitting on her ass at the bar, fiddling with her phone. Meanwhile, we've been waiting 10 minutes for a refill on water and a second beer. We've been watching her... sitting there on her phone... not getting our drink orders in.... My husband had to go to the bar to get service. Absolutely unacceptable.","51":"Always passed by this resto when I cross the border to go to the outlets to shop but I never had a chance to try it. Finally did! We came on a Sunday for brunch and it wasn't that busy. We got seated quickly in a booth in the bar area. I really liked the tiles they used for the table, it looked nice. Since it was our first time there it took us forever to decide what we wanted to order. On Sundays they had a $5 special which was 11 pieces of boneless chicken bites or 6-7 wings. It was pretty cheap so we got 2 servings of that with honey chipotle sauce. They used chicken breast for the pieces and the batter was made perfectly for these boneless bites. The honey chipotle sauce was really good too. A little sweet, little sour with a slight hint of spice. I originally wanted a burger but I still wasn't too hungry and wouldn't be able to finish so I got the 3 split appetizer to try which was about the same price as a burger. Of the 3, I got chicken crispers, Mexican spring rolls and burger sliders. The chicken crisper tastes like the boneless bites except chicken tender format. Burger sliders, like your normal burger but smaller. Mexican spring rolls had beans and salsa in it. I actually liked this the most. Was something unusual and new for us and it was flavourful. There were 3 dipping sauces (idk what they were and what you were supposed to dip what with) so I mixed and matched everything. All good! My boyfriend got the fajita mix which was a sizzling plate with veggies, rice, beans, steak slices, chicken slices, and shrimp along with the fajita sides and salsa. That dish was HUGE and he couldn't finish it. As for service, it's a little slow but we had a lot of time that day that we didn't mind. There's so many other things that I wanna try and I would def come back as it's really close to the border from Canada!","52":"My first time ever to a Chili's with my mother and boyfriend as a lunch date I expected some great food and customer service since I been recommended here a few times. Upon arriving I only waited less than 10 minutes which was a plus but was seated very close to the door \u00c2\u00a0but not a big issue. Took our waiter about 15 minutes to actually come take our drink orders and he was friendly and nice. Now this is where it got bad, we ordered our food specifically \u00c2\u00a0not wanting bacon on the sliders and white queso dip. Got the appetizer and it was cheddar queso dip and I let that slide because it was still decent. \u00c2\u00a0Ordering our entree was no hassle yet we had to wave down our waiter everytime we needed a refill on drinks it's like he didn't care to check on us not once and even after getting our dinners he was at other tables and NOT ONCE asked us if our food was okay or anything. Watching other waitresses and waiters attending their tables better than ours was just aggravating. I just wish I had a better customer service experience for my first time because I surely won't be back! Food was good but not worth the poor service!","53":"My daughter and I come here often. We really enjoy dessert which is fabulous as always. It would be nice if their French fry portion was comparable to the picture. Besides that the food is really good.","54":"Went to the outlets and this was nearby so we stopped in for lunch. Got seated right away near a booth by the bar, the server was friendly and quick. Got our food which didn't take long and was good. Overall very good experience will probably be dropping in every time we go the outlets.","55":"I placed an Order of the Bone-in Wings 2 $20.78Buffalo - On SideRanch Dressing - RemoveBleu Cheese DressingThe Boss Burger* 1$14.69No PinkMayonnaiseJalapeno Cheddar Smoked Sausage - RemoveMushroom Swiss Burger*1$11.19No PinkChiliBUT I guess because it was to go no one really cared my boss burger was really pink and my husbands had no flavor he said it was very bland. This is a go into only DO NOT I repeat DO NOT ORDER OFF LINE.","56":"We left Applebees due to NO service to go here. \u00c2\u00a0Our waitress was amazing! \u00c2\u00a0She made our experience 100% and we had great food! I would recommend them 100%","57":"This review is long overdue. Wanted to rave about one of my favourite places in Orchard Road, but just didn't get to do it till now (excuses I know hahahahah). So, here's the story. Celebrated my birthday at this cafe in May this year with my gal friends. 4 of us ordered a few mains and a dessert to share. I gotta say we were all very happy with the food. I especially love the 2 main dishes: Fuwa Fuwa Hoshino Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Porcini Rissoto Tomato Cream and Omu Rice with Shrimp & Mozarella. Just writing about them and looking at their yelp pictures are making me hungry now. Their dessert item, Double Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 Style is also recommended. It is so big I am sure it can feed 8 instead of the 4 of us. Love the service here! Definitely one of the few places in SG where you can enjoy good and cheery service at a mid-priced eatery. Good service is just super hard to find in SG #sadfactoflife.I have been coming to this cafe chain over the years. My favourite outlet is still this Plaza Singapura one. After writing this review, I have the urge to visit it soon. Think I gotta make it real soon. #whydoeswritingreviewsmakeonehungry?","58":"Came here for the coffee on a weekday afternoon with my friend. The coffee was pretty decent, I really enjoyed my iced coffee float :DThe ambience is pretty nice for a late afternoon chill time since the place is not too crowded. The service is decent and they provide baskets to put your bag in.Would love to come back again for a proper meal!","59":"Stopped by for a quick coffee break at Hoshino Coffee as it was close by and we were too lazy to go around hunting elsewhere. There was no queue so we were able to grab a seat quick!Hoshino Coffee is an open air cafe in the middle of Plaza Singapura (or Plaza Sing, for short). We were seated and greeted quickly by our host & waitress. The booths were nice to sit in, was comfy and soft.There is a button at the side of the table, allowing you to call the waitress - which is similar to some Korean restaurants here in Toronto. I find this method extremely effective because I don't have to waste time flagging down a server.We ordered the Hoshino Coffee as it seemed to be the special food item which was \"roasted over open fire, gives a strong boiled flavour with pleasant sourness\". Coffee was alright to me, but it was really rich - kind of reminds me of the French Roast from Starbucks.I wanted the Matcha latte but decided not to get it after looking at the price. $9 for either hot or iced matcha latte is pure daylight robbery to me!! Unless it was going to be served in a big cup... which I highly doubt. Hoshino Coffee, served with a tiny bit of milkWe also got the pancake souffle style with strawberry, which was on their spring recommendations page. The presentation was super cute as strawberries have this special talent of adding an oomf to every dish! With syrup drizzled on the outer edges and strawberry jam drizzled on top, with ice cream on the side... it looked really appetizing.Unfortunately, I feel like it isn't that special for the price. The pancake souffle just tastes like a really thick version of a pancake... nothing special. I personally felt that the ice cream was a tad small. The strawberries tasted fresh and sweet.IAlso to mention that I rarely saw waiters\/waitresses walking around after ordering... Barely any of them walked about and only seen when they're bringing out food or drinks. Had to call the waitress using the button just to get my water refilled... which was an odd feeling to me.All in all, it was just okay at Hoshino Coffee. I feel like it's a tad expensive for what they offer because I don't find anything unique about the place for that pricing.","60":"1 star each for the 5 things that make it for me. (Service, cleanliness, food, price and \"will I come back?\"). This place hits all five. FIVE STARS!Service was good, attentive and non-intrusive. I asked about the iced-coffee and the server was able to explain everything AND accommodate my special request. No fuss!The restaurant was clean and well-kept. The menu was small, but had pictures for most, so can't go wrong there. Gordon Ramsey will have a fit, I'm sure. \"NO PHOTOS IN YOUR MENU, ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING?\" he'd yell. But me, I like to see a preview of what I'm ordering. By the way, since this is a Japanese coffee shop, there is a huge display of waxed facsimiles of most of the food available for you to ooh and ahh over.Souffles! Savoury and sweet souffles! Pancakes of incredible thickness, but fluffy and light like a... souffle! Each pancake is almost 2 inches thick! The french toast was also very good. I had a savoury souffle, and even though it was topped with a huge souffle, the dish was not heavy at all.Price was slightly high for some items, but reasonable for others. The coffee items have a refill option of $3 or so. Will I come back? Yes, please!","61":"I passed by this cafe many times and it was only until yesterday I finally get my first taste with a fellow yelper. The wait (20 minutes) was killing me but it was certainly worth it. Because my friend told me she probably won't be able to finish her portion, so we decided to share and trust me the mouthfuls of pancake I had (Chocolate Banana) wasn't enough to satisfy my stomach. I was tempted to order another one but eventually I didn't since the sweet mango drink I had was enough for my tummy for that evening and that's how good it was. I didn't understand why the wait was so long but I glad I waited, it's one of the better places for pancakes. Soft and tasty is what I \u00c2\u00a0remember from my few bites. Another thing is both of us seemed to be competing with one another to see who gets more bites of it. I ate it so quickly that I forget the primary rule of eating, that is to enjoy it slowly. I will order my own share the next time I come back. Good food means the staff will see more of me!! *evil grin* The mango smoothie was nice, not too sweet like some other places and it went well with the cake. Overall, this is in my list of recommendation especially coming from a big fan of the Land of the Rising Sun!","62":"Located on the third floor extension of Plaza Singapura, is Hoshino Coffee, a popular Japanese chain of coffee shop. I wanted to try this so badly at Shibuya but time did not allow. So back here in Singapore, I decided to go all out and try it!! 7 souffl\u00c3\u00a9s ordered and here goes my personal souffl\u00c3\u00a9 buffet!! \"Gotta catch em all!\"Now that is supposedly Spring in Japan, even though my Japanese friends told me it snowed last week and it's currently 6 degrees celsius in Tokyo, the Spring menu for Hoshino coffee includes this super pretty pink \u00c2\u00a0strawberry souffl\u00c3\u00a9 pancake!1. Hoshino's Spring Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 $14.50++So after the waitress took our 7 orders of souffl\u00c3\u00a9s, all the 4 pancakes arrived at all table all at once! The strawberry ice cream was very smooth, it wasn't too sweet but the syrup they provided us was very sweet indeed! Use it sparingly over the souffl\u00c3\u00a9, as it can drown out your taste buds and we had 6 more souffl\u00c3\u00a9s to try and we didn't want to kill our taste buds. The souffl\u00c3\u00a9 itself is alot harder than the normally fluffly souffl\u00c3\u00a9. As it is a pancake, I would consider it more like a fluffier and slightly tougher version of a chiffon cake.2. Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Chocolate Banana $13.50++Lots of chocolate sauce going on here. When you order a pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9, you have an option of whipped cream of softee. We went with softee for all our pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9s and we liked the softee. Japanese soft serves, you can never go wrong with them! The pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9 don't have any fillings inside, unlike the hot vanilla souffl\u00c3\u00a9s.3. Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Mango $13.50++We decided to go easy on the syrup for this one, having tried the first Spring souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with syrup and the second one with alot of chocolate sauce. The softee itself isn't very sweet, as such you can taste the subtle sweetness of the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 pancake!4. Pancake Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Matcha \"Ogura\" Bean Paste $13.50++The most modest of the pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9s, and my personal favourite. The matcha soft cream here tastes very similar to the one I tried at Tsujiri, it has a stronger bitter after taste than the typical sweet and sugar-ladden matcha ice cream. The bean paste is also very sweet, as such, be careful not to get a sugar-overdose trying to eat that on it's own! 5. Vanilla Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with Chocolate\/Custard\/Matcha sauce $10.80++ eachAll the vanilla souffl\u00c3\u00a9s arrived at our table just as we were done with the pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9!You gotta pour the sauces into the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 and the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 was steaming hot as we sliced it open, and even as we dug in, each spoonful, you could still see it steaming!! It is a very hot dessert, and be careful not to burn your tongue!Of the 3 sauces, my favourite was custard. It had the right amount of sweetness! The chocolate was abit too sweet for my liking and the green tea wasn't sweet at all!and here's the bill for our exploration of 7 souffl\u00c3\u00a9s at Hoshino coffee!!Service is pretty good here, there's a button for your to press and the waitress will come to you. The also provide you with a bag to put your things.","63":"The initial wait was reasonable. Around 15 mins. Waiting for the food was abit slower. Service was kinda average. They had service bell on the table but they were kinda useless. It is much faster raising your hands and getting service. The service staff serving our table had limited knowledge of English so asking her questions like 'do you sell the coffee beans' needed another staff to help. Food wise it was a hit and miss. I had the demi-glac\u00c3\u00a9 omu rice. The sauce was decent but the proportion of the rice to the sauce was inbalanced. I think they should give more sauce or reduce the size of the dish. The dessert was a letdown. I had the creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e. The dessert was not made on the spot since the crust sugar was cold on taste. Price wise I find it a tad expensive.","64":"Very disappointing... the pancake was dry and the egg omelette is nothing special.. sakura and matcha latte was bland and too milky.. not much flavor..","65":"Curious about the line so did what typical Singaporean do - Q. \u00c2\u00a0We got the choc ganache pancake souffle and we thought it was good. \u00c2\u00a0The pancake is fluffy and soft which is very typical of japanese bakery. The ganache though was not that smooth but overall it turns out ok. \u00c2\u00a0Sadly the coffees are not that great. \u00c2\u00a0Not sure about the food so won't comment.","66":"Great! Loved my matcha latte. Most places do it too milky and too sweet, I like mine with more matcha taste and this place is perfect.The souffl\u00c3\u00a9 were great. While not the fluffiest and lightest that I gave tasted, it is still really yummy. I tried both the matcha and pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9.As we were leaving, the dinner crowd started and we saw many orders of the blank squid ink pasta. Guess I know what to order on my next visit!","67":"The Food1. Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle ($15.80) \u00c2\u00a0- My favorite! I tried this based on Angeline C's recommendation and she was right on spot. This was definitely a unique dish. It has an amazing, light scrambled-eggs-buttery flavor. My only complain would be there was too little meat in it (barely half a dozen small sausage cubes). 2. Omelette rice with beef sauce - Average. 3. Matcha souffle with softie ice-cream - I love the souffle but it was a bit wet towards the end when I got to the bottom of the bowl. Also, I would have preferred a stronger match flavor. The softie ice-cream was all melted and running when they served it which was a let down. 4. Pancake souffle - It tasted more like a sponge cake than a souffle but it was still worth a try. Interesting concept for a pancake. 5. Hoshino Pot Baked Curry Rice - served with eggs (a little more undercooked than the typical sunny-side up style), sausage and some brocoli. Good. I like the way the egg was wet & runny :) They were more generous with the sausage helpings in this dish too. I think I saw a full sausage. Overall, an interesting japanese fusion restaurant. I like the creative concepts of mixing up dishes like the pancake-souffle and the \u00c2\u00a0Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle (which was like a savory souffle crossed with baked rice). I don't think I've tried this anywhere else so definitely worth a check out :) The queue gets pretty crazy at dinner time. Best to come \u00c2\u00a0before the dinner crowd (6.30pm should be safe).","68":"It's at least a 15 minute wait for a seat. And go with a person if you really want to try it. If you're alone, they prolly make you wait till there's a single table available even if there's a booth empty. Apparently the barista got me a booth and got himself a scolding from the waitress (aunties; can't expect must from them)The service I must say is freaking lousy. The bell works perfectly fine, but they just don't come. Too busy I guess? But so many of them were talking amongst themselves without paying attention. Or should there be a better system to serve the customers?I hope the food would at least wow me so I may not give a negative feedback about this place.People watching is fun here though. Because it's crowded, the patrons do not suspect you staring at them. I do love the secrecy of this. And they kind of just release who they are from inside. If you're sitting at a booth, you can even watch people in other restaurants from other levels having food and what not.Food wise. Well done. I loved it a lot. The cream sauce in the carbonara dish wasn't that thick that would stick to your tongue and even if it does after a few mouths, drinking a small sip of water would clear it up mostly.","69":"-casual, open air cafe in atrium setting, get a booth seating-hand dripped coffee is headlined, so one has to try. Happy to say it is a lovely, concentrated cup of coffee with a rich, full bodied roast. I'm a fan of the taste of coffee, I just don't want to consume a whole soup bowl's worth. -lots of small, subtle touches that make the dining experience very enjoyable and, dare I say, Japanese. Ex. Baskets provided for your handbag, individual minijugs of cream and sugar syrup-rare instance that I don't see often enough in Singapore; all the dishes arrived together, so we all eat at the same time. Why can't more places do this?-shrimp, avocado and egg sandwich. Onions hidden inside which gives the sandwich a nice, subtle kick. The shrimp were nice and juicy. Great snack to have with coffee-enjoyed the experience so much so, we extended the coffee into lunch and ordered pasta (spaghetti w\/ eggplant, bacon, shimeji & sausage; carbonara w\/ yolk & bacon) and rice (Demi glace 'Omu' rice w\/ mozzarella)-well prepared Japanese style pasta, that is scrumptious. -the western styled omelette rice was ok. You have to appreciate ketchup. Not that it was overwhelming, but it was very much there in every bite. The light, fluffy egg and half glaze couldn't balance out the tomato sweetness. -overall a delightful experience, can't wait to come back and try other dishes","70":"The curry rice is definitely better than the fuwa-fuwa. Souffl\u00c3\u00a9 is nice. I can't really tell if the coffee is good. I'm an espresso drinker. It's a nice place. Like it. 10% service fee but hey, why I have to get up to pay for the bill ? Haha stupid","71":"The coffee is really good. No doubt.However, after waiting for 15mins to get in (when there were several empty tables), I was told they don't have thick pancake, so I ordered souffl\u00c3\u00a9 instead. Guess how long I waited? More than 50 minutes! For the freaking souffl\u00c3\u00a9!! Unbelievable!!!","72":"Desert quite yucky. The pasta is ok and the coffee is normal, but sell at Starbucks pricing.","73":"This place is odd. It is like they are trying to create a quaint Japanese-style Western ambiance like Maison but in the middle of an open floor of a mall, so it seems out of place.$6 for the coffee is steep. The matcha green tea latte with ice cream was good, but there wasn't much ice cream because it was resting on big cubes of ice which went almost to the top of the cup. I would ask for it with no ice if I go back. These drinks were decent but in my opinion it would not have been worth waiting in the nearly omnipresent queue for them.","74":"You know it's Japanese - the waiters all dressed up spiffily in that old-school 'western' vest suit ensemble, woody earthy paneling... I didn't have coffee but ordered the chocolate lava cake which was quite diving, warm and oozy and went well with the soft vanilla ice cream. Tried some of the green tea souffle as well which I enjoyed surprisingly - not a big fan of green tea but this one was not overly-teaish in taste and the souffle was of a good texture.","75":"Hoshino Coffee's casual vibe, trendy fare and wallet-friendly price points have made it a hit among the teenybopper set and the broke-by-the-end-of-the-month types.I suggest getting the eggy souffle baked rice and although the menu alleges this as \"rissoto\", it is really a term used loosely, and more regular Japanese rice than Italian risotto:1) Omu Souffle ($16.80): tomato rice casserole dotted with broccoli and shrimp.2) Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle ($15.80): with mushrooms and ham bits 3) Matcha Souffle ($10.80): semi-collapsed by the time it got to our table. This was disappointing, and I much rather spent a few dollars more and get the fabulous ones at Laurent Bernard.4) Ice Matcha Latte with Softee ($9.30): rich and robust. Much better than the souffle as a sweet finisher","76":"Seriously good! U wouldn't believe that the queue speaks for itself. I'd thought, well, it could be that people are simply curious about what this 2 week's old is capable of. And when the line starts to form, more people just keep queuing without a single complain. It was a late lunch thingy after a movie show, I make my way to this little cafe joint speedily. This is like crazy, the snaking line - almost a L-shaped by now is still around. I have seen the same this morning at 11.10m (the outlet only open at 11.30am!) when I drop by to ask if I could make a reservation for 3pm but was turned down politely, which now I clearly understand why. I know this is what I have to eat despite still nursing my throat discomfort & joined the queue - determined to know if they are as good as they claimed.The interior is not entirely small but having a 3 separate dining space. The main hall sits most of the diners with wooden table and leather padded seats. It emits a brighter and casual feel, probably the area is not constraint by a stiff ceiling but an architectural glass rooftop in the mall that illuminates the stretch with a natural glow of sunlight. There are 4 booth seats which is most ideal for a gals-get-together session, I figured. The menu was straight forward, without fanciful hard to understand dishes. Zoom right into my orders and wave for the staff, the lady clad in chef suit came to me (gosh, even one works in the kitchen has to take time to manage the hall during peak hours?).. aw.. but she was very well-mannered and patient when confronted with inquiries. In fact, no one was seen idling - all the wait person served with pride, promptly and in an unhurried manner. A remarkable service team.I admit I felt a little uneasy when I picked that unfamiliar dish - Fuwa Fuwa. But the truth tells me that feeling has been unwarranted.The most raved about \u00c2\u00a0\"fluffy savory souffl\u00c3\u00a9\" seriously did not put to shame. Not only that it enticed me with its huge golden puffy bonnet but I was completely sold by its astonishing delicate flavors \u00c2\u00a0This is one dish I wish I had on my last - cottony & airy, formidable without a trace of deflating. It is no wonder that people called it the \"cloud\", but I think it's me that's on Cloud 9 at every bite. Instead of baking it like an Italian classic with white sauce, this one has a tomato version in it. It was filled with incredible moments - spooning the whites like a mass destruction into that light feathery foam, trespassing to get to the bed of the baking dish. The gems hidden under these soft foams have never been so right. Tomato sauce infused - each grain was plump, tangy-sweet, not soggy. Its flavor was enhanced by strips of middle eye bacon and mushroom bits. Together with that eggy, Parmesan cheese souffl\u00c3\u00a9, a divine marriage left unchallenged by the sweet version. Impossible not to eat, I think I can have 1 on every other day. A couple of spaghetti dishes if you like, other than \"Omu\" rice (omelette rice) or sandwiches. I had the Lobster Bisque Soup Spaghetti. A french dish but cooked the Japanese way for a lighter taste. Instead of highly seasoned, this one prepared with tomato and finely chopped mushrooms comes with a milder liquidized cream but rich crustaceans flavor. I find the soup a little offensive (even while its still steaming hot) while my dining partner finds it delicious, so I guess it's a mixed conclusion. It was not entirely bad - at least the spaghetti is cooked the correct way, I guess I just didn't have the mood for such a sophisticated seafood thing today.String along with others, I ordered a pancake souffl\u00c3\u00a9, this time a more familiar sweet version! Not the plain ones but a more elaborate classic with a tropical touch. I have been advised to remind the kitchen to start preparing the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 when I was half way into my main course. It was like taking a number queue to a souffl\u00c3\u00a9! I was asked to wait for another 15mins by the apologetic service staff. Not an issue at all, I said to myself because the end result was a light and airy inflated sponge that was unforgettable. The only negative I had was the fruits. Upon checking, I learnt that frozen mango fruits are used while the kiwi are fresh produces. I'd prefer ripened fruits atop my dessert, not raw and crunchy. Worst, the mango has a weird over-frozen texture makes them taste rubbery. However, the homemade whipped cream was smooth. And pls do not leave the place without a cup of Hoshino blend.Whaff that strong Hoshino caffeine scent right in front of me - that was one of the distinct characteristic while waiting in line. Carefully selected coffee beans were roasted over direct flame and then hand drip to a good-bodied brew. The blend has got a rather pale flavor \u00c2\u00a0less rich as compared to Oriole's. Milder acidity but has a lingering smell. I guess the Japanese adores this light perfumery beverage. I am good for that 10g but if anyone wanted an extra brew, there is a 50% off for a refill.","77":"While the seating isn't the greatest, the coffee is outstanding and the food is delicious. Grab a table and place your order at the counter when you're ready. Eggs & toast was SG$10 which seemed reasonable (for the area). The avocado toast was an absolute mountain of avocado!I really loved my latte (for the first time in Singapore) - finally one that wasn't overly bitter. Melbourne folks continue to meet the stereotype of being coffee experts. We also had a vanilla-Nutella milkshake. I was a little surprised that it was watery like milk (instead of thick like american shakes) but it was still super tasty!Free wifi - just ask for the code.","78":"Cute little cafe hidden away in bouna vista's industrial area. Chill ambiance and a quite little book corner gives you the perfect chill. Yummy pork hash and great all day breakfast!!","79":"Walked in greeted and felt welcome. Menu changed a little from some of the postings. \u00c2\u00a0The eggs were great and service was fast. \u00c2\u00a0 I wish I had know about this place the food so much better than the hotel","80":"If you're after some Melbourne style coffee and food, then this is the place for you. It can get fairly busy during lunch time on the weekends though.","81":"Located at the ground of a block of private housing is this tiny cafe. The dine in area was limited. Menu was a simple clip board, some sliced cakes on the display shelf. Although it was air-con indoor, we could barely feel the air-con, so we did try to adjust the standing fan next to us.MochaThe drink was quite rich and thick, but not enough coffee taste.Carrot cakeQuite a huge silce but I would prefer it to be more moist.Dom Pedro ($18)Fresh Milk, Vanilla Ice-Cream + Black Nikka WhiskyIt looked just like another plain vanilla milkshake. In just a single taste, I could feel the heat of the alcohol down my throat. Feeling high fast. It was rather strong drink to have.Overall the drinks were great. But in the warm dine in area, one tended to feel sleepy easily.","82":"I've been here a few times since I discovered Jimmy Monkey. Each time for breakfast on the weekend. Grab a menu and order at the counter, then the wait staff will bring out the food. The coffee is excellent, and I love the vibe of the place. The staff is friendly and attentive. Yes, the food is a little price-y, but not too far out of range for this kind of place. My favorite so far is the hash. Just a little bit of spice and just satisfying enough for brunch.","83":"A quaint place with a really interesting design.Perfect for a catch-up with buddies over a cup of coffee instead of hustling in town.There were books in the bathroom and a rubix cube too. HAHA","84":"Cool, little nook with compact seating, 9 tables and 2 benches. Industrial, 3 levels exposed which must be helping to absorb all the sound. A plus in my book compared to other places that look \u00c3\u00bcber cool, but once seated is a cacophony, reveberated in a too enclosed space. Becomes quite a hub of activity on a sunday morning. A mix of residences nearby, young families, partners for brunch. If u need only the caffeine fix, JM Too is across the pathway and have the new Slayers.\u00c2\u00a0On to the food. Simple menu, doesn't offer everything under the Suns. The small things make a difference. Like mesclun salad over iceberg lettuce, ripe avacados, fresh ciabatta. Price point are on the higher side, but I'm finding that across the island these days. Portions are ample and generous. Quality and freshness on the ingredients. You don't get a 'that's it!?' reaction when the plate is served.\u00c2\u00a0And lastly the coffee never misses. Very much recommended.","85":"Jimmy Monkey came highly recommended for its coffee and that was the main reason behind my visit to this off location. The space sort of screams hipster in name, design and look of the staff. That is not necessarily a bad thing as it often can deliver some good food and beverages.The coffee was pretty good and clearly better than any random place but still not really impressive wither. If it would have been around the corner I could have visited again but not at all worth traveling this far for. Also had a decent brekkie muffin and a pasta with mushrooms. Not bad but also a bit overpriced.What was however a pleasant surprise was that the staff were friendly and helpful. Service was also smooth and fast despite the place being packed.","86":"Great coffee and good quality food. Deducting one star for the location \u00c2\u00a0(quite a walk from the nearest mrt station) and one star for the price (you leave wondering if you really got what you paid for). Definitely not a place you'll pass by unless you make an intentional effort to visit it. May or may not come back","87":"At this point, I'm no longer shocked by prices in this part of town. Anywhere in one north is almost exclusively catering for ex-pats and high-income locals. Jimmy Monkey is no different. Egg's Benedict will run you a whopping $24, pancakes are $14, and the french toast is $17.They had run out of pancakes on a Sunday at noon so I went with the french toast, and added on a chocolate, peanut butter, speculoos shake for good measure. This was not a wallet-friendly brunch but I was happily surprised by how tasty everything was. The french toast comes in a healthy serving, and includes berries and cr\u00c3\u00a8me fra\u00c3\u00aeche. By the end I was actually struggling to finish my serving because everything was so sweet.I wouldn't be opposed to returning but this place is definitely a treat, and not a joint for regular meals. Seating is fairly limited, but somehow sufficient for the number of patrons. It gets a little warm, and the space does feel a little cramped. Nonetheless there are a variety of seating options depending on what you're up to.","88":"I googled for free-wifi AND power plugs and found this place. What's lovely about it is you can manage to comfortably get lounge seats on a weekend evening. And there's no queue, not much of a crowd throughout the night. Yes, it's QUIET. A rare gem I would say.I also really admire the fact I could drink coffee, look up and there you are, a TOILET BOWL complete with toilet paper right above my head. It's so randomly ridiculous yet genius that I LURVE IT. I even took a picture of it, go see.I ordered the banana bread pudding, - $14, and coffee. The presentation of the bread pudding was very cute, it came in a pot, on a wooden slab. Coffee was better than most cafes I've been to, and service was... Let's just say that they let you do your own thing, and they do theirs, and if both lines should intersect, colourful unicorns will bloom. Pricing is on the high side.One thing that made me feel like getting up to leave, was the glaring red neon lighting fixture, that engulfed me and my companion. It reminded me of an episode in Seinfeld (who else still watches this?!) where Kramer's entire room emitted a red glow because Kenny Rogers moved opposite his room and their crazy signboard faced his window.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.","89":"I'll just get this out of the way first. I'm probably one of five people in the world that doesn't drink coffee. I know how to grind beans and make coffee in a french press for my mum, I love the smell of coffee brewing and when it pops up in savory food and sweets...but I just hate the taste of coffee as a drink. No matter how much milk, sugar, nothing, best beans, kona beans, any beans, my man has tried to get me to drink it and the most I've tolerated is 2 sips. The one time I drank a caramel latte in Japan because I totally misread the menu, it was really sweet and suddenly I was talking non-stop for an hour. Since this IS a coffee joint, my dude has his two cents in this review. He had a decaf black and in his words \"it's wonderful. very smooth\". So there.Now on to the food. We're really brunch people so we were looking for food more than coffee. When I say I'm a brunch person it's not because I like to dress up to eat a meal I can cook at home. I'm actually a hungry person, I like brunch foods and someone always wakes up too late to fire up the pan. Anyway, we had the french toast and a breakfast sandwich (can't remember the exact name) and both were pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0My french toast was made of 3 thick slices of brioche sliced up, drizzled with a caramel sauce with bananas and nuts drizzled over. It was beautiful to see and a hearty portion for my rumbling tummy. Here's the problem: the egg wash wasn't soaked through the bread. Whhhhhhhhy? It would've been perfect otherwise. If there's a monkey jimmy listening - please soak the toast, turn the heat low and cook that baby.The breakfast sandwich was a standout. A generous, fluffy omelet sandwiched between avocado slices, ciabatta and a sweet-ish tomato chutney. It was brilliant, huge and I would eat it again. And again. So that's a winner right there.What didn't I like? The guys on shift probably partied until 4am and decided to bring their music to work. Bad trance music in a coffee shop is just wrong. Especially at 2pm on a Saturday. That gave me a headache and I shouldn't be getting one at a place where there's a toilet bowl watching me eat.","90":"4-stars only for the coffee.I normally order a flat white or cappuccino here. They have a Slayer(tm) coffee machine and do their shots right.Come here only for the coffee. For dessert, you're better off wandering over to Rochester or Star Vista.","91":"Coffee was good, food was decent. Portions were slightly too small. Service was spotty although staff were sincere.Prices could have been slightly lower, especially given the location.","92":"This is one of my favorite tucked-away places to go. The coffee is flavorful & beautifully prepared with a delicious little biscotti that I can't get enough of. The food is delicious and uncomplicated. The staff is friendly and unpretentious. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Free wifi if you need it. Quirky & clever little bits all around to show you that the proprietor & his staff enjoy what they do.","93":"They neither serve Jimmy nor Monkeys.... But for a quant place to grab a smoothie or cup of coffee and a light bite this might be a good stop. \u00c2\u00a0 Tried the pulled pork sandwich on a buttered bun served with potatoes lyonnaise and also tried the tartine called \"the hulk\" - open face rustic bread sandwich covered in avocado and feta served on a bed of arugula. \u00c2\u00a0The banana-strawberry smoothie was \"nice\" (says the SPG) and the mocha was delightful!","94":"I love this place for its quaint-ness. Out of the place (a short walk from One North MRT) but convenient if you have a car.Good place to chill out on a weekend afternoon but it might be a bit crowded to get some reading done.Absolutely love the washrooms as it was decorated so beautifully with bookshelves (my absolute dream intention to my own bathroom) with books and cards!","95":"Imagine a hipster cafe with above average prices and decidedly average food.Congratulations, you've successfully imagined Jimmy Monkey Cafe & Bar.In all seriousness, I found the food to be decent but not worth raving about or coming back for. \u00c2\u00a0It seemed as though JMC&B was trying to get that Saturday morning breakfast cafe feel, like the ones that you'd find by the beach in California or Hawaii, but they fell a bit short. \u00c2\u00a0If they're going to charge the prices they do, I feel there should be something special that sets them at least a little bit apart, but I didn't think there was anything that special here.Last mark against them is the lack of space. \u00c2\u00a0JMC&B feels very cramped, as we were slotted into what felt like a tiny corner of a wooden shack.","96":"Espresso - this was a potent, robust and strong shot with a lingering aftertaste, but also a good balance of taste and flavours. This is not surprising - Jimmy Monkey's Ironbark blend is a combination of beans from Brazil (Cerrado), Papua New Guinea (Sigri), Columbia (Kachru), Guatamala (La Laguna) and Peru (Amazonas). There is also a Columbian single origin blend available, which works well in pourover coffee. Each bean variety contributes something unique to the shot - hints of citrus, and even some chocolate notes. Ironbark is a blend that is still evolving, and is now on it's third iteration. The experimentation has paid off, leaving a full bodied shot with a lingering aftertaste.The cappuccino that I ordered was notable for the initial strong hit of coffee flavour, complemented by smooth, light foam and finished with well executed latte art. The microbubbles in the foam add the smooth, silky mouthfeel that I look for, and is seen in quality cafes. This is where Ironbark is used to good effect - the lingering aftertaste is a strong base for a milk based drink, ensuring that the fundamental coffee character is retained.I had a Piccolo also, which is characterised by a more robust coffee taste, with the aftertaste lasting through the milk and foam. The milk complements the robust coffee flavour, smoothing it but not smothering it, creating a hybrid which retains the best characteristics of each - its just right and well executed. Their original place in the piccolo latte hall of fame post is deserved, and retained. There are also pourover, syphon and chemex coffees available. This is a good choice for anyone in the West of the island, and worth a quick trip on the MRT for coffee lovers elsewhere.","97":"Catfish and rice ($22++) - 3.5 starsThe catfish was a little like fish and chips! Some bits of the rice tasted a little funky but overall not bad. Good amount of salad.Jambalaya pasta ($22++) - 3 starsThe snapper tasted a little fishy.3P burger ($24++) - 4 starsStole some of my friend's. Pretty good pulled pork!Ambience - 5 starsOverall, a cosy place but I was most impressed by the sound system and the open mic on Thursday. We made reservations (easily done through Chope) and got seats right by the stage and even then it never sounded too loud or scratchy. You can hear the singers from outside as well.","98":"Order the chicken and waffles but the chicken was undercooked. Great selection of spirits. I tried a random moonshine they made on site by recommendation of the bartender.","99":"We came here for YUBE (Yelp Unofficial Brunch Event) and as there were 10 of us. and we were like-minded, we ordered all the 8 mains in the brunch menu to share. I must confess I got lost after a while as some dishes seemed a bit similar, especially those with biscuits. But what I had and remembered was pretty good. I do love the mac and cheese burger. The mac and cheese was beautifully done with just the right amount of cheese to hold the macaroni together to make it as the \"bun\". The chicken and waffle was unfortunately, quite forgettable. I did like the bourbon maple butter sauce though. I liked the hash brown in the duck hash, and the steak was decent in the steak and egg though it did not look that pretty. Pulled pork hash and Dutch baby pancakes were equally yummy. The service was pretty awesome and very accommodating. We were a noisy bunch on the 2nd level which was thankfully powered with strong air conditioning. It was quite warm on the ground level. Washrooms are also on the ground floor. I will be back for more mac and cheese burger, and I will not be sharing that next time! Well, maybe with just one person but not a big group. It was that good to me.","100":"Love this place, the owner Jamie is awesome!!! Great place to chill and have a few beers with friends. \u00c2\u00a0Great beer selection. The burgers are great as well you will not leave hungry!","101":"Yep Yep ...... I'm back here again I spend my Sunday afternoon dating fellow yelper Carolyn as we are both craving for the Mac Cheese Burger since the last YUBE I attended.The 1st time I visted we are seated at the level 2 of the restaurant and we order quite a big variety of food.This is my 2nd visit to The Beast, this restaurant was located at the corner near jalan klapa road which was near to the main road. This time we were seated at level 1 indoor. It's a little squeezy and there aren't much table maybe because they have outdoor seating too.The serving was fast and both of us order the same dish Mac Cheese Burger which is super cheesy and yummy. Once you cut it the cheese just ooze out. The Mac Cheese patties was near to a inch thick and it's accompanied by lettuce, tomato and a thick beef patty. The combination was so well for us. We paid $26.00 for it and I guess I'm cheese overloadThe place serve all day brunch and it seems that the dinner menu is awesome too. Thumps up for the good service by the crew. You guys did a great job.Need to book in my calender for the next dinner date to try on the rest of the menu which they offer.","102":"To improve - customer service on taking reservation. Made reservation in the afternoon for 2pax @ 7pm. However due to bad traffic, we can only make it at around 7.30pm. Called the beast to make changes, sadly they did not took my reservation in the afternoon and ended up allocated us outdoor (given singapore's humid weather) instead due to overwhelming reservation. Food - chicken waffle. Chicken was so damn good, skin was crispy and meat was tender. but waffles is abit on the salty side, actually I was expecting something sweet on the waffle. But I think it's base on individual preference. Truffle fries and chicken wings were average. Beast Caesar salad can be improved coz it taste kinda meh.Environment - haven't tried their indoor. But outdoor is still quite doable with (live) music playing. As this is the \"dengue\" month, it's advisable to bring insect repellant along. Coz that's what I saw patron from the table beside us brought.Waitresses - although we are assign to sit outside, the service is still quite prompt. Manage to chat up with their friendly waitresses while they were clearing the plates. Price - a little bit pricey, $170 for 2pax.Overall, it's still worth a try.","103":"You can't miss this! Coming along Victoria St.The Beast is a pretty small shop, with a long perimeter which they use to expand their seating area. So don't expect to be seated in an air-conditioned cafe.The interior only has bar top seating.Here's their sunday brunch menu.1. Bacon Maple Donut $5I was really looking forward to this, even though this sounded so sinful. It arrived on a plate with strawberries, which were quite sour. The bacon on the top, being drenched in maple syrup tasted like bak kwa. I quite liked it. But as you bite into the donut, this is where the disappointment hits you.It felt like I was biting into a very hard piece of cardboard. It was so hard, this donut was fried for too long and it just wasn't nice. This was quite saddening, as I had high hopes for this.2. Fried Chicken and Waffle $20Having tried other chicken and waffles offering in Singapore, everyone told me to try this one out as it was the most authentic? Having lived in the US for a few years. Nothing about this strikes me as authentic. Where's the coleslaw? Okay, at least the syrup is still here with the chicken! The waffle looked so pale, when it first arrived I had thought of asking them to heat it in the waffle iron longer? The waffle looked so white!The chicken was crispy and succulent. We had a choice between thigh and breast meat. We went for the thigh which was their more popular choice. The waffle was too light and airy, it felt like you were biting into air pocket. It was not crispy at all. Another total disappointment. This is by far the worst waffle I had every had.I felt like I had wasted my time coming here, there's way better options in Bukit Ho Swee and Dhoby Ghaut!","104":"American Southern food!Southern, refers to the states in the south-east of the United States, where they have a unique set of cuisine from the rest of the US. Ask anyone who's walked into McD's and seen sweet tea on the menu or eaten at Waffle House.I lived for a number of years in ATL, and was here with a couple of friends (one of them hails from Atlanta) and the food passed the test. We went straight for the fried chicken, burgers and pork collar.The fried chicken and gravy is good. Moist on the inside, even the breast meat was tender. I found it a little too brown for my liking (perhaps due to the oil being too long in the fryer?) The gravy is also good without being salty. The biscuit was okay but not particularly fluffy. Waffle is crisp and not soggy. The burger patty is also done to your specifications (medium\/medium-rare if you ask for it).For dessert, we had the pecan pie and the bacon waffle sundae. Both good, and pretty close to what you can get in Georgia. Overall, decently good by Singapore standards, but obviously not the best or most authentic when compared to Southern food in 'merica. They also have a good collection of hard-to-find American craft beers. I was looking for Stone IPA, but it was sold out that evening. Looking forward to try a couple of favorites next time.The only thing I didn't see was fried okra and fried green tomatoes. I thought I'd never ever find proper Southern fare here in Singapore. But here it is, and it's fairly good (though not 100% authentic). Paula Deen would be proud. This place is legit, and I'm coming back.","105":"We went to The Beast on a Friday night. It wasn't too crowded and the atmosphere was very conducive for winding down at the end of the week - the low lights, music and low chatter of the other guests lulling you into a calm state.We had the truffle fries, bacon mac n cheese, buffalo wings and fried chicken, along with some beer and lemonade. The truffle fries were average, I think - hot and crispy with a hint of truffle aroma that disappeared fairly quickly. I was more interested in the \u00c2\u00a0mac n cheese. It was great, not the run of the mill type. The serving was small, but it was meant to be an appetiser anyway. There was a certain depth to the flavour of the cheese - either from the bacon or from adding some blue cheese into the sauce. Whatever it was, it kept me wanting more.The fried chicken was just that - fried chicken. It was not as greasy as those from fast food places, but the flavour was nothing unique. The gravy that came with it was nice though. I was quite disappointed with the buffalo wings. They were just fried chicken with hot sauce poured on top. Buffalo wings are supposed to be baked\/roasted with the sauce, but I doubt this one was. There were clearly areas on the wings that were untouched by the sauce and the flavour hadn't permeated into the meat. It was also more sour than spicy, so I got tired of it pretty quickly. For those four dishes, two bottles of beer and a glass of lemonade, our bill came up to $100.10, fairly expensive, but expected of the restaurants in that area.All in all, I think The Beast is an average place for food, but if drinks and socialising are more important to you, it's a nice place to hang out at.","106":"It's been five years since i had chicken and waffles, and this place hits the spot. The chicken was crispy deep fried and the waffles were super delicious, bu my favorite part is the bourbon maple syrup! Too good. Order thigh, not breast because mine came out dry.The 1 hour bottomless mimosa \/ DIY bloody mary was a nice touch too! You can mix as much hot sauce and garnishes as you want and they have so many different kinds.","107":"This place has recently launched some beastly brunches for the voracious appetites.It seems like a battle half-won for the Chicken & Waffles ($20), a monstrous hunk of deep-fried thigh on waffles. The chicken is excellently crunchy and tender, but the golden batter was too salty and thus one can't help but chomp it down with the partially deflated waffles for a balanced flavour. As a hard truth, the chicken tasted best when doused with the bourbon maple butter sauce. The Pulled Pork Hash $18 may very well typify the savage character of a beast. Imagine strands of meat ferociously teared apart and tossed with cubed potatoes, red peppers and BBQ sauce. But this Beast seems timid at heart for the taste was uninspiring and dry. A little more simmering of the pork with apple cider vinegar and chilli pepper may awake the soul of the Beast. Like most authentic Southern sweets , the desserts here do not go easy on sugar. I appreciate the thick Oreo crust of the Mississippi Mudpie ($14) but this strength also became its weakest link when the pie layer is as stubborn as a rock.The Bacon Waffle Sundae ($12) could be misleading for it is NOT a SUNDAE. But this can be forgiven because it delivered more than just a usual ice cream-waffle dessert. Accompanied by gooey butterscotch sauce, crunchy pecan brittles and a monstrous ball of Honey & Fig Ice Cream, the waffle itself has already surpassed the pallid version we've had earlier due to its sturdier structure and a distinct buttery notes. The crispy candied bacon was a bonus. \u00c2\u00a0But what I liked best was the bacon maple glazed donut ($5) which reminded me of a sticky sweet Bak Kwa bun that BreadTalk introduced years before or the \"Sweet Mother of Bacon\" from Artichoke. And it's actually a SIDE, not a DESSERT. Yes, petite in size but it may just be the wildest creature at the Beast.","108":"this place is hard for me to judge since there is such a contrast between upstairs and the ground floor. \u00c2\u00a0I like the ground floor much more due to the vide. \u00c2\u00a0the whiskey is pretty good if you like some of the American classics, but you will not find too many of the limited edition stuff... no Papi... but they have a selection that you wont be disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0they also have some good imported craft brews from Desuctes and even Magic Hat.now the on to the food. \u00c2\u00a0since it was only 2 of us we didn't go get the beast but we will next trip! \u00c2\u00a0the mac and cheese was ewey, gooey, greatness. \u00c2\u00a0the chicken wings could be some of the best i have found in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0the burger was pretty good but a slight hint of curry kinda threw me off. \u00c2\u00a0And for dessert chicken and waffles... yes please! \u00c2\u00a0they were excellent, with great crisp on the chicken (you can even get just the breast!!!) and the syrup was awesome.this place is cool if you can get over the load music and the service is 50\/50... but the food and drink selection is pretty great","109":"I hereby pass the crown of best sandwich in Singapore to The Beast's 3P sandwich. So much porkness hits you from all sides, it's simply delicious. Pulled pork + pork belly + bacon + apple slaw = heaven. It's a big sando, but even though I was double stuffed, I still found my way to get porked a bit further and finish it off.","110":"I had been meaning to try The Beast for some time after seeing that they served chicken and waffles and since my favorite place on Earth is Roscoe's in LA. While it's not quite up to the gold standard of Roscoe's, I thought The Beast was excellent. We all ordered the chicken and waffles and added a side of Mac and cheese with bacon and some fries. The chicken was moist and the buttermilk batter quite tasty. The waffles were very good and the bourbon maple syrup was excellent. All in all, a pretty darn good taste of home. The only downside was the service was only so-so. We sat outside and they seemed to be more focussed on the guests inside and a party upstairs - we waited over 20 minutes for an ice tea refill (which never came and we eventually cancelled). \u00c2\u00a0It took them almost 15 minutes to run my card after the bill got there. We weren't Ina rush so it wasn't a giant pain but was was not top notch customer care.The place is also a bar so is not really family friendly. Despite the no smoking signs, the table next to us was filled with smokers and this staff didn't seem to care (it was outside though). Pretty noisy and rowdy even for an early week day dinner. With that said,no will be back - the food made the trip worth it and I am anxious to try and great selection of bourbons!","111":"Had the pork hash and big biscuit. Pork hash was flavorful and complements the home fries. Biscuit and fried chicken was hearty and the gravy was decent. Pretty close to what you would get in the states. Coffee was not good though the bottomless mimosa makes up for it :)","112":"Not a bad place, but just average or maybe a smidge above a average. Fried chicken was a good fry - crispy wonderful skin and moist on the inside. Flavour was not that special though and the weird watery gravy that came with was pointless. Mac and cheese had a nice bacon-y touch. Buffalo wings had insufficient sauce. Lots of craft beer! (But pricey and no happy hour for craft beer. Sad.)","113":"When I first moved here I thought all western food in Singapore had to include baked beans, spaghetti and chicken cutlet on the menu. \u00c2\u00a0Actually there's been some great places opening the past few years. \u00c2\u00a0Someone suggested checking out this \"American\" restaurant so obviously it captured my interest (being American and all). \u00c2\u00a0When I say awesome I mean it in every sense of the word. \u00c2\u00a0To start its located a little off the beaten path. \u00c2\u00a0Its down from Arab St. \u00c2\u00a0Its a small little place with mainly outdoor seating and a few tables inside. Its cozy though and had a guy from Michigan singing cover songs. \u00c2\u00a0They have a nice menu of basically southern food and large selection of bourbon and whiskey. \u00c2\u00a0Its a nice spot to grab a drink or chill for dinner. Its not fancy or pretentious.So the food. \u00c2\u00a0The menu items are good. Its not a large menu but has a nice selection of plates to share and they were all pretty good. \u00c2\u00a0The buffalo wings were spicy which I love, the soft shelled crab sliders were good but not my favorite, pulled pork sliders were great, fried mozzarella sticks were good but basically mozzarella sticks so not super exciting and the bacon mac and cheese was super creamy and delicious. \u00c2\u00a0They have a number of mains which all looked good but there is one that catches your eye. \u00c2\u00a0THE BEAST!! I've never seen a burger THIS big. I dont even know how to classify it because it defies all logic...1.6 lbs beef patty, 1 lbs of pulled pork, 1 lbs of southern fried chicken, cole slaw, lettuce, tomatoes and probably a goat somewhere in there. \u00c2\u00a0Its all piled on top of \u00c2\u00a0a 9 inch bun (everything is in inches and pounds-truly American). \u00c2\u00a0The label states \"adequately feeds 2 stoners or 4 regular adults\". We shared it among 6 people with the appetizers. \u00c2\u00a0It was more than enough. Apparently if one person finishes it in an hour you get it for free which is kind of like saying if you jump off a building you don't have to pay for the ride down. \u00c2\u00a0 Attempt at you're own risk.","114":"I've been dying to find a Southern meal in Singapore e.g. Chicken &amp; waffles or biscuits &amp; gravy for breakfast but nothing seemed to have met my expectations. Well, i finally checked out the new Sunday Brunch at The Beast. Southern comfort food say what! It's time to get started thinking about bacon maple glazed doughnuts and lotsa bourbon. For starters, make sure you order yourself some Cornbread ($6). I love this one! It's way better than Kenny Rogers corn muffin which sometimes has these really strange chewy corn kernels. Expect a nice brown crust with a fragrant corn perfume. Make sure you dip into the maple syrup. Chicken and Waffles ($20) cannot be missed as well. Ok mainly the Southern fried chicken cannot be missed. The waffles are an afterthought (it was bland and thin) but that massive juicy chicken steak was flavorful and addictive. I still can't get over how much fried chicken i ate. The bourbon maple butter sauce added that little alcoholic bitterness and light sweetness to the overall flavor.The Pulled Pork Hash ($18) features a 10 hour pulled pork with bbq sauce that wasn't too overpowering. BBQ sauce has got to be my least favorite sauce of all time but this was quite enjoyable. The poached egg gave the dish a nice yolky moisture which made it even tastier. I could imagine this dish being made into a sandwich a la momofuku style.Biscuits are a huge part of Soul food and so we had to have the Sausage Biscuit ($18). It came with buttermilk biscuit, sausage patty, truffled mushrooms, swiss cheese and a sunny side up. The sausage gravy was sinfully flavorful (you really don't wanna know how gravy is made), but the biscuit and sausage were on the bland side. On the whole, it was sufficiently tasty. Bacon Maple Glazed doughnut ($5) was of a lovely density and had a nice crispy shell. It may be a little oily, and it also had that hint of oily taste but it's such comfort food! I couldn't help taking a few more bites.Our other dessert was the Mississippi Mudpie ($14). Well it's just boring ice cream really. It's not that it isn't tasty, but we were too stuffed to tackle my preferred Bourbon Pecan Pie with fig and honey ice cream ($12).We had an awesome time at The Beast. Food is really the highlight here. But be warned, make sure you keep the entire day free because you wouldn't be able to get out of that food induced coma after the meal. The good news is that you only need one meal for the day. Heh.The booze that we had were less than adequate however. Skip the sangria for it was way too diluted for me. The Mimosa was ok but it was more OJ than white sparkling wine. But I guess it works out ok if you do the 1h free flow version.","115":"Food could definitely use improvement and place is uncomfortable!We were seated inside, around a barrel - which looks cool, but perched on a bar stool next to a barrel isn't most conducive to enjoying a burger!We were here with friends, and ordered some cocktails - all of which were tiny for the price!My husband and I ordered the BEAST burger to share, because why not?The chicken was inedible - all gristle and fat!The burger meat was dry and a bit bland, and the pulled pork was the only thing that was tasty and good.I think this place is far from a 'cool southern diner' which is what they market themselves to be - save your money and go to MeatSmith!","116":"The bourbon selection is outstanding, Kentucky would be proud! For sure not the best southern food I have had, enough to to make my southern momma sad. No fried pickles or okra, One of my favorite dishes, fried chicken and waffles, was pretty bland and very greasy. Although the country boy burger had pimento cheese on it.. It tasted like it was cooked on a stove top. The music was great but the service was slow and apateticI'll comeback for the bourbon flights and will still be dreaming of Waffle House and Zaxbys.","117":"This was one of my favorite finds in Singapore! When we visited over the Singapore Day holiday weekend, the vibe felt relaxed and chill. The service was very attentive and we enjoyed an evening of great food and drink. Their chili crab dip waffle fries were amazing and I loved their cocktail with the lemongrass-infused vodka. Definitely recommend and hope to return next time I'm in town.","118":"Love this hidden gem in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0Though it's not on top of a 50 floor skyscraper (it's on the 3rd floor of an office building), Loof is unpretentious, has great eats and drinks, and has a great outdoor patio vibe.Some coworkers took us here for happy hour after one one day. \u00c2\u00a0Drinks and appies were on special ('cheap' by Singapore standards). \u00c2\u00a0Boozy bubble tea? I'm sold! \u00c2\u00a0They even serve it in a bubble tea plastic cup and straw. \u00c2\u00a0The appies were good but the BEST were the chili crab waffle fries. TBH, it's actually chili crab DIP but it was DA BOMB! \u00c2\u00a0Next time I am back i Singapore, I will definitely make a return visit up on the Loof!","119":"Nice, casual rooftop (3rd floor, no views) bar - it comes up in lists of best rooftop bars in Singapore, but I would not expect much. Crowd here is young, maybe they're coming for the happy hour specials. I took advantage of the Prosecco HH price of $11 a glass as opposed to the regular $18 a glass. Food options are limited but do the job, we got the chicken satay and shiitake mushrooms.","120":"3.5 starsWhereas a lot of rooftop bars are snobby affairs, Loof is everything except snobby. This bar has a fun and relaxed vibe. Additionally, the happy hour is one of the better deals you can find in Singapore: glasses of house pours, wine and pints of Asahi for $5++, hard to find a better deal!But unfortunately this bar has also some minor downsides:- the red wine comes chilled (WHY?)- the food menu looks inventive and attractive but has never managed to fully convince. The Ramly burger is probably my fave, but as far as the other dishes I feel like the food is: \"nice try but try again...\"But overall this is one of my goto rooftop bar's and I have been back several times so when in doubt between 3 and 4 stars, I decided to give them 4 stars cause I think the concept is great, it is decently priced and just because I like it there! Also, when I think about this bar, I cannot help it but \u00c2\u00a0sing in my head: \"the loof, the loof, the loof is on fire!!\"","121":"Awesome, hip spot right across from the Raffles hotel. Beautiful rooftop bar and wonderful happy hour spot. Their happy hour goes by the hour, so $5 SGD from 5-5:59, $6 SGD from 6-6:59, $7 SGD from 7-7:59, etc for well drinks. Pint-sized draft beers (Asahi black on draft, what!) are $10 in happy hour. THE DRINKSThe cocktails were the star of the show. Each was named after another famous Asian city or locaiton. My favorite was the Ginger Java - served with a grapefruit slice inside the middle. The Ho Chi Minh had wonderful mint and cucumber tastes, with gin. Lovely. THE FOODWe came here to try to infamous (even Ho Ching recommends them) Chili crab cheese fries. This is an interesting fusion idea, as is most of the food. I liked it, but I think I prefer traditional Chili cheese fries or Chili crab. The crab and Asian chili made it a little too sweet for my taste, but it was interesting. We also tried the roast duck and plum eggrolls, which were a bit overdone but not bad. Finally, we had the very nice happy hour sesame chicken wings. They were well fried and the glaze had a good flavor. THE SERVICE AND SETTINGAs mentioned, this is the perfect get together spot. Tables inside and out, with beautiful and lush greenery all over. The decor is modern and hip, and very inviting for you to linger and enjoy a Singaporean evening. The service is great and the waiters are friendly, helpful, and eager to serve. Would happily come back for any reason - happy hour, girls night out, date night, or a birthday party.","122":"Came here with work crew for happy hour; it was a great location with an amenable atmosphere the staff were pleasant but not overly friendly which is odd for a bar.We came to happy hour but were surprised that beer was not really included in the cheap drinks, only basic spirits and house wines; and even with the spirits they seemed unwilling to offer shots and it took an amount of negotiation to get this.We tried a lot of the food, from platters, snacks, finger foods and everything was well made and had a good amount of spice if the dish warranted it.The place was really happening by around 10pm; and it's great that they take bookings so if you wanted to head out at that time you can.","123":"This is a hidden gem in Singapore.. Roof top bar that caters for every different occasion. That is one that has drinks involved.For this occasion it was for birthday drinks, and it caters well for this. The staff were great, paid attention to the need for drinks and food.For the beer lovers, you can buy jugs to share, and the wine and cocktail list are more than adequate.Food was awesome, sharing plates, the hot chips with Chilli Crab.. Amazing... Spicy edemame and other great dishes.. Including 'hot as shit' chicks wings..For entertainment they have a 'beer pong' table, and that's where the real fun begins...","124":"Need a great happy hour spot or after dinner drinks? Loof is a good call. I was drinking their non-alcoholic Spa Splash with cucumber, mint and apple juice. Light, refreshing and not straight sugar. I was a happy girl. Not on the happy hour menu, though. The food menu consisted of some creative bar food. Chicken lettuce pockets were great, as were the chicken wings. The French fries came in a huge portion. The salad with calamari was awesome and probably the healthiest thing we ordered. Trying to follow paleo diet? This place isn't for you!The atmosphere was hopping with music cranked and patrons enjoying what appeared to be a game of beer pong. It was fun, but a bit tough to hear our company. Single lady? This place seems to be swimming with guys in their 20s and 30s. Just saying. You're welcome!","125":"Drinks were rather expensive. For a rooftop bar, it also doesn't have much of a view, since it's dwarfed by every other building surrounding it. Happy hour is ok though.Come with your expectations lowered, and you'll be fine - think of it not as a rooftop bar, but as an upscale dive bar that happens to be on a low rooftop","126":"We chance upon this place while researching for a decent restaurant to celebrate the birthday for a friend of mine. The setting of the bar looks really decent and heard some good reviews hence decided to visit this establishment. We spend a good 10mins trying to locate the place with the help of Google map. The signage to show the lift was not obvious and we had to circle the building just to find the sign. To ensure that I have a seat, I made a reservation via Chope (it is a pretty decent site), with an email reminder and a call from the bar, I felt that the before service was really well done. With high expectation, we were ushered to the long tables alongside of the bar-top and were given the menu. The menu was pretty detailed and with the help of online recommendation we order a couple of sides, mainly the Chili crab cheese fries, the happy hour chicken wings and a Kong ba bao (bun with pork). The food took some time to arrive and truth to be told, it was not really as fantastic as many mention. The fries were soggy, the wings were a tack too dry and salty, and the kong ba bao was not worth the money.However, my friends felt that the fries and wings were pretty decent thus the taste is up to your discretion. My friends order a couple of mixer to top it up since there is Happy Hour deals. But the drinks were quite disappointing and it tasted a little weird to us. At the very end, we did not finish the drinks. The service staff are friendly but the food took some time to arrive. The venue setting has really nice lighting and display however the music was just average. Hence if you are looking for a place to drink, I will not highly recommend this place. But it is still decent for the atmosphere with the open roof top concept.Improvement is needed on the speed of serving food and the quality of the drinks.","127":"Great location; outdoor watering hole. Review for the ambience and HH only. I like the chilled vibes and they have happy hour that goes by the hour e.g $5+ at 5pm; $6+ at 6pm etc. ends at 8pm. I missed out on HH this time because of a private event but will be back next time for HH and the food (interesting Asian fusion menu like chili crab cheese fries)!","128":"Loof is great for one reason and one reason only: Beirutin less classy circles, this would be referred to as Beer Pong, but all of us Ivy boys know what the true name is and will always be. Loof is one of the few places in Singapore where you can play this game. the tables are too short and too low, but they have cut outs for the cups which is pretty damn convenient.it's a little bit too hot for me, as it's outdoors on the roof, and me being an American i just can't handle singapore's heat. the drinks are nothing to write home about, as stated, Beirut is the only reason why Loof deserves a visit.","129":"I love Loof and it's time to tell people why. I'm gonna share it with everyone, cos I'm nice that way. HahahaAlright. So Loof has some really yummy dishes but my two faves are still their chicken wings (damn, super addictive!!!) and their chili crab fries (super Moreish!!!). These are just simply fantastic - like, mouthwateringly, finger-lickingly goooooood. Great wait staff. Service with a smile. My friend and I sat the bar, and suddenly the bartender sends us shooters he created. Just for fun. To let us try. For free. We compliment him on a refreshing shooter; he beams. And before we know it, he makes another round for us. On the house. Like, whaaaaaa?!?Ok. No no. All of that are great. But the reason why Loof deserves five stars is this -- their happy hour deals on house wines and house pours. 5-6pm = $56-7pm = $67-8pm = $7'nuff said. You're welcome.","130":"Cool bar on nice rooftop with a lounge vibe, and good happy hour discounts. The place gets pretty packed on Fridays with the after-work crowd. The waiters can't seem to keep track of payments and went around asking who was it that just gave them a credit card for payment in order to return the card.","131":"Great location, cold beer and wonderful bar foodThe chilli crab dip is the best I've had and the other food items were also pretty goodA novel approach to happy hour where the drinks go up $1 on the hour. Drink quickly!","132":"I was there for the Bobbi's Pole Studio Amateur night and honestly I was not very impress with this place because well, the service is just interesting. As the place was quite crowded I had no choice but to take a standing table... I informed the staff that my ankle was injured (due to a sprain) and I hope to have a chair for me.. and the staff had to ASK for permission before a chair was brought over to me. I was like really? Ask for permission to let an injured person sit down? If not, do I have to stand for the whole night? Really makes you wonder. Honestly, I found the place a \u00c2\u00a0bit too cramped for my liking and I was quite fascinated with how the waiting staff kept running about and not saying \"excuse me\" while nudging their way through the crowd.. I thought they will at least have basic courtesy to say \"excuse me.\" but i guess I was wrong. Drinks wise its ok and I can't say much about the view as its blocked by buildings higher than where the Loof was situated. So yeaps. I guess it's alright?","133":"Googled rooftop bars in Singapore. Loof was in the Top 10. Like most hangouts in the city, this may seem a bit pricey. Had some cocktails along with few appetizers. The chili crab cheese fries stood out. The chicken wings and chicken lettuce wraps were average.","134":"The newly renovated rooftop bar atop Odeon Towers has been hosting events since its inception, ranging from more high-profile ones such as the Giles Peterson events, and more recently, Tete-a-Tete which is an event where people get together and converse in foreign languages. The bosses of Loof were highly successful in marketing their concept, and have since opened The White Rabbit and Tanjong Beach Club. What sets Loof apart from your average bar is the choice of bar snacks. Tiger Toast ($9) with minced tiger prawns placed atop a lightly toasted piece of bread was very special. Their Loof Flies ($9), which essentially is French Fries with a variety of dips (wasabi, curry, chilli) was extremely addictive. It came in a bucket, and before the bucket was half full, we asked the waiter to get us another plate of sauces. Other interesting things on their menu are crayfish and babysquid, perhaps will try it another day.As for drinks, they have a standard range of wine and spirits. Try their Loof Life ($17), it is most refreshing with the zesty lime aftertaste. The Gummiberry ($17) is a drink I would recommend the girls, as the meringue (which the bartender slightly burns with his flame before serving) looks really pretty in pictures and tastes just as sweet as it looks too. Post-renovation, they updated their cocktail list to feature \"Asian Sensations\" - Ho Chi Mint, Penang Padi etc. Will definitely go back to try those ingeniously titled cocktails one day.","135":"One of the more touristy places\/bars. Drinks- Gummiberry (definitely a must try for ladies who love meringue). It's a fragrant concoction of forest berries, gin, Cointreau and French meringue. - The chocolate martini is an interesting concept but taste pretty average. - The other stuff is pretty standard. Food (typical bar finger food)- They use to have Monday Satays but now it's gone :( their satays were great! - Mini salmon pizza - pretty decent. Ambiance- It's a outdoor bar so it's pretty nice to when the weather isn't too hot or if it's not raining. Otherwise, probably should pass for the night. - The have limited number of indoor seats, comfy tanks with big fluffy pillows (as I recalled). \u00c2\u00a0If you can score one, it's probably a good place to catch up with friends. - Occasionally, they have a DJ too.","136":"Came here thought there is a happy hour on Saturday n told the waiter I want a happy hour red wine! He didn't say anything n ask my credit card to hold! That not a good service from the waiter from the loof!! Stay away loof on weekend as the drink cost SG$16 per glass as per weekday is max $8 during happy hour before 8 pm.. It is double the price!!","137":"Came to check out this place for lunch. I ordered Fresh Toast, which came with a canned drink for a total of S$10. Apparently they are having this lunch deal promo (Mon-Fri from 12-3 pm) for S$10, S$12, S$14 price - depending on what you order. Do take a look at one of the pictures I posted along with this review - to see a complete list.Going back to the French Toast I ordered, I really love it. The french toast is focaccia french toast - it came with slices of apples and peaches, and was drizzled with honey and rolled oats.The sweetness was just nice. The texture was great. The portion was quite big. If you plan to come here with one other person, it might be a great idea to order another dish - maybe the savory one. My friend ordered a burger that comes with curly fries. Man, I love the fries here. I think they put some herbs, which makes the fries smelled fragrant, and the crunchiness and thickness were just right. I think I might come again to this place just for the fries.They do have some interesting drinks, i.e. bandung latte and dirty bandung latte. Babycinno is basically just a cappuccino, but in a smaller serving.The reason of why I don't give 5 stars is because food may take quite sometime to be served. So it's a good idea to come here before you are really starving.I do recommend coming to this place for lunch. I love the vibrant atmosphere of the area, as well as for the lunch set deal itself. Definitely worth every penny =)","138":"Don't waste your money, it's all frozen food just deep fried. There is NO service, no once cares it's like as if you are doing them a favor by eating there. Wish I would have listened to all the other yelpers. Also do not go the toilet to was your hands, you have been warned. Top it off the prices are ridiculously high, do you self a favor and walk down the street to I Am Burgers similar pricing however the food is fresh and you get service from the staff whom appreciate you coming there. Now for the food :1. Over priced2. All frozen, Deep fried and oily3. Juices are NOT juices, they are sofa water with syrup which they do not even stir.There's 5 of us and we tried to order :Mushroom appetizer;we just ran outmushroom burger; we just ran outPizza; \u00c2\u00a0staff states I do not recommend ordering, why oh it will take too long 30-40 min, then why do you have on the menu.See pictures food is presentable but NOT worth the SG$140 we where charged for frozen food. PLEASE Note you have been warned , do not go here.","139":"\"Come here for free perfume - Eau de Deep Fryer\"Another Friday, another team lunch.So today, the team decided to check out Working Title - a caf\u00c3\u00a9 located at the tail end of Arab Street towards Beach Road in the Malay enclave of Kampung Glam. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 looks pretty neat and old school, with the use of floppy disk to tell you the wifi password (YES! Free wifi, such rarity in Singapore), used beer bottles as vase on each table and a very charming courtyard behind the main dining area. The courtyard looks like a nice meeting place for small groups but with the almost translucent roof, meaning a lot of natural light to the extent of almost too bright, the 5 of us decided to sit in the main dining area instead. Now the main problem at the dining area or should I say the setup of this caf\u00c3\u00a9 is the built in kitchen right in the main dining hall itself. If you want to have a open concept kitchen, you better make damn sure that the suction is working damn good and the ventilation is world class standard. But unfortunately for this caf\u00c3\u00a9, the suction they used is nothing but cheap ones and ventilation? If you call air-con blasting to ventilate the entire place together with the smell of oil all over, then yes, it's ventilation. \u00c2\u00a0But I don't think the right term for ventilation is what I just described.Food wise, it was alright. \u00c2\u00a0There are 3 versions of set lunch available with fancy names and price ranging from $9.90 to $14.90. You get a main and juice \/ iced tea. If you want to change to coffee, you will have to top up some amount of money. We ordered a couple of items from the menu - smoked salmon focaccia, beef burger and the big breakfast (not in set lunch) and we didn't enjoyed as much as we were rushing to quickly finish our food and get out from there. \u00c2\u00a0I will never ever come back to this place again for lunch unless they move the kitchen elsewhere. We're a bunch of office workers, dressed up in formal wear and imagine, all our hair and body smell like used oil from the deep fryer after lunch at this place. Tragic. P\/s: the staffs are clueless about the 10% yelp discount and was told you cant use that for set lunch which i thk it's rather stupid and irrelevent.","140":"My girlfriends decided to have our monthly Sunday brunch here after reading positive reviews about this place. But it turns out nothing as what we expected. Here goes. Unlike other brunch places on Sunday, this place is empty when we reach. Looks dingy. Ordering of food is self service. Same goes for water and condiments. They use Heinz packet chilli sauce. Very western-stall-in-local-coffeeshop feel.Starting off with satay sauce fries, served lukewarm, I would say it's just blah. You can even replicate it yourself. Just go McDonald's to get their fries then any satay stall for the peanut sauce and ta-dah, satay sauce fries. It is cheaper this way too.Don't know how long has passed, their Working Big Breakfast that I ordered came. The plate is pretty packed which is a sight I love. It has 3 slices of ham, a chicken sausage, salad, 2 slices of bread, a sunny side up and 2 pieces of turkey bacon etc. However, the only thing that is hot is my chicken sausage. The rest on the plate is at room temperature. Bread was untoasted. Dried mixed herb was sprinkled on the ham slices which puzzles me. It doesn't improve the presentation or even taste good. As for the salad, there is no dressing.My friend had their Gula Chicken Sausage. She was also disappointed with her food as the only hot food is the Gula Melaka caramelized onions which we find not bad. My another friend who is a vegetarian ordered the portobello egg and cheese. They have replaced the bacon for some tofu cubes. Not sure what to feel about this combination as it is pretty new to us too. Tl;dr: won't be coming back here again. Simple breakfast ingredients dumped on a plate. Tad overpriced imo.","141":"Extremely disappointed!!! How this place could have more than 2 stars. Had there a classic burger and could not imagine that a \"burger bar\" (it is how they call this place) could have that awful burgers !!!!I feel like they use a cat food meat in their burgers! To be short, I hope that the owner or manager would read my review and WILL fix a problem with a meat suppliers","142":"Cute little cafe on Arab street serving great breakfast, cakes, sandwiches and much more. The small courtyard at the back is ideal for relaxing with a good book or great friends. Love the interior and the service is also great. The cafe has an entrance to the hostel upstairs so you will find many travellers enjoying their time here.","143":"Menu mentioned truffle fries but was served normal curly fries in mine, asked them to change and truffle powder was sprinkled on it before returning.Doubtful service: when ordering the staff was not sure if the yelp's 10% discount is available, and they had to ask their boss (who's not around). End up, some of my friends have the discount and some don't, depending on who you were being served by. Apparently I heard that if the boss is around, standards will be very good. So we were unlucky...Maybe the coffee is better but we were there for lunch so didn't get coffee. The pizza was served over some baking paper like thingy. It stuck to the paper and my friends have to pry them out to eat. Can tell the pizza is not freshly made but was pre made and re-toasted in the oven, \u00c2\u00a0it stuck to the paper. And the toppings look pretty meager and sad...Overall I don't recommend this place and I will not come back again.","144":"I'm almost hesitant to write a review about this place because of how much I like it, for the fear of it being flooded by the fake hipsters from (the dangerously close) Haji Lane.My principle for patronising a cafe is very simple. I try not to go to ones that has appeared on a list of any sort, you know the ones I'm talking about- \"10 great cafes for coffee hopping\" on some random \"cool\" blog shared by 3482393 people on Facebook, chances are it's going to be overflowing with a crowd, the sort that takes 3482 top-down, generic-looking photos of their \"latte\" which they can't tell from their 3-in-1 instant coffee.Working Title on a weekday afternoon doesn't seem to suffer from these symptoms of cafe cancer that seems to be spreading to all establishments that appear on the likes of Timeout and 8 days.Prices were really moderate, a refreshing break from the other sorts whose goal is seemingly just to capitalise on the coffee\/cafe trend before it flops and dies like bubble tea. No GST or service either. Ammmazing.Combined with the 10% off upon first checkin on Yelp, it's a pretty good deal.$7 for a pretty decent slice of cake$6 for a rather huge pot of tea (interesting flavours brewed from real leaves)We didn't order much from the menu as we were just looking for a hopefully quiet location to sit down and spend the rest of the afternoon. Hopefully we'd be back for more in the future.Free, good, fast WiFi.Plenty of seats, a good outdoor area at the back which is enclosed with air-conditioning but with plenty of sunlight still. Suspicious noises came occasionally but nothing too disturbing to spoil the ambience entirely.There's music, not the loud top 40s shit that blares in your eardrums stopping you from having any kind of conversation.The decor is interesting. It is a haphazard combination of cheap swedish crap (read: IKEA) and other random odds and ends (wooden crates? Maybe stolen from The Bravery. At least here they put cushion on top!) but it works together very well. Doesn't come off as trying too hard.","145":"Cakes were nice... sandwiches were so-so... \u00c2\u00a0The tuna melt was tasty, but marred by having a very nasty cheese slice slapped on top rather than using fresh cheese.... \u00c2\u00a0The chairs, furniture etc. are a bit grubby...OK\/average, but nothing special.","146":"Work's been kinda crazy, so I've been on a Deliveroo binge. I'd heard a lot about the burgers from Working Title and decided to give the Baconator and the Honey Lemon Wings a try. The food arrived within half an hour. Despite being wrapped up in aluminium foil (not the best way to pack a delivery burger, IMHO), the burger was moist, still a little pink and pretty tasty. The patty was a little on the small side (which burger place in Sg isnt tho?) and because of the way it is shaped, hard to eat. Some bites were all bread, some were all meat. The turkey bacon and the caramelized onions were a nice touch, although I wish there was more mesclun and fries. Portions are small. If you're hungry, I'd recommend the Tower of Power (although two of those patties would be harder to eat!!) The wings were juicy but a tad on the sweet side (I'm more of a savoury person). Not bad considering it was delivered. Probably be much better eaten there","147":"Wondering down Arab St in Singapore started to have a very familiar feel to it. We suspected that we had stumbled across an indie (read: hipster) neighbourhood and decided to check out Working Title for some craft beer. Our suspicions were quickly confirmed when we spotted a table propped up by two old Mac computers, coasters made from floppy disks and a coffee blend \"feat. Kanye West\". We opted for a couple of pale ales in the courtyard and spent a relaxing hour or so reading the local street press and enjoying the sunshine. Great spot for a quiet beer and we even scored a discount for checking in on Yelp.","148":"Sitting there for almost the day. In fact, I have been hunting for cafe for the entire week to do my application. It's definitely an ideal place to relax. Nice atmosphere and vintage decoration. I order mint tea first and later, egg sandwich for lunch and then yogurt with corn flasks as dessert. A place that I will revisit for sure next time~!","149":"196 SGD (Singapore Dollar) for some crab and fish seems like we were gettin' played by our Singaporean brothas and sistuhs, but no, we just had no idea what the hell we were ordering. Just look at the sgd\/gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay, or that will satisfy ur belly. Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states! The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in. Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out! This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!! Happy hawking!!!","150":"Someone at the hotelWhere I am staying recommended this restaurant. After a walk in Chinatown we decided to come here. We got seated right away and we ordered the Alaska King Crab.1.3 kg ( half of the full crab ) about 200 SGD and we got the seafood noodles. The sauce for the Chili \u00c2\u00a0Alaska King crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what I was expecting.Service was also very disappointing, workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat. Felt like we were been hustled, peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table 2 SGD in the bill, bread rolls that I didn't even touch also put in the bill, at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it. I would not Recommend this place, way better other places in Singapore to have chili crabs \u00c2\u00a0.","151":"Jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs. My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement. Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs.","152":"Holy cow! Totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands. Waited all day to come try Jumbo Seafood for dinner and was so disappointed! The whole dining experience was meh. There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off. There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating. Nothing really wow'ed us, we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid. Honestly, every hawker stand we tried, the food was SO good! Being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip, we were slightly bitter and disappointed.","153":"A Singapore institution that never disappoints! \u00c2\u00a0Situated on the shores of the River, this beautiful setting in a warm Singapore evening watching the people cruise by.We started with a squid appetizer followed by Pepper Crab and Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Crab comes with amazing sauce that cannot be described. \u00c2\u00a0Perfect little dough balls for mopping up the extra sauce. \u00c2\u00a0Love this place.","154":"I am aware that Jumbo Seafood is a total tourist trap and that prices are high. That said, I was taken to a \"non-touristy\" chilli crab spot by someone who lived in Singapore previously and did not enjoy the crab at all. Since this was his first trip to Singapore, I figured why not go with Jumbo. I made a reservation for prime dinner time about 45 days in advance. You don't need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early.Since it was only the two of us, we didn't want to order too many items. We ended up getting:-Chilli crab (OMG, so good. So messy. So much fun. We ate in silence as we concentrated on getting all the crab meat out. I may have flung some crab onto the glass window next to where we were sitting. Oops!)-Fried buns (Perfect for soaking up the chilli sauce).-Cereal Prawns (Skip! Do not believe the hype, it was not worth it).We were in an out within an hour and were very satisfied with our seafood feast.","155":"Underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here. We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center. We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2. The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored.","156":"Came for the chili crab and was NOT disappointed. This stuff is so good and a cant miss in Singapore. I had found jumbo seafood on a list of best chili crab and had that recommendation seconded by a local so I couldn't say no! One chili crab is about the right size for two people and do no miss the bao buns on the side to soak up all that delicious chili crab sauce. Also prepared go get messy digging in! We had just a side of broccoli with the crab and honestly were so stuffed we didn't need any other sides. The wait was long but they take your name and number and Clarke Quay is a great place to walk around, so just expect it to take a little time for your turn!","157":"During my 3 days stay in Singapore in March of 2019, I cannot not try the Singapore Award Winning Chilly Crab here!! I was sooo excited to come, and I have to say, by far, it is the best crab I've ever had in my life!!The sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut. I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!! During the past 5 months, I have tried a couple of Malaysian and Chinese restaurants in the Northeast and haven't found anything that was close to this!! I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!! \u00c2\u00a0OMG, poor guy!!!We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive. I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!","158":"I really don't get the hype. A single chili crab was 88 SGD, which is about $65. For that kind of money, I could go to an AYCE buffet in Vegas and get unlimited crab legs. The flavor is pretty mediocre too. We ordered pea sprouts, but they were the baby kind, not the tastier, more mature kind. And some sort of scallops in taro which I could have done without. Actually I could have done without the whole meal. There are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other -- make sure you go to the right one. Reservations recommended. This place gets busy.","159":"A must-visit for visitors to Singapore, Jumbo Seafood is the place to come for the classic Singaporean dish of chili crab! It's messy (wear a bib!), it's spicy, it's sweet--it actually reminds me of the classic Chinese tomato and egg dish (perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients)! The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp! Luckily, the crispy, sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal, even eaten on its own!","160":"Went here during a business trip. Had to stop by twice to try two different type of crabs. Black pepper and chilly sauce crabs. We like the chilly one better","161":"Salted egg coated food. That's what this place is all about. My colleagues and I came here for dinner. None of us live here as it's super expensive to dine without expense account. The crab was ginormous. We ordered the set menu which is always the best. 9 of us, $100 a person. Totally worth it.Salted egg shrink and fish skin fried. Very Singaporean and very cool. Salted egg coated crab and pepper crab two way. Delicious. Great view if you were to sit outside as it's right by the bay. Grab home - as in, using your Grab app (Uber is no longer allowed since April in Singapore or Malaysia, good riddance if you ask me) and you should find a car sharing service nearby.I do love me some Singapore!","162":"Alaays good, expensive but always good. The chili crab, i have spent so much on those crabs.","163":"Everything about this place was great aside from the price. Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish.","164":"Really good seafood restaurant. The price is fair. For every bite of eaten, you can feel, yes, the seafood worth the price!","165":"1kg for s$88 for non swim crab, it is somewhat pricey and no service at all. \u00c2\u00a0They told the customers 2pm last call for ordering and the restaurant close at 3pm. \u00c2\u00a0A few tables came in around 1:30pm, they didn't come to us to play the order, when they finally do. \u00c2\u00a0The dishes took sometimes to come, then as you dig your hands into working on the crab, the waitress came asking for payment on the total. \u00c2\u00a0 All of us must clean our hands and get the money or card to pay first before continuing eating. This is for a pricy restaurant in the area and no customer service while they was not short hand at all, then they force you to drop everything to make payment. \u00c2\u00a0Unbelievable and unacceptable.","166":"Unfortunately my rating isnt about the food. I never got a chance to try anything. I have never felt so unwanted and disrespected in my life. I took a solo trip to singapore and was really looking forward to trying food from Jumbo. Especially after watching so many videos about it. Needless to say i should have payed attention to the fact only asians were on the videos. I had a 7pm reservation. Not even 2 minutes after being seated i was being rushed to order. I politely asked the waitress for a few minutes to look over the menu. 10 minutes later a new waitress comes and ask for my order. As i am trying to order my food she kept saying \"thats too much for you\" to everything. I asked aee you speaking of the portions or the price. I was well aware of what i would be spending. I am not a budget traveler. She did not answer and walked off. I payed for my tea with another waitress and walked out.","167":"Three things my Buds from the Red Dot said I must try- \u00c2\u00a0Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Bah Kuh Teh and \u00c2\u00a0Singapore Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0I crossed the first two at various hawker centers around town. \u00c2\u00a0For the Chili Crab many recommend me to come here. \u00c2\u00a0Arrived here via metro around 1300. \u00c2\u00a0Restaurant was at half capacity. \u00c2\u00a0The lunch rush crowd gone and no reservation needed. \u00c2\u00a0Yes!!!The food: Appetizer- shrimp with pumpkin pur\u00c3\u00a9e. \u00c2\u00a0Really good! \u00c2\u00a0Shrimp Fried Rice- Another great dish. \u00c2\u00a0Enough for 2 people.Main- Singapore Chili Crab. \u00c2\u00a0Excellent!! \u00c2\u00a0Very flavorful. \u00c2\u00a0Spice level was just right. \u00c2\u00a0Enough kick to enjoy. \u00c2\u00a0Generous portion and good to the last bite.Environment\/Service: Great! \u00c2\u00a0The waiter was very attentive. \u00c2\u00a0He also let me know I that I ordered enough for 2 people. \u00c2\u00a0Glad I stopped because I was about to order two more dishes. \u00c2\u00a0Love the bibs and large hand washing stations. \u00c2\u00a0You don't have that same luxury The meal was worth the price. \u00c2\u00a0Glad I listened to my buds that pointed me this way.","168":"Not worth the hype. \u00c2\u00a0Crab was good, but service was mediocre. \u00c2\u00a0Got in right away but we were there 10 mins before they opened. \u00c2\u00a0They forgot two of our entrees we ordered.

Tian tian was the original and occupies stalls 10-11.The rice plate comes in small, medium, large. The small is only 3.50 - it's nice to have the option of small so you \u00c2\u00a0can try more stuff. They also have other dishes, but the rice plate is the star. Order at line A and pickup at line B. The chicken rice is chicken breast (boneless and skinless), which I appreciate. It's super tender. The rice also has good chicken flavor. Warning: the hot sauce sauce is hot.","170":"Bookmarked this place so many years ago and is pretty much the only thing I know I wanted to check out in Singapore haha.No long lines, solid chicken and flavorful rice. They may keep my name.","171":"Okay, do bear in mind I have been to Singapore 8 or so times in the last 3 years.. Still have not made to this place until recently. I had one day that I was in Singapore before the work week started and I had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook. Botanical garden, orchid garden, garden by the bay's skywalk, Chinatown was next. So I arrived and it was hot - so I was very lost and was happy to be lost. Lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot. All I really wanted was Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. Truth be told, it's changed in the last decade, or maybe I've changed. The first time I had it was in 2010. I thought it was disgusting. I did not have any acquired taste for Asian food then. I barely saw any Asians in my life. Now I must admit, I've got a more refined taste for everything Asian. Tian tian has a line. On a Sunday afternoon at 3:55 PM. All tourists, I gathered. Anthony Bourdain was here. The lady in front of me was from London, Asian British lady. On her honeymoon. We chatted about this spot, and we each ordered a small plate. Holy cow, $3 USD basically. We ate happily with chili on the side (we made friends while standing in line). The location is called Maxwell Center or something with Maxwell in it. You need to walk away from Chinatown, passing by some super cool buildings that house Chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area. Excellent atmosphere. Exceptional chicken dish. I would definitely take friends and families there. Not that I have anyone who would visit me in Singapore. Not that I go to Singapore that often. But this chicken is growing on me. And this stall.","172":"Tian Tian does not make the same Hainanese chicken rice dish that your mom used to make (sorry Mom, it's true)! \u00c2\u00a0Actually, I cannot really say that my mom ever cooked this dish... but if she had, then it still would not have compared. \u00c2\u00a0Tian Tian's chicken rice dish truly lives up to the legend it has become!There are enough reviews detailing the deliciousness and tenderness of this dish, so I will provide you with a pro tip - the line here can get long quickly, so plan to stop in at an off-time (ya know, not during the typical lunch\/dinner rush times). \u00c2\u00a0I stopped in early on a Friday afternoon and walked right up and ordered - score! \u00c2\u00a0Shortly after I sat down to wait the brief wait for my order, the line grew ten-plus long in a snap.Tian Tian is definitely a must-try in Singapore!*****FIVE STARS*****","173":"I came here on my first day in Singapore and managed to skip any lines as it was about 10:45am. Score for no lines at a Michelin rated hawker stall!Went ahead and ordered their specialty Hainam chicken dish. I thought it was good and what snt it apart, was the gravy sauce! You can't find this sauce anywhere and it is probably what gives this place the 1 Michelin Star rating.After much thought, I think America has spoiled me in that theres so much options and similar to many of the famous hawker stall flavors here I in Singapore. I would defInitely recommend coming here to try the sauces Hainan Chicken if there's no ginormous line!","174":"During my recent trip to Singapore, I went on a mission to find the best chicken rice. Tian Tian, recommended by the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, was the first stop on my quest.Tian Tian is located at the Maxwell Food Centre, a short walk from Marina Bay. Don't be alarmed at the long line. It moves quickly!We ordered a medium chicken rice to share (but came back again the next day and ordered our own), which set us back 5 Singapore dollars ($3.69 USD). A total steal for lunch.What makes this place so special is that they do a simple dish really well:- the chicken is perfectly poached, soft & juicy- the rice is fragrant and tasty, not bland like at Hawker Chan- the chili sauce that comes with the dish is super tasty, there's chili, citrus (probably lime), a little bit of oil, a perfect topping for this chicken rice dish. I need to get the recipe for this chili sauce because I want to drizzle it on top of all my chicken rice meals.If you are in Singapore, you MUST visit Tian Tian.","175":"Okay, so its been 9 years since i have been here (yelp was not in singapore yet) but it is still my favorite hainan chicken rice ever! Braving the long lines can be problematic especially when tempted by so many food stalls at the Maxwell food market! Their chicken achieves that elusive perfect balance between cooked just enough to be tender but not too well done for the meat to be dry. \u00c2\u00a0Texture is spot on. Gingery sauce and spicy sauce is delicious. \u00c2\u00a0I miss this place still","176":"Born out of frugality and created by servant-class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken, chicken rice dishes are a staple to Singaporean cuisine. I did the chicken rice challenge between Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Liao Fan Hawker Chan. The ever-so-popular Michelin Guide praised one with a single star, and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain (RIP).In comparison, both prices were similar, and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours. The most significant difference between these two stands was their style. One was soy sauce based, while the other was a stock-based. If I had a vote between the two, purely based on my opinion, I would give my vote to this restaurant. I loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken. Served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity. Along with the meal, they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce, which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain. I loved this place for the price. Although it did not fill me up, it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day.","177":"My friends and I went to Singapore recently and planned our days around eating. Of course Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was on our list and luckily we went when there were only a few people in line! We ordered 2 large plates of Chicken and Rice and 1 plate of Beansprouts and Cuttlefish to share. The chicken was perfectly poached and tender and the chicken-stock rice was fragrant and flavorful, the dish was served with a citrus chili sauce which was unique and tasty. We lucked out with not having to wait but I've heard a wait of 45mins-60mins is standard, a must try if ever in Singapore.","178":"There's chicken rice and then there's Tian Tian's chicken rice. This is hands down the best chicken rice I've ever eaten. The rice is flavorful with a light black sauce and chicken juice gravy over it and the chicken is perfectly moist. It pairs really well with the lime based chili sauce that gives it just the right kick.The store does lots of takeout orders so you can order ahead if you want to skip the line. We got there just before the lunch rush on a weekday at 11.30am or so and ended up waiting 10 minutes. It's a well oiled machine but I'd expect a wait of around 15 to 20 minutes during peak times. On the bright side, you can easily spot the store by the long line!","179":"Never eaten so delicious Hainanese chicken with rice before. The chicken is tender and smooth and the rice is flavoured with ginger, scallion and oil. It tasted awesome!!Just to be prepared to come early to avoid long line up. Even so, there is a very good system of collecting money on one aide and have the dishes ready on the other side.","180":"Rated to be one of the top places to get Chicken rice in Singapore so I had to try it. This joint has 2 locations but I wanted to try the popular one that is located in the Maxwell food center.Located on the opposite side of Maxwell ave of the hawker center, you will put your order in and grab a ticket. You'll then hand the ticket to the other window and they will serve you your food. The line can queue up depending on the time, especially during the lunch hour. However I showed up a little before 11:30 on a Tuesday and there was no wait!Most popular is the medium chicken rice, which includes chicken the rice and the chili sauce all on a plate. Chicken was very moist and tender like what people said but the chili sauce is what makes it really good. I highly recommend that you give this place a try although it is not my personal favorite in Singapore","181":"Another Michelin-rated hawker meal. \u00c2\u00a0Another lineup and another great meal for only $5SG. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was smooth and rice was not oily and tastes good. \u00c2\u00a0You cannot beat the value\/taste proposition for sure. \u00c2\u00a0Is this a \"wow, out of this world meal\"? \u00c2\u00a0Not quite, but still worth a try if you are in the area..","182":"Got there 15 min before it closes. The line was not bad for Saturd night & they cranked out the orders very quickly. This place def knows how to handle the long queue which its fame has brought. \u00c2\u00a0We ordered 2 medium chicken rice $5 each) & 1 side of vege in oyster sauce $6). \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was solid, relatvely tender & not too dry, skins & bone attached. Most of the chicken were good cuts with minimal unwanted parts. \u00c2\u00a0When served it already has a layer of light sauce on it, but they also privode you with a side of spicy dipping sauce. Again I wish they have that Cantonese style dipping sauce that has more minced ginger & slightly saltier. \u00c2\u00a0The rice was also good, cooked in the chicken's own juice. \u00c2\u00a0The vege was pretty good as well, lightly flavored & still relatively crunchyOverall the place serves solid food, but I could barely distinguish it from the other good hainan chicken rice places.","183":"I can understand why this place is so popular (we showed up around 11 and there already was a line). The chicken was very tender and moist, though I'm confused by why there was no skin included. Rice was also well flavored, if a bit too soft for my taste. No aircon in the hawker center, so grab a coconut or soursop juice from one of the stalls across and you're good to go.","184":"I love coming to Singapore to visit family. \u00c2\u00a0First stop Tian, Tian hawker stall. \u00c2\u00a0Hawker stalls are the place to eat for some great food in Singapore. \u00c2\u00a0Chicken and rice are pretty much a staple in Singapore so its easy to find.The food here is sooooo amazing and delicious! Simple cuisine big flavor and so filling. \u00c2\u00a0Good service. \u00c2\u00a0Then you grab a seat and chow down.","185":"There was a line and they were prepared with lanes set up. It moved pretty quickly though. I think the other famous spot was closed so this one was extra busy. I ordered the thigh and greens on the side. The hardest was finding a spot to sit to eat. The chicken was top notch. Flavorful and super juicy and soft. The pepper was great...I asked for 2. Lol! I went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left. They discounted to $5 each. I took 2. Even the breast was super moist. I wish I could eat this every day!","186":"I was building this up in my head so much, that I was sure I was going to disappointed. Such a cheap Michelin star restaurant - there's gotta be a catch right?Not with Tian Tian.We had to wait in line for about 10 mins. Compared to the Bay area, where it takes 10 mins to just find you a table, this was a breeze. The plates & bowls on which they actually served the chicken & soup, while not perfectly clean, was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers. Hey, that's how it goes, right?Now, the actual food. The rice, was something you can eat just by itself. It was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world. And it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken. The soup just tied it all together.I was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones?! I was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience. But overall, for that price and quality, a must go. But don't wait in line too long though. The other chicken rice places in the same hawker center and not bad at all.","187":"The chicken here is sooo tender and at the same time it's flavourful. The rice that comes with is chicken oil rice, and just like what Antony Bourdain says: it's so good you can eat it itself. We enjoyed this place so much that we came back for a second meal the same day and totally don't regret doing it. The chili lime sauce that comes as a dip, taste delicious too, but beware it can be a bit spicy. It gives the chicken a bit of kick and a twist. It almost taste like a Thai lime sauce. The boiled bak choy comes with a fried shallot sauce, which just makes everything taste better. The squid with bean sprouts came with a Thai sauce and chili but it was not spicy at all. I suggest adding a bit of the chicken dip sauce if you would like a kick.","188":"Great hainan chicken and luckily we didn't have much of a wait! Chicken was moist and rice was flavorful. A little more expensive than other options: 5 per chicken rice (medium size).","189":"Thanks Yelp for directing me to this restaurant as my very first meal in Singapore ever!I wasn't convinced that this place warranted the reviews when I saw a couple patsy white ribs in some clear-ish broth. How could anything be delicious when it looked boiled with no seasonings? Nope nope nope! I stand corrected! I can admit I was very wrong. The meat was unlike any other ribs I have ever had and the broth is just an extra bonus. How something so unassuming and simple can be so good I can not pretend to even know, but my socks were completely knocked off. Can soup make a grown woman cry? Yes, yes it can. The ambiance and service is simple, the price is low and the product is amazing. Will I fly back to Singapore for ribs in soup...? I just might...","190":"Best Bak Kut Teh (Pork-Rib Soup) in Singapore! \u00c2\u00a0Too many good food in Singapore, and it's hard to say which one is the best. However, if you ask for Bak Kut Teh recommendation, I gotta say @songfamedan is the best among all! I'm so impressed by the tenderness of the pork ribs, which they even show you the level of tenderness of each pork-rib soup on their menu. No wonder they are listed under the Michelin Bib Gourmand!  Pro tip: Don't worry about you'll finish the soup quickly, as they have unlimited refills","191":"Currently back in the states and I'm regretting not bringing back Song Fa's bak kut teh spice packets.Fair warning, the soup is verrrry peppery. I personally enjoy the kick, but I can see how it can be too much for some. Other than that, the broth is sooo warming. I enjoyed it in 90 degree heat, so I can't imagine how good it is when it's cold (does it even get cold in Singapore...?) The pork rib is tender and meaty- I loved biting it off the bone!Best part is that the soup is unlimited!!! Once they see that you're running low, a server comes to refill your bowl. Don't be discouraged if you see a line outside, as it moves super quickly!","192":"I get the hype... \u00c2\u00a0It's one of the most consistent places in terms of both food quality and service even though the food is fairly simple. \u00c2\u00a0I find myself coming here pretty much once a week on the weekends to get my fix.The broth is definitely the highlight for me. \u00c2\u00a0It's peppery but there's no sharp heat. \u00c2\u00a0It's so comforting that I usually get at least 2~3 refills. \u00c2\u00a0The meat is pretty tender, but the broth is really the star. \u00c2\u00a0I personally get the large size because I don't get rice or noodle, but I think most people will be fine withe regular size. \u00c2\u00a0The other items are pretty decent as well, but I always stick to the Bak Kut Teh as the primary focus.The only down side is the line\/queue... \u00c2\u00a0They do make the wait time more productive by taking order first.","193":"This soup wasn't bad, just not my favorite. It's a peppery porky broth, but the soup and pork ribs were little bland by my standards. It's nice that they refill the broth though! I didn't really get the hype around this, but maybe i'm just not used to Singaporean cuisine.get the lemon iced tea- really refreshing!","194":"I would come here and just get the pork soup. We got the normal one large ( 4 pieces vs 3 pieces for rib).You get unlimited broth! So we just got one large bowl with about 4 refills. Omg so good. So peppery. Keep in mind I haven't been to other ones, but I loved how homey and cheap it was. The other items we got were pork trotters, chicken feet, lightly fried chicken rolls. None of those really stuck out tbh, I'd stick to just the soup. They weren't bad by any means, just nothing could match the soup. Some soup, a little bit of rice, and I think you are set.We also got the soursop drink, and I really thought the fruit worked well","195":"Damn, this place is the place to come for dinner. We had: veggies, beancurd skin, pork belly, premium loin ribs soup, and rice.The premium loin ribs soup was very very tasty. The soup was very well made and with lots of punch.The flavor was on the spot. I addition, the ribs were very tasty up to the bone.The punch of the night was the pork belly. It had the proper combination of fat and skinny meat. The sauce made the dish even more tastier. I gotta warn that this place gets pretty crowded and the wait line can take up to 1hr or more. So, be prepared for such long line and long wait time.","196":"So so simple but so so good, and love that it opens at 9 am so my friends and I could get a breakfast in.Ordered the pork rib soup (which is what they're known for, especially if it's in the name of the restaurant) and they constantly refill the soup which is nice. It tastes heavily of white pepper but I love it, and the pork is so tender it falls off the bone. Definitely one of those restoring and revitalizing feeling soups.Also got the braised pork belly which was good, but if you're sticking to a smaller breakfast, just go for the bak kut teh Would definitely come back for another","197":"Oh my oh my do not judge a book by its cover ! Their pork rib soup may look simple, but i like to think it has magical powers!! The peppery and warm broth hits your throat like no other. It really warms up your body and makes you feel so good. The soup is sweet and peppery, but never too overpowering. Not to mention, the pork ribs are so damn tender. So easy to bite off and doesn't have a weird meaty taste. Just so damn perfect. I think this dish is pretty healthy ??? I had a sore throat the day I tried this dish and it completely healed itself the next day! What a magical soup this is.","198":"Go a little late to avoid long lines during meal hours. They have the best Bak Kut Teh (pork rib soup) ever! Their broth is amazing and they come and refill your bowl if you are low. They also have other good vegetable and meat dishes but their pork rib soup is the best!They charge for green tea and refill it only once for free.Super delicious, clean, and air conditioning!","199":"One of the best BKT restaurants around. \u00c2\u00a0Song Fa is famous (and old) , though I don't think they would be the \"original\" as there are variations of who made the first BKTs Hokkien style or the more herbal version. I would definitely recommend getting the pickled mustard greens to pair with the savory-ness of BKT. \u00c2\u00a0Also, they come around and refill the broth, which is the best part!","200":"Very cozy feeling when you walk into the store. Definitely recommend trying their items on the menu with the stars. I got the traditional Pork Bak Kuh Teh and I absolutely loved it. I'm usually not the type to order soup when I go out to eat because I'm scared it won't be flavorable. However, Song FA definitely is a Michelin Star worthy restaurant. It was so delicious that we bought their packed soup base to bring back home to make.","201":"The soup here was delicious! And the staff is friendly and helpful as well.I ordered the Ba Ku Teh, which at about $7 comes with 3 pork bones and soup. But as you are eating the bones and the soup, they come around and refill your bowl with more soup! The big benefit of that is that the soup always tastes super hot, because there's only so much soup at any given time, and every time you get more, the soup pipping hot, which keeps the experience super enjoyable.The broth has a rich tasty pork taste, with a bit of pepper in it. It was a hearty, warm loving soup and I personally liked the amount of pepper, I thought it balanced the soup really well.The Cai Lan was also pretty good, as well as the Lemon Tea. Overall a super enjoyable experience and one of my favorite meals in Singapore.","202":"Went to Singapore to visit a friend and this place was recommended to me. This place has a couple locations around SG but I was advised to go to this one.I ordered the one and only bak kut teh for breakfast. The pork ribs were soft and fall off the bone, the broth soup is pepper but light. They also refill your broth\/soup for free. It's really good with rice. Definitely will go back here when I visit Singapore again.","203":"This is my MUST eat everytime I visit Singapore, which is once or twice a year. \u00c2\u00a0There are several locations but I believe New Bridge Road restaurant is the original and in my opinion, the best. \u00c2\u00a0The ribs soup is super flavorful and is to perfection! \u00c2\u00a0Everything else on the menu is yummy, anything you get...you will enjoy. \u00c2\u00a0The only con to this location is no air conditioning. \u00c2\u00a0If you can bare the heat and humidity, I recommend this Song Fa location and definitely recommend Bak Kut Teh restaurant!!","204":"I've only had Malaysian version of pork rib soup prior. I had no idea Singaporean version was so peppery! Unlimited refills on broth - we ordered their pork ribs, loins, premium ribs, liver, kidney - every cut was perfectly prepared and extremely tender. Dipped in a bit of house made \u00c2\u00a0chili, beyond delish! Soy braised pig trotters, pork belly, and pig intestines - My fav was the melt in my mouth, super cooked down collagen from the trotters. The braising sauce was so tasty. Spoonful over rice, you got yourself \u00c2\u00a0a perfect meal! Limited seatings but they are very efficient in getting tables ready. Also they begin taking your order as you stand in line. So foods are served as soon as you are seated! Def check out Song Fa when In SG!","205":"If you like peppery (as opposed to herbal) bak kut teh, this is one of the best places in town. Popular with Asian tourists, who come by bus loads to savour this delicacy. In addition to the signature pork ribs, they also have pork kidney, large and small pork intestines, chicken feet, tofu skin, pork belly. The wait can be up to an hour, in spite of them having two outlets almost next door to each other. Occasionally, you see a hardcore Caucasian customer (more typically adventurous backpacker types rather than conservative bankers of lawyers), but rarely South Asian ones and almost never Middle Eastern ones.","206":"Tea based ribs soup is the specialty here and it's deliciously soaked in the savory broth. You'll get one refill of the tea throughout the meal. The appetizer combo is a good deal if you want to try out the different snacks - but those can be skipped if you just go for the ribs. Now what isn't fun is if there's a wait - there's no A\/C here as everything is open air (pretty much like a hawker center). Best to dine and go quickly.","207":"Work lunch Singapore style. Pork rib broth - endless broth, 2 pieces of super tender pork ribs. Peppery, white peppery broth. Needless to say, I want more. I had three bowls. Side dishes are bit salty. It also came with a bowl of rice.It's stereotypical Singaporean. Small dishes and lots of soup.I'm not complaining but the broth soup thing must be lost on westerners who did not grow up with soup.The soup is almost white in color and they refill it from a kettle made for tea. Thus, the name translates into meat bone tea. However, this thick broth is exactly the kind of thing Asians grew up on, especially southern (Cantonese) Chinese. I would love to come back, but knowing my immediate family, which I put them under the white people category, this is not something they'd be up for. \u00c2\u00a0So save this meal trip with fellow soup aficionados!","208":"Such comfort food and it's always so delicious, I always visit this place when I'm back in Singapore. Very reasonable price and very filling","209":"Although this place is overhyped, I was not expecting much, so my experience was neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. Fortunately, there wasn't a long line when I came, so I got my meal almost immediately after ordering up front. I ordered the cha siew & chicken with rice and it KIND OF tasted like what I've already had before. The cha siew and chicken were cooked well, the chicken was tender, and the soy sauce was SWEEEET, so it's a bit different than what I've had; I think honey might be in the marinade recipe. I prefer the cha siew over the chicken because the flavoring was bomb, but the entire meal was very satisfying for me. The reviews here are mixed but I actually enjoy and appreciate simple + affordable foods and that's exactly what Chef Chan's belief is. I'm pretty glad a non-expensive nor fancy fine-dining restaurant like simple Hawker Chan received a Michelin star. It's worth checking out and I don't know why you wouldn't want to spend less than USD$3 for a meal, because honestly, what can that get you especially in America? NOTHING. I personally RECOMMEND!","210":"On my trip to Singapore I was determined to have the famous \"cheapest Michelin star meal\". I wasn't able to locate the original stall in the hawker market until after they sold out, but came to their chain storefront instead to have the faux experience.The chicken itself was fantastic, and extremely flavorful. I could eat that stuff for days.But, the experience overall felt a little bit like they turned the original Hawker Chan into a McDonalds. It's commercial and the food, though tasty, came out a bit cold.I'm still extremely happy I was able to eat here-- because it was extremely tasty-- but the commercialization is a little bit disappointing to me.","211":"Probably one of the cheapest Michelin star meal you can find for $5! Went around lunch time and the place was PACKED...we waited in line for at least half an hr. Trying to find a table? Don't. We ordered the soya chicken with rice, roasted pork with rice, and soy sauce vegetables. As a Cantonese I pretty much grew up eating roasted meats and chicken and I have to say the food quality was underwhelming. The chicken wasn't really tender and actually somewhat dry. Same thing goes with the roasted pork: there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat isn't too dry. You can't beat the price of $5 but honestly there are so many hawkers in Singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options.The seating\/lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space. It was an interesting experience given the chain's fame but honestly I wouldn't be back.","212":"Hawker Chan was my second stop on my quest to find the best chicken rice in Singapore, and I was massively disappointed.We ordered a soya chicken rice, their specialty, and while the chicken was nicely cooked the rice was bland and the sauce did nothing to help the dish. \"Just okay\" is the best description I can provide for how the dish tasted overall. For the cheapest Michelin star meal in the world, I was disappointed. There are so many other things I would rather eat for the same amount of money (around $5 singapore dollars).Not worth the trek.","213":"It's everything I was promised! Probably one of the best meals I've ever had especially when it comes down to about $5 U.S. a meal.- Soya sauce chicken w\/ rice - this must be the tastiest chicken I've ever had, especially their skin. Whatever they marinated would definitely has a Touch of Magic. \u00c2\u00a0Only complaint is that they do it the inexpensive way which is just directly butcher the chicken so you have a lot of Bones to go through 4\/5- char siew hor fun - incredibly flavorful. Hard to be disappointed with such an explosion of flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection - aiyu aloe vera - super super refreshing. The jelly tastes like chrysanthemum with chunks of aloe. I highly recommend getting this with any of their dishes. I think it's the perfect palate cleanser at the end of extremely hearty flavorsAlthough I only have a few days out here, definitely going to make a second stop before I leave. A must & absolutely worth it","214":"The famous hawker chanI was in Singapore and had to stop by I heard they had a Michelin star. I got super lucky when I came in the line was small I waited about 10 minutes to order and got my food 5 minutes after that. I ordered the soya chicken and rice the Michelin star dish, I got it to go because although the line was short the place was packed.The food!!!So to start it had alot of bones, the chicken was cooked well, not dry at all, the flavor was very generic, I tasted the soya sauce and it wasn't anything impressive. I was left a little disappointed, I may have set my expectations too high. Overall it's ok, just ok there's other hawkers some tasting better in my opinion.","215":"Simple food. Expect a line.Have you ever eaten at a Michelin-starred spot for $5? Not only is Singapore a dope vacation destination, but it has cheap, delicious food. With numerous and cheap Michelin-starred restaurants. It's cool that this restaurant is in Chinatown, so you can shop and continue your food journey while in Singapore.After waiting in the line that was literally out the door (roughly 20 minutes), I ordered the soya chicken and rice, which is what gave this place its Michelin star. \u00c2\u00a0When I finally received my food (about 10 minutes later), I struggled for a few minutes finding a table. \u00c2\u00a0This place is packed! Seriously, good luck finding a seat, as people tend to \"save\" them for their multiple person families. Kinda rude, but smart. I will say that the chicken was good, but not very unique and definitely not worth the wait. It was roasted chicken, rice with soya sauce, half a boiled egg, fresh slices of cucumber, and roasted peanuts. Super random items and plating, but I suppose when they are churning out hundreds-plus plates a day they could care less. There are tons of other hawkers that serve the same food and you'll get it in 5 minutes without a wait.Suggestions: \u00c2\u00a0Take your food to go and go sit on a bench or in the food court nearby to eat it. \u00c2\u00a0It'll save you time and energy from wrestling for seats with other foreigners. Or, if you just want to try the dish, go to any hawker stall.","216":"Located on a busy street in Chinatown it is easy to pass right by the unassuming, Michelin star owning, Liao Fan Hawker Chan.Due to the notoriety, we were warned that the line may be long (multiple hours), luckily we went at an off time and therefore did not have it wait. We walked right up to the counter and ordered the famous, chicken and rice. Compared to other dishes we had in the area I found the simplicity of the dish surprising. While the flavors were very subtly the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. I don't think I would wait hours to get the dish again especially since it is a common local dish, but if you've never been and want to experience the \"The Cheapest Michelin-starred Meal In The Word\" I would suggest stopping by.","217":"I had just gone to Maxwell Hawker Center at 10 am to try the Hainan Chicken Rice at Tian Tian, then decided to walk through Chinatown to try the Soya Sauce Chicken at Hawker Chan. \u00c2\u00a0It was a short walk, but I stopped several times to buy souvenirs. \u00c2\u00a0I got to Hawker Chan around 10:45 am, and there were about 6 people waiting in line. \u00c2\u00a0It was early and the restaurant was fairly empty, and the line moved quickly.I had to try their famous soya sauce chicken that won them their Michelin star, and boy was it good! \u00c2\u00a0The skin reminded me of the skin from a roast chicken or duck. \u00c2\u00a0It's better than most of the soya sauce chickens I've had in San Francisco. \u00c2\u00a0The sauce is a mix between savory and sweet. \u00c2\u00a0I feel that most of the soya sauce chickens at home were mostly salty, and one dimensional. \u00c2\u00a0The Hawker Chan chicken was moist and juicy. \u00c2\u00a0Portion size is on the smaller side, but I wasn't too hungry after already eating at Tian Tian about an hour earlier.I also ordered the green papaya with pork ribs soup, fried dumplings, and a Chinese flower tea. \u00c2\u00a0My entire meal came out to $18.80 SGD. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was only $5 SGD (about $3.67 USD in November 2019). \u00c2\u00a0It's insane. \u00c2\u00a0There is no way I could get a chicken rice plate for under $4 in San Francisco, much less at a Michelin star restaurant.Definitely a must-try if you're in Singapore.","218":"I don't know. I didn't get the hype. Chicken rice is extremely bland. I did tons of research prior to our trip to Singapore and this is THE DISH to try but it just did nothing for me. The restaurant is extremely crowded (surely due to the Michelin Star) and you have to stalk a table to sit down. Food is prepared quickly but generally you will need to share a table with a stranger and have someone standing over you waiting for you to finish. It's not worth the hassle in my opinion. It's located on the bustling food street in Chinatown and there are tons of other \u00c2\u00a0options.","219":"\"The Cheapest Meal At A Michelin-starred Street Food Stall\". Anytime I get to try something that's both Michelin and cheap, than I do it! \u00c2\u00a0I ordered the signature dish (the Soya Sauce Chicken), which cost 3.68 USD for the entire set. It does not get much cheaper than that.The meal was delicious! I ordered a second dish to eat because it was so tasty. The hor fun noodles and char siew was a great choice as well. I actually preferred the noodles compared to rice after tasting both.Be prepared to wait for a little while because this place is very popular. It can crowded, but I think they did a great job of serving as many people as possible.The Recommendation: This place definitely lives up to its reputation. Come here for a cheap Michelin meal and discover for yourself what the hype is all about!","220":"Located right by the Chinatown MRT! My bf and I came around 1:30pm after stopping by the Maxwell Hawker Centre. It's only about a 10 minute walk through Chinatown. There was no line, but a decent amount of people eating inside. Our order came out very quickly! Free wifi, a\/c and toilets!Soya Sauce Chicken Rice: For a Michelin Star, Liao Fan Hawker Chan killed it! The chicken was very juicy and tender. The skin tasted almost like roasted duck skin. Sauce on top takes the cake for flavor! Overall this place is worth the hype and the price!","221":"I'm the world's most impatient person. The only time I'm willing to wait on a long line is for good food. Call me a hardcore Yelper...whenever I travel overseas, I seek out Michelin starred eateries. This one has been on my radar for the longest time. It's just some Soya chicken in a window, like what you normally see in every Chinatown restaurant around the world. What makes these extra special? I was about to find out. We decided to come here for an early lunch. A long line was forming quickly and I realized the limited amount of available seating. The smart thing to do is stake your claim at one of the tables. Place your shopping bag, purse, umbrella or anything to hold that seat. Singapore is that safe, no one will take take\/steal your stuff. Get on line and check out the menu before you order. My Yelper friend, Jessalyn P., (who came here two months before me) agree that it was our favorite meal while we were in Singapore. The shocking part, it was also the cheapest at $3.50 U.S. The portions are small. Kinda wished that we ordered more side meat dishes along with our meal. Get the veggies, it's simple yet one of the best I've ever had. I'm going to say that the biggest difference I taste in this chicken is the soy sauce they use. I think that's their secret. They pour it onto your rice too, so flavorful. The chicken itself is tender as can be, not one dry piece. I'm still dreaming about it. All of our eyes widen at first bite with a look of...OMG, it's so damn good.People will be hovering over you waiting for you to finish so they can take your seating. This is not a place to linger and chat. Be courteous, eat and leave.A must visit and worth waiting in line for.","222":"The much coveted Michelin star meal- -Soya Sauce Chicken at Liao Fan Hawker Chan is incredibly delicious! This famous chicken and rice dish in Singapore is causing a stir. In hindsight, I wished I dined there more than once during my trip. The menu is limited but, everything is done exceptionally well! It features chicken and pork served with your choice of either rice or noodles. The soya sauce chicken is tender with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully fragrant sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The char siew pork was nicely charred with a delightful caramelization on the outside. A great side dish! While they don't focus on presentations, the tastes are exemplary! Expect a wait for this critically acclaimed dish but, it's definitely worth it!","223":"Chicken is so soft and mushy. Sauce is so sweet and dimensionless. Best part of the meal was the rice noodles (good texture) and papaya soup.","224":"Finally after a few years of being selected as Michelin Star restaurant, I got to try their famous chicken rice.I arrived here 30 minutes before their opening time but a long queue was already there when I arrived. They got really busy within one hour of opening and people came with large group couldn't sit together.My experience on the day I visited was underwhelming. I kept thinking why am I paying $5 for this? It used to be $3 when I tried five years ago. Food now is not as good as it used to be... why did I stand in line so long for this food?Tourists from all over the world came here to experience. It could be a personal preference, I prefer another chicken rice from somewhere else.","225":"Decided to try out Hawker Chan on a short trip to Singapore. Had the soya sauce chicken rice, the roast pork and the char siew. Aside from the char siew, everything else especially the chicken rice was subpar and overrated. I've had way better chicken rice in Malaysia at various hawker stalls. The chaw siew was the saving grace, but there are much better options in Malaysia as well. Really disappointed but at least there wasn't a long wait for the food.","226":"I heard about this coveted Michelin star meal- -Soya Sauce Chicken at Liao Fan Hawker Chan for a long time and had to give it a try. In case you don't know, Singaporean's consider this dish to be a National Dish. You definitely need to try it while in Singapore and why not go to the best?There are several locations and while this is not the original, I am almost certain that this is just as good. We didn't know that there was more than one location and we just put the name in Grab. The driver informed us that this place is really great. You can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs Chinatown. However, it was 90 degrees outside and thought this was just fine. We wanted to beat the rush and arrived about 10:50am. There were about 10 people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly.The menu is pretty basic, you'll pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles. I went with their famous chicken and rice. The soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier. An order of this dish sets you back about $3.50USD which is absolutely crazy talk. I don't know how they keep it so inexpensive. This is a must visit...but if you want to keep it authentic, head for Chinatown (although I am sure they taste the same).","227":"I mistakenly arrived at this location shortly after 10 a.m. and was surprised to see how beautiful, new, and not crowded this location was. It turns out that this is not the original location. It is built for tourists and serving Coca-Cola in an air conditioning environment ready to accommodate dozens of tourists.I inquired with the order taker whether or not this was the original location \u00c2\u00a0and I found out that the original location is located just across the street and up an escalator, newest store, and then to the left. So, in conclusion, buyer beware as always. In this case, this beautiful looking restaurant is not the original one.","228":"Okay so now that I've actually visited - - it's pretty good but I don't see why it has a Michellin star \u00c2\u00a0Prices are pretty good. It tastes pretty good but the white meat can be a bit dry. \u00c2\u00a0Aiyu jelly is surprisingly good.","229":"Just wanted to comment that N C has no idea what he is talking about. \u00c2\u00a0His review here: yelp.com\/biz\/liao-fan-ho\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.He's just another ignorant white person who can't grasp the idea that the skin, fat, and bone are where all the flavor is. \u00c2\u00a0He's the kind of guy who orders white meat at chicken places.","230":"Clean, safe for stomach, Michelin star restaurant with the prices of the foodcourt. All DTFs I visited in Singapore were great.","231":"This is my third Din Tai Fung. But I like this one. You know immediately they do a good job on their special dumplings - Xiao Long Bao. The restaurant is at orchard road. Most of the wait time is about 20 minutes. I waited only 17 minutes. As usual, I order the crab Xiao Long Bao. It is soupy and crab egg in it. Very good. The soup here is better than my previous two other locations. I got the shrimp dumplings. It is half moon shape. The only thing I would said is good. Finally I have try one of their specialty. The black truffle Xiao Long Bao. It is rare item. Each piece cost $5 SG. The make of this dumplings is with black truffle. It doe carry plenty soup it it. It has great taste. The food come out quick. Service to the table is attentive. I would said is a way to move the customer to create space for the people who waited.","232":"When you're used to 2-3 hour waits in Los Angeles to eat here and pay much higher prices, it is like heaven eating here in Singapore where you can just walk in, sit down and eat.I can report that 4F here at the Wisma Atria Shopping Center felt to me as if I were in Foodie heaven. \u00c2\u00a0So many choices and in the middle of this chaos of food teasing is Din Tai Fung.We sat down and were promptly served two orders of Xiao Long Bao and felt pacified as the soup explosion in my mouth placed me in a state foodie hypnosis.And that was just the regular order. \u00c2\u00a0We then order the one with truffle flavoring and I felt like Buddha must felt when he found himself in reclining position as he attained Nirvana.Seriously, I really enjoyed the quality here and feel as if I have cheated the entire state of California whole will wait another 2 hours before they can sit down and have about 70% of the quality of XLB that are here.We also had the drunken chicken: simple and excellent.Then for a refreshment, I had the grass jelly drink. \u00c2\u00a0Perfect.Then we had a mushroom and minced pork with noodle dish. \u00c2\u00a0Simple and perfect.All in all, Singapore, when it comes to food is like placing money on bets you will never lose.That's what happened here tonight. \u00c2\u00a0This foodie is one happy man.","233":"Still awesome xiao long bao and fried wontons. \u00c2\u00a0I had the crab xiao long bao and seafood pork fried wontons, very good taste.","234":"Good dim sum, chili crab bao was delicious and so were the xiao long bao and shrimp xiu mai. \u00c2\u00a0Taste is similar to Guangzhou's and Hong Kong's dim sum restaurants. Drinks a little expensive, especially fruit juices.","235":"I am a big fan of DTF and have been to many locations in the USA and Taiwan. \u00c2\u00a0Even went to the original so when we had this opportunity, we jumped at it. After we arrived, we were seated right away. \u00c2\u00a0We ordered items we usually order and the first item the Cucumber Appetizer, it was served cut lengthwise, and had an odd sauce and odd taste. \u00c2\u00a0The food in general was just OK and the service was slow and inattentive. \u00c2\u00a0Left the restaurant disappointed which never happens. \u00c2\u00a0If this had been my first experience i would most likely never go back.","236":"I LOVE DIN TAI FUNG!!! I live for their soup dumplings! I've officially been to their Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, Hong Kong and Shanghai locations now -- can't wait to conquer more locations!DTF has a good selection of dishes, soup dumplings are excellent! Cucumber with chilli sauce dish is very refreshing. Pork Wontons is a new dish I tried while in Hong Kong and now i'm going to get it every time!","237":"How can everything here be so delicious? I think I had dim sum approximately four times during my one-week trip to Singapore and this was definitely the best of all of them. We didn't have to wait too long to get seated, and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down. I honestly don't remember everything we had; I just ate and felt happy. There were a couple highlights though:- Xiaolongbao: delicious. I've often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all. Not the case here. Full of soup, perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar.- Truffle xiaolongbao: If you like super strong truffle flavor, you could probably eat many of these. I could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb I've ever had. - Chili crab bun: What's not to love? Chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun...heavenly. - Fried rice: I could have eaten the whole plate. Enough said. - Chocolate\/red bean dumpling: I have never tried a dessert dumpling before, and I was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling. But it was delicious. The flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty. Be sure to save room for this. Din Tai Fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype.","238":"This Din Tai Fung is located on the 4th floor next to Japan Food Town. Was there on a Saturday for late lunch. The staff at the entrance gave me a number and a paper & pen so I could check what I liked to order while waiting. The wait was not bad at all. Good thing I did not have to stand in line. Think I ever mentioned in my other post, I do not like to stand in line, period! Staffs were all friendly and attentive. I like that the restaurant has those bag holders\/stands, like those in Taste Paradise, which allow female customers to store their purses or bags. Of cos those at Taste Paradise were a lot better since they came with a flap attached to secure the top. The ones at Din Tai Feng were open bag holders which the staff would just put a cloth over it. Ok I know, I can be so nitpicking.FOOD 4\/5The legendary xiao long bao (steamed dumplings) were yummy as expected. I also ordered one red bean bun and one meat bun just to try. They were tiny but were good.AMBIENCE 3\/5It was noisy but I did not expect it to be calm and quiet. It was not a place I would suggest for a first date. More like a place for friends to catch up or family lunch.STAFFS 5\/5Staffs were attentive, helpful and polite. Water was filled up constantly.","239":"First things first: don't be alarmed when your party's food does not arrive at the same time. The plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen. You'll see this throughout Singapore. Another thing: Pay your bill on the way out of the restaurant. Waitstaff don't have access to cash registers. Now onto the good stuff.... Do not judge this restaurant for being nestled in a mall. This is not food court food. It is a fun dining experience with delicious options for most diets (vegan options are not available). Order up and share with your table for the best experience!What we Shared:Dumplings: Vegetable & Pork, Chicken, Vegetarian, Shrimp & Pork Shao MaiThe dumplings were delicious and being able to share with the rest of my group made for a really enjoyable dining experience. I rounded out my meal with the egg fried rice (pretty standard) and the Red Bean XiaoLongBao for dessert (try this try this try this).","240":"Try the Dragon Boat dumplings and tea, especially the savory version, very nice. This time I also bought their own Chilli oil and Chilli sauce to use at home, hubby likes it a lot","241":"We are from the US and it seemed odd going to a food court to eat, but this place was great. Fast service and a nice view onto the street. The steamed buns were good and the spicey cucumber.","242":"Our favorite dumpling restaurant!!!! Always fresh, always delicious. If you can find a location for Din Tai Fung near you I highly recommend visiting. It's also very family friendly for young kids.","243":"Food is so evarage. Very few options and low quality of food. The crab soup dumplings is stink, which is very unacceptable. Nothing special.","244":"Was in Singapore last week and went to the DTF on Orchard Road. It was so good that I went back a second time. On Monday evening there was no wait for a table. On Friday we waited 20 minutes. I've been at three of these places in 3 different countries (Taiwan, USA and Singapore) and all were terrific.","245":"Just OKDefinitely overpriced for the quality and quantity. \u00c2\u00a0Want tap water? \u00c2\u00a0Be ready to fork out 50-cents! \u00c2\u00a0Not the money just ridiculous to charge for tap water! \u00c2\u00a0Food was nothing special. \u00c2\u00a0Wished we had eaten at the hawker stands in front of this restaurant instead of here. \u00c2\u00a0Would have been cheaper and probably better.","246":"Couldn't decide what to eat, and stumbled on DTF. \u00c2\u00a0I've had such high expectations for their soup dumplings that when they came out, I was a little disappointed. \u00c2\u00a0Not to say they weren't good or anything, because they were but just overly hyped. \u00c2\u00a0The dumplings are small and succulent. \u00c2\u00a0The drunken chicken was moist and full of alcohol. I don't think it's a 5 star restaurant but it's good.","247":"Andrew and I always wondered how Din Tai Fung (DTF) can consistently keep their rich flavour after opening many branches around the world. We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control. At the same time we also thought that we were just lucky... ;-)Two things that we always ordered in Din Tai Fung were their shrimp & pork shao mai and of course the 18 folds original Xiao Long Bao. DTF's xiao long bao is really in the league of their own. Honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although I never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling.The shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside. I always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as I love the additional sour flavour on the meat. Of course the price of their dishes are more than the other Chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us.","248":"A great place for dim sum for a gathering with a few family and friends (2-4). \u00c2\u00a0Looks really nice from outside until you get closer to the kitchen. \u00c2\u00a0Seems a bit dis-organized but they do get your orders asap. \u00c2\u00a0Nothing unique about their dishes that stood out but I had not tried everything. \u00c2\u00a0A bit pricey for dimsum in Singapore.","249":"I had my first xlb experience in August when I waited over 90 minutes to eat at Din Tai Fung in Seattle. \u00c2\u00a0It was well worth the wait and when I found out that there are locations all over Singapore, I had to make a visit. \u00c2\u00a0This location is located on the top floor of the Wisma Atria which was super easy to get to from the Grand Hyatt where we were staying. \u00c2\u00a0I was delighted when we didn't have to wait at all and were seated immediately. \u00c2\u00a0They even set a carrier next to our table for all of our packages from shopping. \u00c2\u00a0I liked that a lot!I ordered the braised beef noodles and pork xlb which was what I had ordered in Seattle. \u00c2\u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00c2\u00a0I love that the xlb is consistent and still amazing no matter where you go to in the world. \u00c2\u00a0I did notice that the braised beef in my noodles was a lot more fatty that the meat pieces in Seattle. \u00c2\u00a0Perhaps it's the geographical preference.Another thing I noticed was my friend and I were practically the only Asian people in the restaurants making me think there are probably many xlb restaurants that give DTF a run for their money. \u00c2\u00a0But no matter, love the xlb here and had a great lunch.","250":"First of all the wait wasn't too long and then the service is just incredible here! Never a minute where my water wasn't being refilled. NOW to talk about the food! Absolutely best soup dumplings I've ever had in my life. And SOOOO much food for a very reasonable price. Came hungry, left full and happy! My favorite menu items were Xiao Li Bing and the oriental vinegar salad. Only thing I'd steal clear from here is the pickled mustard with meat! Otherwise superb food, service, and atmosphere. Planning to come back again before we leave Singapore","251":"This is the prefect place for some late night dumplings. It's almost 3am in Singapore and I was so hungry. \u00c2\u00a0I guess hanging out with friends will do that. It doesn't hurt to soak up and beer either. This place is quick. Not the best dumplings I've had but the service is good and there are pretty tasty. I love pork so I always get that with a side of veggies. \u00c2\u00a0 Depending on the time of morning since that's when I come it cane be a bit busy with people eating but tonight (morning) wasn't too bad.","252":"I saw great reviews about this dim sum restaurant so I decided to give them a try. However, it was over rated. We got there early so we didn't have to queue in line. It was great, we were seated right after they opened at 1100. I was impressed that this place was pretty tech savvy for a dim sum restaurant. We scanned a QR code to order on the smartphone. Typically, I'm used to picking my dim sum from a cart or ordering on a piece of paper.I'm giving them three stars because none of our dishes came out hot. \u00c2\u00a0All of the food that came out was either warm or cold (again, the dishes should have been hot). I was pretty disappointed.","253":"I had a mouthgasm from eating here. Everything was so good! Tips: Bring cash cause they don't accept credit cards. Also, they're closed on Tuesday.","254":"Very popular dim sum place. They have three stores next to each other which they open based on demand. We arrived right after 11 am when they were opening and had no trouble finding a spot to sit. We ordered an array of dim sum plates which were good and pretty standard but tasty and some jasmine tea to go along with it. My favorites were \u00c2\u00a0the dumplings and the buns although I have no idea \u00c2\u00a0what they were filled with, we just ordered based on the pictures on the menu, which was really helpful. \u00c2\u00a0The spicy items are really spice, \u00c2\u00a0so be careful when ordering!No frills cheap fast food.","255":"One of my favorite late night eats when I'm in Singapore.Expect a long wait -- although they've expanded to encompass three different rooms now. One of my favorites is their unique Mee sua kueh which is a pan fried mee sua noodle that looks like carrot\/turnip cake. I like to drizzle the spicy wanton sauce on it before eating. Yum! Service isn't the best, but then again you come for the good food and not 5 star service treatment.","256":"Beancurd roll - 3.5 starsBit too salty. Pretty sure there's prawn or meat inside...Fried pumpkin with custard - 4 starsIt's \u00e6\u00b5\u0081\u00e6\u00b2\u0099 inside. Not sure how I feel about it but the texture was great.Passion fruit juice ($3.50) - 4 stars","257":"This is my favorite supper haunt. Every time I come here, I end up ordering about half of the stuff on the menu. I know there are better quality dim sum out there, but none can beat the variety. Do not be intimidated by the line. Yes there's always a discouraging queue of people waiting on the roadside, but it is also moves fast since they have sooo many tables.A few of my favorites are:- Liu sha bao (salted egg yolk bao)- Steamed pork ribs- Chee chong fun with prawn \/ charsiew- Mee suah kueh- Beancurd chicken roll- Shredded dried beancurd parsleyYou can ask for chili oil and they'll give it to you generously.","258":"The dim sum I had from here during my summer in sg has made me unable to enjoy any other dim sum since. My friends and I came every chance we could and it especially hit the spot after clubbing, since it's known for being open till 6am. Over a year later, we still reminisce about the salted egg yolk custard buns, which are h e a v e n. I also highly recommend the rice rolls w\/ char siew, pig trotters and (of course) the xiao long bao, but everything else tasted good too (except i would skip the egg tarts and go to tai cheong for those). Swee choon is will forever have a piece of my heart. Try at your own risk, you may never be able to eat average dim sum again.","259":"Honestly, we were so excited to get some dim sum at Singapore and the place seemed to have pretty good reviews, but it really wasn't anything special. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff and nothing really stood out. For going to a lot of dim sum places, this place was subpar at best :\/ They also do this thing in a lot of Singapore restaurants where they charge you for hand towels and tap water. They put the towel on our table for use but then, we realized after that you get charged and they don't really specify that.","260":"If you want classic dim sum dishes or Chinese main dishes Swee Choon is a must try!!!!!! Extremely well known for the dim sum, Swee Choon has all your favourite dim sum dishes, but have elevated the food to be more refined and more delicious!!!!! A definite must try is their salty egg yolk bun!!!!! The bun is so light and fluffy, while the egg yolk is so creamy and oozes out of the bun!!!!! The egg yolk also is so flavourful and compliments the soft bun so well!!!! Another must try is the fried taro dumplings filled with delicious meat!!!!! These taro dumplings are fried to perfection and are much larger than what you normally find in other restaurants!!!! They also serve fried turnip cake and fried red bean crepes!!!!! If you want a dish with more substance or bigger portions they also have rice and noodles dishes!!!! Highly recommend their Ho Fun, which is a rice noodle dish with an egg sauce!!!!! The Ho Fun is so flavourful and also comes with veggies and seafood!!!! This place is a must try for both dim sum and normal Chinese dishes!!!!!","261":"Great food and superior prices. Don't worry about the long line out front they move quickly. You use your phone for ordering so the food comes quickly but maybe a little out of sequence. We had the crispy fried pork, saut\u00c3\u00a9ed long beans with minced pork and the Sichuan chili oil wonton. I have to say all the items were the best I have ever had. Finished the meal off with chilled cocoanut pudding, for a great finish.","262":"I'm a big fan of dim sum! I have tried a lot in different country. The line is really fast, there are a lot of place inside, with AC. About the food, Siu Mai is Ok, Ha kao has two big shrimps inside, they come by 2 pieces. \u00c2\u00a0Xiao long bao, skin soft but the soup wasn't there, just a little bit.., prawn chee cheong fun only for dinner (...). For the rest ( fried dim sum and desert ) were just Ok. So I won't come back for sure. There are many better dim sum restaurant in Singapore. Go there only if all the others dim sum are close (they open all night).","263":"This was the last stop of our 3-part brunch and by the time we arrived, we were pretty much eating for sport. We ordered a few savory and a few sweet dim sum dishes and tried our best to eat everything.The Portuguese Egg Tart was satisfying as was the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun. Although the sweet items were good, the savory ones were just ok.I'm kind of surprised by the number of great reviews for this place. Compared to dim sum in Hong Kong or even in the US, this wasn't that impressive. Save your precious stomach space for something more special.","264":"Pretty solid dim sum place with a variety of dishes. My favorites were the pork ribs, the big bao, and the mango dessert. They have a ton of options so you can satisfy any picky person.","265":"The dimsum of Swee Choon can easily stand next to the more upscale versions in town and now they are open for lunch too plus they still serve the late night crowds!Their custard buns are hands down the best version I had throughout Singapore and one of the reasons to come back. Other things I like include:Xiao Long Bao, Egg tarts, Har Kau,...The no-nonsense efficient style of the restaurant makes me forgiving for the lack of contact between the servers and the customers and unlike at other Chinese restaurants in town, I've never been given even as much as an eye twitch that I don't speak Chinese.Love it!","266":"Portuguese egg tart. \u00c2\u00a0Not too sweet. Flaky layers of crust. One of the best. Bao with creamy inside. \u00c2\u00a0Very nice while hot. Xiao Long Bao. Soup is nice. Juicy meat on the inside. Sticky rice with chicken. Carrot cake. Crispy edges. Late night eats.Just say yes.","267":"My go-to-spot for dim sum in Singapore. You can find most of your typical dim sum dishes (siew Mai, har gao, rice rolls, BBQ pork buns, etc) plus more, such as soup dumplings. You have to also try the green onion pancake, as well as the chili wontons!A filling meal for two ran us about $30 SGD, which is a steal. Only reason why I gave Swee Choon 4 stars is because the auntie at the the counter was annoyed when I told her I didn't eat the appetizers they put on the table, which we knew they were going to charge us for. If you're not going to eat the appetizers, be sure to tell the waitress to take it away or else they'll charge you for it. Aside from this, I think swee choon is great for the money if you're looking for dim sum in Singapore.","268":"Pros: Overnight HoursCheapFastCons:Food is not deliciousThis location is a place frequented by after-party drunkards, may get noisy. Food is very cheap, but only mediocre.","269":"Great food!Great service!Good for expatsThe picture menu helped.You need cash or a card that's used in Singapore to pay. Luckily there's a ATM across the street. We had fun and will go back when in town again.","270":"Great place for dim sum in singapore. Their shrimp dumplings are still the best I've ever had. thin skin with a bunch of shrimp inside. Get the deep fried banana and shrimp dumpling -- sound weird but actually very nice.","271":"Experience: I went here for my birthday and loved it. They had such tasty cocktails and great cuts of meat, which they brought out to show us and explain each cut. Since we came for my birthday, they also had the option to leave a birthday message on the dessert we ordered. When we ordered a black coffee and they brought a cappuccino, I let them know so that they could exchange it and they took it off the bill altogether. They are clearly very eager to please. Environment: Clearly a fine dining place. They have a walkway along a wall of windows where you can look out at all the places in Singapore. The windows are marked with small signs noting what part of the city it is (chinatown, downtown, etc). Food: The steak was so good. I got the flat iron which was known for its high marbling rating (I think it was 6-7+), but you can always ask them there for more details. All of the sides were good too, but the main dishes that stuck out were the steaks and the desserts: the pavlova was delicious, and such a hard dessert to get right. Price: It's a nice place to be prepared to pay top dollar. Steaks are anywhere for $60-$100+ and even a cocktail is $20-$25. I'm sure you can get other dishes not quite as expensive as the steaks, but I think that is the main appeal of a nice place like this. Service: Fantastic, but a little slow towards the end (when we ordered small things like coffee to finish off the meal).","272":"We celebrated our honeymoon dinner At salt grill and sky bar. Friendly professional staff we loved our server \"eff\" she was really helpful for us to pick the right dinner . The glass down and the view is magical from this place .","273":"The view is impressive. The dishes are more beautiful to look at than to eat. We had the set lunch. Except for the excellent and gorgeous-looking steak tartare appetiser, all other dishes were good but not memorable. Salt's rib eye was too salty. But then, at $49++, this is not bad value for the overall experience.","274":"The food wasn't memorable or anything. I opted with the tasting menu so I can at least enjoy the scenic views a little bit longer, but I soon realized halfway into the tasting menu, that I just wanted to leave. The food wasn't bad, but this was no fine dining. The dessert which was the apple and liquorice cream was the only decent thing from the menu.So lesson learned...if you visit Salt Grill, stick with the regular menu, or just hang out at the bar and order at least $80 worth of drinks since that's the minimum amount to hang out here. But it will probably only take you 2-3 drinks to get to this amount since cocktails will run around $25 a drink.Views are great though.","275":"My wife and I had dinner here last night on the 55th floor observation level next to a dirt streaked window. \u00c2\u00a0I had a soggy, water logged salad, and a steak not cooked as requested (medium well, but served with a pink thick center), with the over spiced, gamely taste required of controlled rot (\"aged\") meat. \u00c2\u00a0My wife's fish entree was too salty and in an unpleasant pickled sauce. \u00c2\u00a0One star for a nice dim light atmosphere.","276":"The obvious wow factor for this place is the sweeping view. We went to dinner and had unfettered view of the Singapore skyline - that was remarkable. The food is generally good, with some misses. We did not care about the crab omelette that came highly recommended. But the Bungalow pork and octopus were both great starters. For mains, the sirloin was overly crusted but was good. Grilled asparagus on the side was also very good. I would rate the food a solid 3.5-stars but pushed it up to four for the excellent wine recommendation. Service here is strange. The disposition of the staff is wonderful. They are all friendly without being patronising. But there were service lapses. For example, we ordered three starters. Two were served together, then there was a 45-minute wait before the third one arrived. Worth a visit!","277":"Wow. a totally unexpected surprise. We've been meaning to check this place out for awhile bc of its great view from the 50th+ storey of Ion Orchard, but kept postponing our visit bc we were told from friends that the food is not worth it. You are basically paying for the view, they'd say. But we decided to finally try it out on a random Sunday lunch, and ultimately and surprisingly had one of the most satisfying dining experience in Sing. 1. The service was perfect. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and escorted to one of the many seats next to the windows for the perfect view and we were able to see our condo from our seat! the kind and attentive waiter really knew his menu and was always readily available. 3. The lunch set menu was so much cheaper than we expected, at $49 for 3 courses including tea or coffee. what a bargain, considering the location and the fact that the dishes mimicked that of dishes at fine dining, or were even better. 4. the dishes were so delicious! to start, they gave us complimentary radish snack with homemade potato chips.for Entree, we got:-'Glass' Sydney crab omelette in miso mustard broth, their signature dish which was okay for me, but D loved it. -Baked bone marrow, onion, watercress, and garlic toast. \u00c2\u00a0 this is the entree to get. bone marrow was the best I've tried in a long time! It was prepared in such a way that I've never tried before, drenched in garlic and other sauces, and it was just perfection with the garlic toast pairing.Main course:-Seared Blue Fin tuna, potato, pimento, softquail egg, olives & anchovies dressing: \u00c2\u00a0never thought i'd write a comment on an egg, but i've never tried an egg that was cooked So perfectly that it's bouncy yet so soft. \u00c2\u00a0tuna and all the ingredients came together so well.-Goats cheese gnocchi, beets, vincotto, burnt butter dressing, pistachio, raisons: again, the ingredients in the dish came together so well, that we were forking everything together in one-bite to experience the bursting of flavors. it was perfect. dessert:we got the sorbet, crumbs and berries and dessert of the day which was a winner. We exited the restaurant as if we paid over $200 for the service, location, and the amazing food, when it was around $110 altogether. Why didn't we come sooner? it's a perfect place for dates, girl dates, and for visitors as well!","278":"Plus: Nice view and high staff's hospitality.Booking through web or phone easily.Minus: Food is good enough, can't be excellent.Table arrangement are too close, can't have private space.","279":"I had been to this restaurant a number of times, but this was the first I was coming for afternoon tea. The Afternoon Tea Platter costs $38++ per person, inclusive of a tea or coffee, or $53++ per person including a glass of G.H Mumm Champagne. It is available from 2.30pm to 4:45pm. The coffee is non refillable, while as for tea one could ask for refillable of hot water.The afternoon tea platter consisted of Crostini, avocado, cherry tomato, olive,Ham & turkey, beetroot, manchego, tortilla,Smoked salmon, cucumber, chive, cr\u00c3\u00a8me cheese on rye,Chocolate & jam lamington,Coffee macaroon,Tim tam chocolate tart,Red velvet cup cake,Anzac biscuit,Citrus marshmallow, andScones.The tea set was nicely plated but I felt that it was a bit too overpriced for such little food. May I was expecting much more from this price. The Citrus marshmallow is my favourite as it had a rather zesty taste which peaked one up. The rest were not bad too.I had requested for a table by the window through online reservation, but was showed to a table by the frosted window with no view of the outside. Not sure if it was due to the fact that I was having a 3 years old boy with me at the time. We were seated far away from other customers and had difficulties getting the attention of the staff. As it was between lunch and dinner meal times, there was limited choices for a 3 years old. No children menu, so ended up ordering French fries ($11++) for him. Total bill for the fries was $12.95.","280":"I've been dying to try this place for a while now, mainly because I love steak & was curious about the 56th floor of ion. So when the fianc\u00c3\u00a9 brought me here for my birthday, I was really excited. They do have a wide array of cuts, and I loved that they brought over a giant platter and explained which cut was served for each dish. It made it easier to chose. Their meat was pretty good, though mine was a little over (asked for rare, but it was closer to medium rare\/medium). Their red wine sauce was really good though! Francis and I were a little over ambitious and thought we could finish a side of asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and onsen egg, but we couldn't. This side dish did taste a little strange though, still can't figure out why I didn't like it that much. Dessert was average, the chocolate lava cake was slightly over baked so it didn't ooze out nicely. I wouldn't say I'm super disappointed, but I'd probably only go back there for the meat and the view.","281":"Restaurant Week lunch. I have always wanted to try the food at Salt Grill & Sky Bar but it is always full during restaurant week, well, except for this week. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars: The experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm. The reason was due to the overwhelming response and so we will only have 1 hour 15 mins to dine if we come at 12 pm.The question that pop into my head was \"didn't they already have a fix number of tables for Restaurant Week\"? and \"Why was this not indicated when making the booking?\" And this was not the first time Salt has participated in Restaurant Week, wouldn't they have known better on what to expect?It is quite disconcerting to have to re-arrange our schedule just so we will not have a rushed lunch. In any case, we decided to change our reservations to 11.30 am. I got there just before 11.30 am and was told the restaurant was not ready as the staff are getting their briefing then. 2nd strike. I made the effort to be on time, and at the time suggested by the restaurant, I would expect to be granted the courtesy to be seated accordingly. Cooling my heels for a while, it was another 5-10 minutes later before I was finally shown to a table. The \"3rd\" not so happy experience was very minor - I asked for a window table but I was told it was for non-restaurant week customers...that reason did not fly with me as a friend had the window table the day before and she was also dining on Restaurant Week menu. Anyway, that was really a minor thing but the whole pre-dining experience was enough to make me put Salt on the \"first and last time\" dining list. Back to the place and food:I like the simplicity of the place with its high ceiling and modern furnishing. Service was professional, attentive, polite and not overly friendly. What caught me by surprise was the basket the manager brought over for us to put our bags. That was thoughtful. Water was topped up without having to ask (they do ask if you want still or sparkling water, but you could request for warm or iced tap water at no extra cost), the courses were well paced \u00c2\u00a0so we did not feel rushed. In the end we left slightly after 1.15 pm, but never once were we made to feel we had to hurry through the meal. So kudos to the service staff for making the actual dining experience to be enjoyable after all.Restaurant Week Menu:Starter - chicken liver foie gras parfait, truffled butter, toasted brioche. This was really superb. A generous serving of smooth pate in a small jar which went very well with the brioche and complimentary bread Main - Maori lakes tenderloin, blue cheese pressed potato, spinach and red wine jus. I asked for medium and it was done just right, not too bloody with a bit of pink in the center. The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite. I wished it was a bigger portion. Just have to come back next time for the 200 gm served in the ala carte menu. The pressed potato (in thin slices) with blue cheese was ok, just a hint of blue cheese so those who do not like it will not be turned off by it. Dessert - tasting platter Creme Brulee with salted caramel ice cream - my favorite of the lot. Creamy custard covered with the sugar glaze and topped with salted caramel ice cream. There were also chocolate pearls hidden giving it a nice crunch.Chocolate bar - surprisingly I did not find it that great. There were some wafer bits which tasted a bit soft, not crispy at all. Licorice ice cream with lime and sago - never a big fan of licorice though the lime did give it a bit of contrasting flavor and made it more palatable to me.Coffee was normal. You could select the tea of your choice, you just have to ask them what is available. So yes, I would want to go back again, just to have the tenderloin and for the view. It is a very nice view and will probably be fantastic to dine in the evening to see the sunset.NOTE: To get there, you need to turn right and right and left (when you see the TV) to get to the elevator to Salt Grill. It can get a tad confusing and dark to find.","282":"My husband and I recently celebrated my birthday here, and I had a wonderful time! (I say \"I\" because I stuck him with the bill at the end of the night!)Salt Grill is an awesome place for a special occasion dinner, and I also agree with the other reviewers who say it's a good venue for treating out your parental units.To get there, head to the concierge at the 4th floor of Ion. Walk around the desk and you'll see the welcome area for Salt. Someone will guide you to the special elevator bank that will whisk you up to the 55th floor.Walking into the main dining room, your breath will be taken away by the lovely views of Singapore. I'm glad we went here for dinner because I enjoyed watching the city light up and transition from early evening to dusk.To start, we ordered the oysters (served natural), and the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette. I can't comment on the oysters as I'm allergic, but I will say the Sydney crab omelette was a-ok. I know people rave about it, but it's simply not my type of dish.However, I really loved our main. We did the meat cut for two, which changes daily. That day, it was a bone-in ribeye. It came with onion rings, a rocket salad, and mash. Miguel doesn't like potatoes much, so we asked if we could replace the mash with the roast garlic mushrooms and luckily they obliged.The rocket salad was my type of salad: blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. All so good! The steak was juicy and I loved the horseradish\/pepper jus that it was drenched in. Throw in a decent bottle of wine (we decided on a cab sauv from California) and we were in heaven. For a moment, I was worried because the table next to us brought a baby with them... but thankfully the baby was quiet and didn't disturb our dinner. Overall, the ambiance was set nicely with the dim lighting and bossa nova soundtrack in the background. The service was impeccable and we didn't feel rushed at all throughout the evening. If you're feelin' spendy, this is a great option to consider. :)","283":"If you want to score, this is the place to bring your wife or girlfriend! Salt Grill oozes with sex appeal. You enter the restaurant through a welcome area on the 4th floor of ION and through a special elevator bank behind the art gallery. Once you reach the top floor, you are greeted by a beautiful dining space and jaw dropping views of Singapore.Making a reservation is a must, especially if you want to secure a spot with one of the limited tables that line glass viewing area.Our order included: raw oysters, glass Sydney crab omelette, rocket salad, and bone-in ribeye steak for two. The glass Sydney Crab Omelette was a definite winner and is a must have appetizer. The Rocket Salad with blue cheese, pear and candied walnuts is a great choice for anyone in the mood for a refreshing salad.The clear highlight for me was without question the Bone-in Rib Eye. The steak was juicy, perfectly cooked, and mouth watering. However, I'm a fanatic of steaks that are juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside (Heston Blumenthal way of cooking steak). Don't get me wrong, Salt grill delivers a damn good steak, but I can't give it the \"best in Singapore\" designation. The restaurant was also nice enough to alter my sides from mash potatoes to roasted garlic mushrooms, free of charge.Overall, Salt is a wonderful restaurant and is among the very best in Singapore. 5 stars for the ambience and breathtaking views and 4 stars for the food.","284":"Dining at @saltgrillandskybar #beautifulplace #wonderfulservice #greatfood starting with tasty chips on the house, followed by insightful knowledge while being served red wine . Restaurant uses #coravin to serve their wine, which helps preserves the wine within the bottle without opening it #genius even the bread \u00c2\u00a0served was fragrant & went well with the olive oil & smashed nuts. Before serving the starters, the waitress, Eve, took out a crumber\/crumb scoop\/crumb picker... whatever you call it, & cleared the bread crumbs from the table with amazing efficiency! The starters continued to impress our taste buds as the shrimp sauce blended nicely with the scallop to deliver a fresh, yet full flavor. It was so good that we wiped it off our plates in the blink of an eye \u00c2\u00a0mains came shortly after, & I must say that the pace at which the food was served wasn't too fast, & not too slow, which helped create a great transition between the dishes. Barramundi with prawn \u00c2\u00a0tempura for me, & medium tenderloin for Serena. The full dish name was too long & I didn't note it down. The food quality's simply world-class, & I'd love to come back again for special occasions \u00c2\u00a0& only for that, cuz the price was more to the steep end!","285":"Had a great experience. Came here with my colleagues for a team dinner and everyone enjoyed their meal. The views are amazing. I ordered the salmon and it was excellent. The drinks I had here were very good as well.","286":"I've been to this place twice with business associates and both times were top notch. I can't say enough about this place. It has a great view, a nice atmosphere, attentive waiters and waitresses and amazing food. It's a quiet restaurant which I enjoyed very much with being able to have a quiet and enjoyable conversation with my associates. The appetizers and desserts are quite small, which I really like, because it allows you to enjoy an entire meal without feeling over stuffed. Make sure that you have a reservation because this place is really sought after. ENJOY!","287":"How can I objectively write a review view from the 57th floor, overlooking Singapore and not be swayed by the views?!?! \u00c2\u00a0Food was actually very nice. Beginning with the sharing starters, the bone marrow (not for me, but others enjoyed) and charred octopus were delicious. Main entree was the pan fried snapper and squid ink risotto -- wonderful! Desert was a strawberry cream and perfect. Service was equally outstanding, great evening with work colleagues on the top table overlooking the city. Incredible experience!","288":"This is a review of a Friday evening dinner date at Salt grill and Sky bar.I have to admit the view is pretty spectacular. \u00c2\u00a0Well, if you like urban skylines (I do), it is.I was late. \u00c2\u00a0My date was even later. \u00c2\u00a0The staff made no mention of this.The room is a very well appointed. \u00c2\u00a0It is an impressive space with both modern and classic touches. \u00c2\u00a0There is a large glass roof. \u00c2\u00a0It truly hearkens to my expectations of traditional white-tablecloth fine-dining. \u00c2\u00a0I was surprised that the restaurant was only halfway full. \u00c2\u00a0It is a very quiet and restrained restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0The staff even sings \"Happy Birthday\" in a barely audible tone.This continues to spill over into the service. \u00c2\u00a0This is professional and polite. \u00c2\u00a0It is reserved. \u00c2\u00a0It is attentive. \u00c2\u00a0There isn't any unnecessary chit-chat. The service was impeccable. \u00c2\u00a0It was timely. \u00c2\u00a0The staff was there when they should be. \u00c2\u00a0The server was knowledgeable. \u00c2\u00a0This is the very essence of fine dining service. \u00c2\u00a0The meal was also well-paced.This was the first restaurant I've visited in Singapore that offered a complimentary glass of champagne to start the meal. \u00c2\u00a0The food ranged from good to extremely good. \u00c2\u00a0The presentation of each dish was another classic touch. \u00c2\u00a0They were beautifully plated without giving into to being overly showy.Complimentary Bread - A very nice fresh bread was provided. \u00c2\u00a0It was served with olive oil and a mixture of high quality salt to dip it in. \u00c2\u00a0When she quickly answered no to \"would you like more bread\", my dinner companion saved me from my own appetite.tinyurl.com\/c2wjy4nScallop raviolo in squid ink pasta, spiced tomato consomme, corn puree - I only had one bite of this. \u00c2\u00a0It ended up squarely in front of my date. \u00c2\u00a0It was very rich. \u00c2\u00a0If they provided this as a main dish, I could easily order it. \u00c2\u00a0For me, all of the ingredients worked well together. \u00c2\u00a0I do not have a photo of this dish.Roasted cherry tomatoes, Burrata cheese, peppers, grilled bread - This was extremely good. \u00c2\u00a0It came close to allowing the red peppers to dominate. \u00c2\u00a0But the creaminess of the Burrata and the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes helped to keep them in check. \u00c2\u00a0The bread was grilled perfectly to hold the dish together.tinyurl.com\/akv3ufgDuck sliders, pickled spring onion, cucumber - These were very good. \u00c2\u00a0If I had my choice, I would probably have selected a high quality Western style bun over the more Asian style presentation. \u00c2\u00a0Excluding the \"bun\", the ingredients provided an almost bahn mi experience. \u00c2\u00a0tinyurl.com\/catdjllLamb cutlets Maori Lakes New Zealand, Provencal herbs - My friend ordered the lamb. \u00c2\u00a0She was kind \u00c2\u00a0enough to share a bite. \u00c2\u00a0It was very good. \u00c2\u00a0The balance of the flavour of the lamb was perfect for my own personal taste. \u00c2\u00a0She seemed to enjoy it also.tinyurl.com\/azdxbhoCorn fed Spatchcock, Cajun and herb spices - I am not quite sure what made this dish a spatchcock, a cooking term for removing the main two bones and cooking the chicken flat. \u00c2\u00a0I am also not sure what made it cajun. \u00c2\u00a0It was certainly too mild to be considered Cajun. \u00c2\u00a0However, it was extremely good. \u00c2\u00a0The chicken was moist and tender. \u00c2\u00a0While not particularly Cajun, the spices came together very well. \u00c2\u00a0In finer restaurants, I seldom order chicken. \u00c2\u00a0I am glad I tried theirs. \u00c2\u00a0It was some of the best chicken I've had in quite awhile.tinyurl.com\/aou4p6qWe had sides of truffled mashed potato and roasted mushrooms. \u00c2\u00a0Each of these were prepared in a very traditional manner. \u00c2\u00a0They both served as comfortable compliments to our main dishes.Pear Torte - This was her selected dessert. \u00c2\u00a0I tried it. \u00c2\u00a0I would have preferred the pear to be a little softer. \u00c2\u00a0Plus, the pear tasted more like an an apple to me. \u00c2\u00a0But, it was a nice dessert.tinyurl.com\/b2hamn8Cr\u00c3\u00a8me br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e with salted caramel ice cream - This was not a traditional cr\u00c3\u00a8me br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e. \u00c2\u00a0There was no hard carmelized layer to crack through. \u00c2\u00a0For me, this dessert was more about the combination of ingredients with the ice cream as the anchor of the dish. \u00c2\u00a0I thought it was a great way to end the meal.tinyurl.com\/ag39gu9Receipt ($489.63)tinyurl.com\/bys3jbkOverall, Salt grill + Sky bar offers exactly what I expect from a true fine-dining experience. \u00c2\u00a0The room is beautiful. \u00c2\u00a0The staff is professional and on-point. \u00c2\u00a0The meal flows at a proper pace. \u00c2\u00a0The food is consistently very good. \u00c2\u00a0It also affords that added touch of a truly beautiful urban view. \u00c2\u00a0Throughout writing this review, I mentally debated four stars or five stars. A part of me thought the food fell just slightly short. \u00c2\u00a0Another part thought the enjoyment of the experience was slightly diminished by the fact the room was not nearly full. \u00c2\u00a0In the end though, I do think this was a five star experience.","289":"third restaurant week date in a row!for the uninitiated, you need to head to the 4th floor of ion, where the visitor's info booth is.their reception is co located there.they will then show you the way to a separate lift to the premises.they open at 6pm sharp, so even if you are early you cant get in.this is definitely a date impressing kind of place.the view reminds me of equinox and jaan.this is the most expensive of the restaurant week menu priced at $55.so in effect you are probably paying $20 for the view?the restaurant week set dinner is made up of 3 courses:for the first course, we had the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette, miso mustard broth.nice flavour from the crab as well as the mild miso mustard broth.lots of garnishing on top which can be a nightmare for some.for the main, the spatchcock is highly recommended.a juvenile chicken butterflied for faster cooking.it was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.tender to the fork and juicy in the mouth.the grape and currant dressing gave the dish a sweet edge.the parsnip mash is also a nice change from the usual mash that we get.for dessert, you get a liquorice parfait in lime jus.can sound foul to some, including myself, who is not a fan of liquorice.but to my utter surprise, i was won over and really enjoyed it!the liquorice was used in moderation.and it was cleverly musked by the fresh lime juice, zest and lime fruit slices.you still get an after taste of liquorice but not a strong lingering one.pieces of thin biscuit wafer were delightfully crisp and buttery.the coffee that came with the set was sad!i guess i am comparing it to the one i had at latteria which was awesome.one sip and i abandoned ship.maybe it would be safer for you to go with their tea instead.if you would like wine to accompany your meal, they do have 2 special offer for restaurant week.however, we chose to go with the luke mangan's red and white wine by the glass in their ala carte menu.now for the ala carte orders:i started with the Fig tart with caramelized onion and blue cheese, verjuicedressing.the waiter duly reminded that it will take 12 mins to prepare this dish.must be really good then!:)it did not disappoint.the figs could be sweeter though.a thin pastry base topped with caramelized onions then round flat slices of fresh figs and finally some melted blue cheese and some sprouts.again the blue cheese may not go well with some, but i liked it.for mains, i had the Scotch 250g Rangers Valley VIC 300 days grain fed.grilled to medium and served on a bed of french beans with red wine jus.i had the english mustard and horse radish on the side.the beef was not spectacular.cooked as requested but only average in flavour.priced at $75, again you must be paying $20 for the view?we also ordered a side of Broccolini with confit eschallot.i must say they do their veg very well.not one strand was overcooked.all al dente.they could, however, be more generous with their confit eschallot though.service staff here are obviously all seasoned ones and very well drilled.japanese style efficiency in just in time precision.more hits than misses and if you are willing to pay more for the view and romantic ambience then you will be a fan too.","290":"The 3 course lunch meal was totally worth it at $63 ++ with the breathtaking city view.Service was also impeccable.","291":"The Naked FinnWell known for its seafood for dinner which I have tried many times before.

Most of the restaurants here don't offer a drink list and are small pop-up shops that are outdoors and the humidity has been a bit of a change from my SoCal weather. Haha so that's why The Naked Fin stood out to me. Further more there was a video. It was a quick little blurb about the owner and how The Naked Fin got started. \u00c2\u00a0It gave all the more reassurance this would be the experience I was hoping for. Once I arrived it was what I expected and more. The food cooking in the back smelt great they staff was so greeting and really helped me pick what would be best for me as I didn't understand most of the menu and terminology. The big reason I wanted to go as well was this Baby Indian Squid App that I saw in the video and on their yelp page. I have enclosed a photo. OMG! It was even better than I imagined. It tasted like crispy sesame seed oil. They cooked them just right and I was so happy I got them. The prawn soup was great as well. It pair great with the white wine (I would compare to a Pino Grigio) they went excellent together and I was very happy with the service food and over all experience here. If you're in Singapore The Naked Fin is a MUST TRY!","294":"Outstanding lunch place away from town. We had the prawn noodles, lobster roll and baby squid. Everything was impressively sourced, particularly the squid and prawns. Service was excellent as well. Will be back!","295":"Love the space. If anyone remember Klee (now defunct cocktail bar that was too early for its time) at Portsdown Road, this place reminds me of it, except that it is way more than just a cocktail bar.We hiked down to Gillman Village, firstly to get a drink, plus to try out the prawn vermicelli that received a glowing review in the Straits Times. The prawn vermicelli is served as a supper menu item, from 10pm on weekdays and 10.30pm on weekends. The prawn broth is made by frying amaebi shrimps and Sakura ebi, then simmered in pork stock for 7 hours. When served, the server will reiterate that there is absolutely no sugar or seasoning added. Your bowl of yumminess is served with 4 choices of grilled shrimps (banana, giant tiger, gamba espanola, gamba carabinero) on the side. You are also given a condiment tray: sea salt, Japanese spice, chilli powder, plus get this......pork lard made from iberico jamon.All those of course comes with a price. We went with the gamba espanola, which has a large head that comes with the most amazing roe. Slurp it all up from the head and you are in gamba haven. The flesh of this shrimp is not firm like our usual shrimps, but the taste of the roe more than made up for it. One of this shrimp comes in at $15 on their ala carte menu...Other dishes we had:- diver-caught Atlantic scallops cerviche - while it was awesome, it is also much too expensive at $20 for two bite size portion. I understand that this will cost much more at a sushi restaurant, but still...- grilled baby Indian squids - so good. Done in all natural goodness without batter so you really taste the succulent juiciness and with a slight smokey crispness at the edge. I can eat this forever.- pan-fried fish. Can't remember which fish we had but it came with an awesomely crispy skin.Started off with some very fruity cocktails. All the cocktails are deliciously fruity yet strong. The kyoho grape one is full of the beautiful notes of this amazing fruit, pulp included so that you are sure this is the real deal. Strangely, the drinks are served kind of ice-blended, so you do get a brain freeze if you drink it immediately.Menu is strictly seafood. If you are allergic to seafood, or looking for meats, avoid this place. The pricing is on the high side but they pride themselves on quality seafood.","296":"I really want to like this place more, but I couldn't.Yes, I do appreciate the effort taken to source the freshest ingredients, the lengths gone to prepare a tasty broth, etc.I also understand the high costs of operating, and the fact that quality seafood costs a lot in Singapore.The food is indeed delicious. But it lacks a wow factor needed to make up for the high price.","297":"The Naked Finn is run by Ken Loon whom I met through a friend. \u00c2\u00a0Since I was in Singapore he invited me to his restaurant and I spent an evening chatting with him and enjoying his food.As is always a good idea, I let the host choose the menu, so Ken got us an assortment including squid, fish, scallop, pork, risotto etc. \u00c2\u00a0All of which was very good, though if I am going to pick favorites, the squid was really special. \u00c2\u00a0Grilled to perfection and just the right consistency. \u00c2\u00a0This is something I am going to miss when going back to Norway.Okay, I'm going to pick one more favorite: \u00c2\u00a0the pork. \u00c2\u00a0Incredibly tender and juicy shoulder of iberico pork (if I am not mistaken). \u00c2\u00a0 I ate most of it without any form of sauce or condiments. \u00c2\u00a0It was just so good by itself.I also got a tour of the fish tanks and the kitchen. \u00c2\u00a0 The place has a very modern feel while at the same time feeling human-centric. \u00c2\u00a0Ken has his books and his desk out in the restaurant. \u00c2\u00a0Including his big stack of papers on bivalves :-).The fish we had (I don't remember the name of the species. \u00c2\u00a0I don' think it is something I've had before), Ken had caught himself. \u00c2\u00a0He has a very hands-on approach with the raw materials which reminds me a bit about F\u00c3\u00a4viken.I like down-to-earth restaurant experiences that is about good food and good conversation. \u00c2\u00a0And this is as good as it gets.I had an excellent evening!(To my Norwegian friends: \u00c2\u00a0the name of the restaurant has nothing to do with naked people from Finland. \u00c2\u00a0I suggest you visit the restaurant and ask for yourself what the name means)","298":"They serve the BEST cocktails you can ever find in Singapore!I love the fact that they live up to their name of being \"naked\", for the fact that the ingredients used in the choice of seafood are simply salt, pepper and olive oil to bring out the freshness in their seafood!The cocktails, served at -12\u00c2\u00b0C, taste FRESH!Made my first visit there from friend's recommendation and tried all of their 3 signature cocktails, Strawberry, Coconut and Kyoho grapes.The ingredients are freshly pacotized (according to their website), and it seriously brought me to heaven!Ordered a portion of baby squids for sharing (as it was rather late that night, that we headed there for some really chill night out) - SO FRESH!I have never imagined that COCONUT can make such an awesome ingredient for a cocktail. lovely surprise!p.s. waiter was SO NICE, and asked us \"is everything ok?\" after serving. top notch!I love that place, the environment (can get really quiet as they have limited tables), the drinks, the food!Gonna frequent this place whenever I have some cocktail cravings!","299":"What a hidden gem inside Gilman Barrack! After some gallery hopping a group of us came for dinner. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of food. The restaurant only have less than 8 tables so I'd recommend making a ressy ahead of time.We started with some razor clam ceviche and baby squid, both very fresh and delicately seasoned. For entr\u00c3\u00a9e we had their iberico pork and grilled fish, both cooked to near perfection. Will definitely be back for more!","300":"5 stars cos it's so hard to fault this little gem. From the service experience while booking the place to the actual dinning experience, it's one of the best I've experienced in this part of the world. The space itself is great. Small and cosy but doesn't feel cramped at all. Unpretentious with IKEA kitchenware and yet tasteful at the same time. Music's at the perfect volume and playlist is legit. Food is just delightful. Fresh and thoughtfully put together. Me and the missus had the set dinner for 2 and every dish that came with it was really tasty. The cocktails are amazing as well. Simple yet punchy. Most of all, the people there are lovely. They all looked like they really love what they do, and was informative and engaged throughout the night. Go, if you want a charming, non-pretentious and overall great dining experience.","301":"LIKE.The perfect ending to any Gillman Barracks visit (or rather hike) is a dinner at the Naked Finn. Service is great, dishes are great, the place is great. There isn't much I could complain about... Well, maybe the music was a tad 1980s ballad-ish, but I can forgive that considering how rarely I find a gem amidst Singapore's great, big culinary landscape.We ordered the chilled bee hoon which was fantastic. It's large so order it to share. The squid, the prawns, the fish - all the seafoods were grilled, seared and fried to perfection. The wine list wasn't over-whelming but instead offered good, simple, unpretentious choices. Add to the evening some pretty fantastic cocktails (our favourite du soir was the coconut one) and it's about as good a meal as one can find.Oh and the cherry on top: the prices were very reasonable.Have you sensed that I really like this place yet?","302":"We went to this restaurant because of its reputation for simple good food. We decided to go for lunch. The restaurant is a shack located in isolation next to a running track. \u00c2\u00a0Would have had a hard time locating it if not for my trusty GPS. The restaurant is small, so reservations are a must. You need to call them in the afternoon otherwise no one answers the phone. The lunch menu is simple and uncomplicated. We had the lobster roll with creme freche and a fish and chips. The roll was excellent with generous portions of lobster cooked well. Likewise the fish and chips though I think it was a tad overdone. The fish they use is the ling fish. Line caught and very good. Price wise is a little high, but with 3 portions of lobster what do you expect. The meal for 6 persons including 4 chendol deserts was $255","303":"expensive seafood at this uppity too-cool-for-school restaurant at the gilman barracks. this place - well. the food is good (let's get it out of the way), but it's simply cooked, it's simply expensive, and service is pretty inadequate for the price you're paying.I simply don't understand the hype - seafood is abundant in singapore, and a more-than-decent dish is more than easily found (even at your neighborhood czechar store) - it's the sort of seafood restaurant I'd imagine in a land-locked part of the US, where seafood is both posh and inaccessible.but I'll give it to them that the seafood is fresh and delicious in its simplicity, but I'd hazard a guess, too, that anyone with half-decent cooking skills can churn out similar dishes.the most economical option here would be to take their set menu (which is still pretty price-hefty) for a taster of their dishes. it starts with a simply dressed salad, and fried vermicelli noodles (simpler-ly known as fried beehoon in this part of the world) are brought to the table as accompaniment to the subsequent dishes.and it's good right, but a lot of it is due in part to the fresh produce they've got (which is admirable) as opposed to any particular skill (which is the point of visiting restaurants). not that not-overcooking seafood is not a skill (omg, triple negatives!) - but it's a pretty basic one.fat, plump clams in an easily-drinkable, more-ish soup that went well with the beehoon, and plainly seared scallops served in-shell with garlic. plump and sweet, those were delicious.these were followed by grilled mozambique - read: skinny - lobsters that had a good charred flavor, the same of which you could smell and taste in the seared fish and baby squid. that baby squid was pretty delicious - they were chewy but tender, with none of that crisp nothingness that happens with deep-frying.so the food was good - even if I might complain about price - but service is pretty hit-miss. the good thing was that we had chirpy waiters dishing up our food - but we had to be chased out after barely two hours of a long many-coursed dinner (such is the quirk of trendy, busy restaurants), and they refused to bring me a glass of water when I first walked in (IT'S SELF-SERVICE, PLEASE) even though there was no one else in the restaurant and the waiters were milling about.","304":"Nice \"for a change\" sort of place to have lunch. You know the food's good when the lunch crowd is decent despite the out of the way location. We got the prawn mee, which was nice. Not quite as \"strong\" as the soup from the more traditional prawn mee places (e.g. the one at Pepys Road), but things came together well. Would have been nicer if the stock came out piping hot. Desserts are ok.","305":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but this place is great -- really fresh, simply prepared, high quality seafood. Reminded me of trendy places in Boston or San Francisco. Ambience was cool -- quiet, cool music, intimate, slightly hipster. Service was so, so good. We had:- Scallop ceviche style - this was awesome, my favorite of the night. Lemony and garlicky but also light. - Scallop seared - good but the garlic was a bit overpowering on this one- Pumpkin cream soup - really nice and filling, paired well with the garlic flavors of my mains. - Baby squids - overly generous portion, sort of fried but without much seasoning- Barramundi - really flavorful and fresh, with good portion size; could have had this as the main dish only- Noodles - good complement but not necessaryOh my gosh, and the cocktails are amazing. Worth a trip there for the cocktails alone.","306":"The 2 person seafood set at $120 sounds pricey but given the high standard of preparation its not unreasonable:Eat as much as you like beehoon, cooked to perfectionGrilled razor clams, giant sized:)Littleneck clams - some of the sweetest I've hadGrilled shrimp - sweeter than most prawns one getsPan-friedn barramundiGrilled lobster but really it what Aussies like to call a yabbie Blanched kang kong - great way of serving something so familiarA good choice of wine if a short wine list, but should be something for everyone. Red wine was chilled :( minus one star.","307":"I rate the Naked Finn and I will be coming back. I'll state that upfront.I went yesterday night again..drinks with friends from work with bites...Dinner for them, half dinner for me. My rating is 4 stars overall because there are a few misses. Overall still a solid choice and the service was helpful and pleasant.Here's the rundown:Cocktails1) coconut - Yes! I finally got to try it. This was our top pick o the night. They blended the flesh in as well which gave the slushy sorbet a creamier texture. Very coconuty..but you know how some coconuts taste old. This tasted like the sweetest freshest thai coconut had been used. Friends all loved it after tasting mine.2) white peach bellini - friend had this. It was refreshing.3) melon with the hendrick's gin - this was more subtle. melon taste was there but it was definitely less sweet and had a bit of bitterness. I wasn't sure if it was from the rind of the melon but my friend thought it was the gin.4) orange guava cocktail - I had this before so I didn't try. My friend said nice but a bit too sweet. She said her first drink the bellini was better.5) mojito - we all thought this had hardly enough sugar or none in it. My friend asked for sugar syrup to add up. Because of the addition of the orion beer, this was quite a light tasting cocktail. I wouldn't order it again.6) kalamansi - I wanted something sour and this was indeed sour. In fact my friends all made faces when they tried and said it was too much. While I did enjoy it..towards the end I found it too much and I actually left some in the glass. Only if you REALLY like sour. On hindsight I wish I had ordered 2 coconuts hahaFood:1) baby squids - YUMS! Simply grilled, juicy..lots of flavour.2) clams in white wine - needed more white wine. My friends said it was very \"healthy\" and I should have more as I was under the weather.3) cold bee hoon - lightly seasoned, not greasy with a tang of lemon. really nice complement to the food..or just eat it on its own..or drizzle it with the above said clam broth to elevate the clam broth (haha rather than the other way round)4) northern prawns - predominant impression was salty. Gavin did explain they overcook these a bit so the shells can be eaten. I saw another lady eating the big prawns and those looked really juicy which was more the kind of prawns I was expecting.5) razor clams - $12 a piece but surprisingly meaty. fresh and yummy. although they drizzled with shallot oil, it didn't taste oily.Staff were rather busy but responsive. It's a tiny place so it's hard to do a big group unless you book early.","308":"Went here very spontaneously last night for a drink after a long day at work. Had dinner at home..felt something was missing. Naked Finn came to mind. Called them at 11pm and they said the last order for food was past at 10:30pm. I said I'm really just needing a drink and they said last order for that is 11:30 and to come on down.Was a little surprised to see it. Tiny glass house. Loved the look as it was clean and white. I'm a modernist at heart. Felt much roomier than I expected inside but I think that's because it was quiet. They had a long table setup inside with a group and another table in the corner and about 6 chairs along the bar. Bar seats were large and spaced out and it helped I could waltz (stumble?) right in and drag myself straight onto a high chair. Menus were presented. I asked the bartender Gavin what he thought...He explained that basically cocktails there are sorbet based (signature cocktails) and classics which were a lot of South American (Mojitos, capirinhas but with their spin on it).We went back and forth..hey I was only having one drink and I had to make it count. Needed a pick me up. Finally settled on the coconut (note the signature drinks don't have names but have the list of ingredients but they're often called after the first ingredient). I love fresh coconut and he said it was one of their most popular drinks. I was intrigued by the kalamansi and sour prune one as my original thought was refreshing and sour (same brief I gave to Zach at Suprette a few nights ago).Turns out coconut was sold out. Doh! Brother meanwhile was a little impatient waiting for me as he had settled on his \"orange guava\" very quickly (with kronenbourg blanc 1664) while Gavin was very patiently going through the menu with me. Don't get me wrong..he was recommending but I was vacillating (did I spell that right? That was one strong drink! More on that later..)In the end he recommended I go for the pear, the last on the signature list. I did mention the kalamansi sour prune a few times but he didn't dwell on it. I should make it a mission to go back and have that.I had gotten there just before 1130 and with all the discussion on drinks, he said bar snacks were still available and he did check with us later as well before the kitchen started washing up.Ok..verdict. My brother liked his drink very much. I had a taste. We talked about how it was yummy, could definitely taste the orange and guava and it was nicely balanced. My drink was served in a big martini glass all frosted up and it was refreshing and had all the different flavours showing. Gavin showed me the liqueur eau de vie Poire Williams bottle (Menu misspelled it as view I realise now typing this) and asked me to take a sniff, it was peary! He said it was very strong and they only put 5ml in. It said 43% on the bottle. I did a wiki and it's a fruity clear brandy made from Williams or Bartlet pears. Again, I enjoyed that the drink was nicely balanced and tasty and you could also taste the cucumber which was the last ingredient (cucumber infused vodka).Had a nice chat with Gavin, he was from Barstories previously. I said I would be back and would try to bring my friend who had brought me to Barstories before. He explained the name from the book Great Expectations and said they would do a movie screening of the same later in January.Drinks were mostly $18 or $20, no service charge but add GST . Must have been stronger than I thought coz I had the one drink in a big martini glass and I had to concentrate very slightly to walk straight haha! I looked at food menu. All seafood. They had a platter for 1 at $88 or a platter for 2 \u00c2\u00a0at $128 which they recommended as they said going ala carte is less food for more money.We were the last in..first out. I just needed something easy on a whim and we got that so 5 stars for the experience, friendliness and drinks. We had parked on the grass edge outside which assisted in the waltzing in and out.Easy parking. checkEasy stress-free experience. checkYummy cold drink for $20. checkFriendly patient bartender. checkPicked me up. check","309":"Look, the big tip for this place is to listen to what they are pimping that evening and order that. There are no two ways when it comes to seafood. You can't do anything if the produce is below par, and with their minimal cooking methods they can't risk it either. We (over)ordered an extra fish that the restaurant \u00c2\u00a0was not recommending and it took the edge off an otherwise good meal.Other than that, YES, do visit, keep the ordering sane, have a cocktail or a nice craft beer and enjoy the evening and the peaceful surroundings. I'm coming back.","310":"Since dining almost 2 years ago, The Naked Finn has moved to new premises, barely 100 meters away from their old haunt, which is, incidentally, now its sister bar. Its greenhouse aesthetic is maintained, so you get an expansive view of the lush surrounds of Gillman Barracks. It's a terrific escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Be sure to make reservations though, it was a busy full house on a Friday afternoon when we popped by for lunch.Very little is done to the seafood, which is fresh and sweet. If you thought that read bland food, you'd be mightily mistaken. The food here is hearty and soulful, and robust with flavour. It's just that when the ingredient's that fresh and sweet, very little needs to be done to it.We had:1) Grilled Indian Baby Squid ($8) - seasoned simply with a flick of sea salt and slick of olive oil: must try. Soft, sweet and succulent2) Beef Burger ($23): At first blush, it looked disappointingly minuscule. But (some, not all) good things come in small packages, and this turned out an indulgent, finger-licking-good powerhouse. The decadent grass-fed dry-aged Japanese wagyu patty, dripping with juices, came together with the Boston lettuce, American cheese, and special sauce brilliantly. Just be sure to get double (or triple) orders of this if you're hungry.3) Pan-fried Barramundi Fillet ($20): paper-crisp skin and moist flaky meat. This was seasoned with olive oil and finished with sea salt, accompanied by a mound of blanched kangkong tossed in kalamansi juice, dried shrimp, and shallot oil, and vermicelli oiled in sesame and fried garlic bits, both served refreshingly chilled4) Hae Mee Tng ($25): a medley of farmed giant tiger prawns, Salmon Creek Farms pork belly, in a blended soup of 9 prawn species and simmered pork bones. This was rich and sweet but not cloying, as The Naked Finn resists the addition of MSG or sugar. Get the vermicelli for a traditional option, or the Japanese somen for a twist on the classic. 5) Homemade Naked Chendol ($13) with coconut sorbet: deconstructed version of a local classic, but refreshingly lovely6) Homemade Gula Melaka Sorbet with Sea Salt ($10): a twist on the flavour du jour, salted caramel. An absolute must-try.7) Homemade Sour Plum Sorbet ($10) with osmanthus jelly: recommended if you prefer a tangy refreshing end to your meal","311":"It is a hide away from the hectic city. A delightful cocktail bar with simple honest dishes. I enjoy the flavorful concoctions along with their seasonal changes. The boys do a great job at introducing you with the menu. They are also brilliantly smart at pairings and precise with measurements, so if you have the time and right company, sit by the bar for a nice show. Their bee hoon is a must. I only say this because I have a weakness for spicy food and they spoil me with four different types of chilies. Life can't get better. Yes it is out of the way, but that is the pleasure of being there. Keep up the great work guys.","312":"Been to this restaurant three times now and love the food. It's located in the lively Smith Street of Chinatown.","313":"I walked into the Smith Street Chinatown food court fully expecting the highlight to be the globally acclaimed Hawker Chan, so you can imagine my surprise when I found they were bested by neighbor Zhong Guo La Mian and their Spicy Wontons. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Like Hawker Chan, there's almost always a line in front of Zhong Guo La Mian, but I was pleased to find on a Saturday lunch hour that the wait was less than twenty minutes. Once you're up front, your order comes out in no more than five minutes. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$5 SGD for ten Spicy Szechuan Wontons might have felt a bit more expensive than some of the other stalls, but this was at the end of the day a screaming deal given these are made fresh to order essentially right in front of you. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?These spicy wontons were excellent, and my only regret was that I didn't also order the XLB. You had great filler encased in a smooth skin that really lapped up the spicy chili oil. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Definitely. Star.","314":"Food: 2.5\/5.0Service: 2.0\/5.0Value: 3.0\/5.0Decor: 1.5\/5.0Overall: 2.5\/5.0Everyone wants to be a hipster, and that means taking really mediocre food in dingy stalls and talking it up like it's some gift from above. \u00c2\u00a0Lets get real, these are at best decent XLB for a hawker stall, but even trying to compare these to DTF is absolute fake news. \u00c2\u00a0The non-XLB items are completely mediocre (read: ugh). \u00c2\u00a0Pass.","315":"All-in-all, Din Tai Fung still wins in my opinion, as I prefer the flavor of the DTF xiao long bao filling. The skin here was somewhat inconsistent, and if you weren't very delicate and careful, it would break, letting the soup leak out. Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar.","316":"In terms of hawker xlb this would be one of the good ones. I still think the soup should be more oily and sticky. The skin is correct. I suppose so far din tai fung will be the most authentic although a bit \" too clean\" in flavor. For the price I think you get your money's worth. 6 for 10.","317":"Kreta Ayer market is just a labyrinth on the second floor, chocked full of food gems to be discovered. One such example, Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao.As in the namesake, you should get an order of the xiao long baos. At 10 for $5, they're a good deal, and while a little less refined than the ones from Din Tai Fung, these feel more homely and very satisfying. The soup dumplings are really juicy and the broth has good flavor. They often make the dumplings to order so there might a be a little wait as they prepare the dumplings and place them right into the steamer. It's totally worth it though.","318":"Best XLB in #Singapore is found at Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao in Chinatown. #1 the steamed mini buns... basically pork dumplings but the fat from pork melts out of the meat into the bun and is kinda soupy in the buns... OH MY GOD! So good!!!!!!! #illeatforyou #XLB","319":"The only place I've ever tried XLB was at Din Tai Fung in Seattle. Even though others love it, I never thought it was that good and just assumed XLB was supposed to be that way. My views on XLB changed after going to Zhong Guo La Mian. For about $4.50 USD you get 10 amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed XLB that packs so much amazing flavor that you'll crave for months. If I can find a way back to Singapore, this spot is a must stop.","320":"Wildly delicious and exceptionally convenient - XLBs will be the end of me. \u00c2\u00a0I will move into the Chinatown Complex and find refuge with Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao. \u00c2\u00a0There is something uniquely satisfying about eating dumplings prepared before your eyes. \u00c2\u00a0It's nostalgic....a taste of innocence. \u00c2\u00a0One bite and they'll have you. \u00c2\u00a0They'll \u00c2\u00a0own your time and your wallet. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0While I am reluctant to admit this kind of uncouth behavior, I can devour 30 dumplings in one sitting! \u00c2\u00a0;-)","321":"Xiao Long Bao in my opinion better than Din Tai Fung and cheaper. 10 for $5.50. The xlb are tasty and soupy. Made fresh in front of you and served steaming hot :) I appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients yet the complexity of the flavors. Such a simple dish but so tasty. I'll definitely be back. Others were also ordering the Szechuan dumplings or wonton which looked really good too.","322":"It's not bad. But I dont think it's gonna win any awards soon. I ordered the szechuan spicy noodles and pan fried dumplings.You cant order half portion for the dumplings. So it's all or nothing. The dumplings are good, but I've had better. But for hawker centre standards.. 7\/10.The noodles has a peanut sauce base, but it was lacking in dimensions. About 6\/10 not a big fan, but it was decent.I was just too lazy to queue for the other award winning stalls.... I'll come back to try their xiao long bao next time","323":"Good, solid xlb that can satisfy any craving with the additional delight of having paid just $5.50 for 10 dumplings!! Found this on Yelp and no regrets about trying it. I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung. My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it. Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal. It makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap can't be found easily in the US :( P.S I gotta try this Good Beer Company everyone's mentioning :p P.P.S. The store is #02-135 for those struggling to find it as I did: it's near the edge of the complex! And across from Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken store of Michelin fame.","324":"This place does different types of dumplings and some noodles as well. I sampled the dumplings and they are pretty decent, not that they are amazing in any way but the pan-fried dumplings are good and 10 for 5.5 SGD is a good deal.The line was not long when I was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place I could consider returning to.","325":"I have eaten at this establishment a few times now and usually I just walk up to the counter and order a batch of freshly made xiao long baos, but today was a good 10 minutes wait. Not that I'm complaining, it was totally worth it! The wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love. So I'm not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy - I know, I know, don't lynch me! - it's just my preference (and don't get me started on those tang baos). But don't get me wrong, the meat filling isn't dry by any means. I find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin. For a little variety try them in different combination of sauces (soy or vinegar only, and mixed) and with\/without ginger. Try with ketchup ... ok, just kidding. The other nice thing is the reasonable price of $5.50\/10 pieces, come on. Great taste for a great price, go give this place a try.","326":"We had to come here twice because the first time, they weren't open. It was 3pm so make sure to not come then. The second time we came at 515pm and they were open for business. I ordered the XLB and spicy pork dumplings. Both were super delicious. The couple owners were so nice and helpful too. They made me feel very welcomed at their food stand.","327":"Ya, if they were open.... so disappointing that I had to settle for Hawker Chan but it should be a good alternative.... yelp didn't show that this is closed though.....hope to try it again soon but for now is 1 star...","328":"I cheer for the underdogs. Well, 99% of the time...only because 1% seriously should stay that way.I typically spit at the favored ones. Well, nearly 99% of the time because they tend to get over-hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable. After all, the endless banter causes your brain to think they are PERFECT because of how they are marketed right?This probably explains my utter distaste towards Din Tai Feng (especially the two overcrowded spots in LA that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area). Don't get me wrong, they are decent. Quite good at best...but nothing mind-blowing. So when people keep saying that Din Tai Feng is the ONLY to-go spot for GOOD dumplings...bile begins to form in my mouth.Fast-forward to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao...you'll find two very friendly and hardworking PRCs (wanted to say Chinese guys but changed it PRC to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking AWESOME; they should be culinary ambassadors) kneading dough and forming Xiao Long Baos (hereafter, XLBs) one after the other with their magical fingers. They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"\/Definitely-recommendNOTE: I've had it 5 times so far (20-30 each time) and the best time is usually dinner after a long line. Why? I went at lunch and my 20 XLBs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones I've had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made.Yelp 100: 36\/100","329":"I can confirm the other reviews are accurate! \u00c2\u00a0GREAT dumplings. \u00c2\u00a0Cheap. \u00c2\u00a0Worth a trip.","330":"$5 for 10, whether it be xiao long bao, guo tie, boiled dumplings or steamed ones.I was meeting Jireh H and Amanda L for a drink at Good Beer Company. I was early and craving dumplings, decided to walkabout to survey the offerings. Started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them. Finally found the dumpling shop run by 2 cheery China guys.I started with an order of boiled dumplings. Once the others took a taste, they started really getting into it. We ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie.The xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it, I think it's Chinese wine. These and the pot stickers (guo tie) seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders. I prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as I find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying. The dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside. People were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes.I give 5 stars not because these are the best I've ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price. There's also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot. You can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting..free entertainment!","331":"After an hour into waiting in line for one of two Michelin star food stalls, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle, we decided to pick up some soup dumplings to tie us over. The dumplings were fresh (they actually make them in front of you), juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin. These were better than any that I've had at Din Tai Fung or any other soup dumpling restaurant, and it was only $6 for 10. Definitely worth checking out while you're in Chinatown.","332":"My first time trying Tim Ho Wan was in Sydney three years ago and I fell in love instantaneously. Being from the USA, I was super excited to see so many THW locations in Singapore. This one in CityLink is the closest to Marina Bay Sands, where we were staying.No wait for lunch, surprisingly, and our meal did not disappoint. Everything is so tasty but my two favorite things are the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Steamed Egg Cake. So good that we ordered a second round for both! The only thing that I'd skip next time would be the egg tarts; I've definitely had better elsewhere.Pricey for dim sum, but completely worth it (at least once), in my opinion.","333":"Very good and affordable dim sum place. If you come during tea time, between lunch and dinner, you get a wide selection of dishes for $3.8 which is a steal!The chashabao is crafted beautifully, crunchy, sweet and also savory. Gotta love the combination of textured and flavors. The shaomai and other dumplings don't skimp out on meat and shrimp, and the flavor is very consistent throughout the dishes.Only downside is no outside drinks, and that service can be a little rough at times. Also charging for hand towels seems a little too old fashioned and annoying.","334":"I went to Tim Ho Wan for dim sum lunch. I ordered a bunch of dishes so here are some highlights: The prawn dumplings were pretty good, the pork siewmai was very tasty, the steamed egg cake is a nice light and fluffy consistency, the pork rice rolls were fine, the Hong Kong style egg tarts were some of the best I've had, and the mango sago was refreshing.The service speed is fast. The prices are okay for this type of dim sum food. There is a decent amount of seating, though not as much as in most dim sum places.Overall, Tim Ho Wan has solid Cantonese dim sum food. I initially came here because I read that it got a Michelin star, but after eating there, I didn't feel like it was really that exceptional. Still, if you are interested in tasty dim sum, Tim Ho Wan is a very good choice.","335":"So I passed this place due to the iPhone not giving good directions. Once I finally made all I can say was yummy......I wondered the shrimp dumplings, spinach and shrimp dumplings, chicken spring rolls which are fried, the fried milk custard and also the braised beef noodle soup. Everything was delicious. I should have ordered more. The only thing that I did not care for was the braised beef noodle soup. It wasn't what I expect has far as flavor. Even when adding sauces to it, it just wasn't tasty at all. One Michelin Star of yummy greatness! Check it out","336":"One Michelin Star for an inexpensive dim sum restaurant? Alright. \u00c2\u00a0This one was located just off the City Hall MRT station in Singapore and seemed to have the best rating and review on yelp.I ordered a bunch of dishes with my niece and her friends and here it goes. \u00c2\u00a0The bbq pork bun was baked not steamed but it was very good. \u00c2\u00a0The bread layer was pretty thin and there was a substantial amount of bbq pork filling. \u00c2\u00a0There was an air gap but it all just seemed to be in the right proportions. \u00c2\u00a0The har gau or shrimp dumpling was also very good. \u00c2\u00a0They had a small wonton noodle dish that was also good and they had these green skinned wonton like it was made from spinach. \u00c2\u00a0In fact most of it compared very well with some of the best dim sum I have ever had. \u00c2\u00a0Maybe not a Michelin star but close. \u00c2\u00a0Prices compared with those in California so no complaints.I will be back again to try some of the other dishes. Go try it!","337":"We had a light lunch today. The fried rice, veggie dumplings, and shumai were good beyond our expectation. Service was really prompt and no gimmicks. We got what we wanted at no time. After lunch just brought the order sheet to the cashier and pay. That's it. Really nice! $$$","338":"In 2011 summer, I lined up like everyone else did in front of the original Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong, it got a Michelin Star that year, dubbed as the cheapest Michelin, in fact.I took the opportunity to try it one last time in 2012 but ultimately it became an impossible task as the fan base was growing. So it expanded. I heard the New York outpost is lackluster. But I don't get to come to Singapore often enough and it's right inside the hotel, so it felt appropriate to try. It was a hot and humid 82 degree weather and I didn't want to go outdoors.Turns out the place was half empty. I got a nice seat and ordered what was popular. the BBQ pork buns, the chicken feet, the ribs, etc. Try to stay carb free by eating the fillings only. The verdict is that it's good, but not as good as circa 2011 in Hong Kong after its receipt of the Michelin. Still, I like my nostalgia and familiarity. \u00c2\u00a0A good find.","339":"Suprised to see this michelin star dim sum at underground mrt walkway in singapore - realized they have many locations. Their turnip cake was a serious disappointment- it was pure white radish , not hot and no toppings inside. The famous bbq bun was good - but a little too sweet & salty - good amount of filling.","340":"Really great dim sum place but then again they're famous for that.The place is rather small since it's located inside a mall, but the service is fast and so is table turnover. We were lucky that we got a seat right away during a lunch rush hour.Everything on the table was delicious and satisfying. Great price and great dim sum.","341":"Ever since Tim Ho Wan has opened in NYC, I have always wanted to go - but knew that there were always long lines. So ironically enough, I end up in Singapore and realize that many of the globally-recognized dim sum spots that are delicious (Tim Ho Wan, too many Din Tai Fungs to count) appear to be here - and this one being in the mall right next to the hotel we are staying! It doesn't get any better than rolling out for breakfast right when Tim Ho Wan opens at 10:30 AM, and there is no line or wait to speak of! We got seated quickly, our food came out quickly, and while the service wasn't personable, you aren't coming here because you expect to be treated like a king.I finally got to see what all the hype was about, especially the pork buns....holy cow is all I can say. I've had some good pork buns, and there's a really good cheap spot in NYC Chinatown that I love, but the buns here are by far the best I've had. The roll is a little sweet but not that thick at all, and the pork inside is deliciously savory. If I had more time in Singapore (and more stomach space), I would probably grab an order of these to go every day. The rest of the dim sum was pretty good as well; I particularly liked the pork ribs served in black bean sauce, as the sauce was a much lighter version (I was expecting the ribs to be drenched in a heavy marinade) and made each bite less heavy, but just as flavorful. The bean curd skin was juicy and moist, and the shumai was fresher and less dry than most other versions I have encountered elsewhere, although the flavor was not necessarily any more distinctive.In all, I get the hype when it comes to the buns. The rest of the food is quite good as well. It's basically a more premium, better-prepared version of dim sum, but if you can get in, I understand why folks really love the food here and are willing to wait for it. The takeout line here is a plus for sure, in the event that you are on the go.","342":"This is one of the better location of Tim Ho Wan, comparing to the ones in the States and Vietnam. The prices do not differ much at each place, remaining quite reasonable and even low for such quality of food and service. 3 years ago I got driven here by a taxi driver after asking for a good place for dim sum in Singapore and was told it won a Michelin star. I was not disappointed at all. The dishes were of good taste and high quality. Besides the basic dishes like har gow of shu mai, their specialities are excellent. My must order dish for every visit is the one (I don't remember the name) topped with wasabi sauce and roe. Sometimes they have seasonals, and during winter time they made a \u00c2\u00a0delicious mini har gow dish made to be eaten with Sichuan peppercorns sauce. For such a famous and busy place, food got served surprisingly quickly and still piping hot. I definitely recommend everyone to check it out if you're a big fan of dim sum.","343":"Impressive line up of savory dim sum.Place is really good for a dim sum experience.Its one of the good dim sum places Ive ever been.","344":"Food: 4.0\/5.0Service: 2.0\/5.0Value: 3.0\/5.0Decor: 2.5\/5.0Overall: 3.5\/5.0The dim sum here was very good but not mind blowing. \u00c2\u00a0The baked BBQ pork buns in particular were very popular (I thought they were good but not as much as some of the others at my table did). \u00c2\u00a0Try coming later in the day to avoid long lines. \u00c2\u00a0Look forward to trying the original(s) in Hong Kong that actually garnered the perhaps politicized M*(s).","345":"The dim sum is good, but the location is stark and the service is really poor. \u00c2\u00a0It reminds me of a dirty middle school cafeteria: think mash potatoes 'slop and plop' by the old woman with the hairnet - all that's missing is the cigarette hanging from her mouth. \u00c2\u00a0Yet another example of what Singapore is willing to tolerate for restaurant settings.","346":"This is just a review for their pick up counter. But yes. It's awesome. So. Good. Ordered the following: BBQ pork buns (3 buns, $5.60 SGD)Pan fried carrot(radish) cake (3 pieces, $5.30)Beancurd Skin w\/Shrimp (3 rolls, $6.40)Hong Kong style egg tart (Buy 3 get one free, $4.80)I was walking through Raffles place, and just sat down on a bench and started eating, because they do recommend that you eat the BBQ buns within an hour. \u00c2\u00a0Boy am I glad I started eating early. What is so outstanding about this dim sum is that the main ingredients really shine through in terms of flavor. As amazing as the crust is for the BBQ buns, the pork is actually the star. The radish flavor of the cakes were so noticeable (in a good way) that it make you feel like their radishes were fresh! The beancurd skin was crispy, and had a balanced amount of filling- not too little nor too much. Just right. That's when you know you've got good dim sum. Everything tastes just right. No heavy feeling after eating it (I basically ate all of that in an afternoon and felt fine).","347":"Cha Siew Bao must try.The Cha Siew Bao is so good that my gf get a nose bleed when she eats it. So get those tissues ready.The pork liver vermicelli roll is pretty good, but personally I think something is missing in there. The next best favourite would be the chicken feet! Tender and fat, well marinated and tasty down to the bones.We had the chew siew noodles and the glutinous rice, both fills the tummy with its sizeable portion.The tonic medlar jelly dessert with wolfberries is a delight. $40 for two pax. Reasonable.","348":"The dim sum was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked except for the Ya chow fried rice which was bland.","349":"Well I loveeeeeee eating at Tim Ho Wan only if there's no queue!This is the 6th outlet in Singapore and I chanced upon it while on my way to another restaurant (which I gave up!). No queue during weekend dinner hour (YAY)!Surprised to see new additions on the menu at this outlet that is pretty much adjusted to fit local taste buds. Laksa wanton and chilli crab taro dumpling.We ordered 2\/4 of their \u00e5\u009b\u009b\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e5\u00a4\u00a9\u00e7\u008e\u008b (Big 4 Heavenly Kings) Baked BBQ pork bun and pork liver vermicelli roll, pork congee and century egg & salted egg, beancurd skin with shrimp and chilli crab taro dumpling. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, except for the beancurd skin with shrimp. We really enjoy pork liver cooked just right, something that is really hard to find in Singapore, consistency of those baked bbq pork bun which they maintained for all their franchise stalls, well balanced pork congee that is not too salty, and that really tasty chilli crab taro dumpling that is fried perfectly with a punch of fire after the chilli crab gets down to my stomach. I felt that there was no need for any sauces throughout the meal.The beancurd skin with shrimp (the fried dish, not to be confused with the steamed version) was a little disappointing for me though, as it's too oily (not at least served on an oil filter paper), very little shrimp and the texture is rather mushy, and the portion is small. I would have opt for the option of beancurd skin with pork and shrimp instead (the steamed version). Totally not worth $6 for those 3 tiny pieces.This outlet has password protected wifi, but when I asked the staff, he mentioned that they are not make known the password to the wifi. So dang, no wifi here.Paid about $32 for this meal to satisfy 2 tummy! It's still worth it for the great quality of the food and services.","350":"Great Dim Sum - fast efficient service. The pork buns were probably the best I've had. Has a fast food feel to it but very attentive wait staff.","351":"Only giving this place a 3 Star and not 4 because it's not traditional dim sum I'm use to. They hand you a sheet and you order from it. The dim sum was okay. Not the best I've had nor the worst. It was nice for a quick snack in between meals.","352":"The brunch of brunches! Not cheap, but unlimited Veuve Cliquot champagne, a fantastic gin & tonic bar and endless amounts of high quality delicacies more than make up for it. Went during Halloween and everything was decorated - mummies, scary ice sculptures and Halloween themed deserts (think brain cupcakes). Food quality was very good - had everything from forearm-sized crab legs and a variety of oysters to a flavorful Indian dishes and Chinese dumplings. Ambiance - it is nice restaurant, but you can tell that it is located in a hotel and designed to house a large brunch buffet. Overall fantastic, but like a lot of things in Singapore on the pricey side (~$200 per person).","353":"I had a great brunch experience here. This really puts American \"champagne\" brunches to shame. A lot of the champagne brunches in Singapore use legit quality champagne, which makes it so much nicer. Edge also has a gin & tonic bar, which is dangerous but also amazing. And the staff were very attentive to keeping my champagne glass full and didn't cut us off until they were closing. For the G&T, we picked a Japanese gin, and the guy who made it up added some citrus things. Given how expensive alcohol, especially liquor, is in Singapore, this definitely makes the price seem acceptable. I was so so happy with the seafood station, and the stations with the Asian\/Indian food. The king crab, tuna, and salmon, duck, scallop dumplings, the satays \u00c2\u00a0The highlight would have to be the generous amount of seared foie gras that was served over churros. Mind-blowing. The reason this gets 4 stars is because some of grilled meat options were meh - the wagyu beef and lamb could be better. But then the dessert section ended it strong. The macaroons were memorable. Next time I'm in Singapore, I'd definitely come back.","354":"This place is the Meka of breakfast buffets. It has all variety of nationalities, fresh and clean. They had fresh fruit, veggies and cheese. They made coffee and juice to order. It is pricy but worth it","355":"This place is the Meka of breakfast buffets. It has all variety of nationalities, fresh and clean. They had fresh fruit, veggies and cheese. They made coffee and juice to order. It is price but worth it","356":"We were really looking forward to this buffet experience but we were extremely disappointed and felt that there were better way to spend our money. We went during their thanksgiving fest dinner which cost more than usual. The selection wasn't great and the food sucked. I tried their prime beef steak and it was so tough that I could not finish. Laksa was tasteless, roast pork skin was not crispy even though we were the first ones there. The dessert selection was limited, their expensive log cake was soggy.I must say I walked out of a buffer feeling hungry. Don't waste your money here.","357":"Sunday brunch is magical. Bottomless Veuve Clicqout, a live band, a balloon magician. Edge - you nailed it. \u00c2\u00a0The fresh seafood selection was astonishing. The live stations were amazing. \u00c2\u00a0The service was attentive. I highly recommend Edge for your next Sunday brunch.","358":"So this is going to be my shortest review ever ! I think everybody's heard enough about the food and the spread and the ambience already. And I'm not going to disagree with any of the other reviews about the edge, because the food, the spread and the ambience are just as good as everybody says it is. I just want to say something about service leadership at edge. In reviewing the service at the edge, I will say one thing: the team in charge of service wants you to have a seamlessly extraordinary experience. In fact, I'll go one better and \u00c2\u00a0say that they seem to take it personally!Here's just one example. We ordered a dish of curried chicken that was part of buffet but off their usual menu. This didn't arrive, and it truly wasn't a big deal given all the food \u00c2\u00a0we didn't end up trying; just not humanly possible or healthy to in my opinion. \u00c2\u00a0The concierge not satisfied with more than just the usual apologies, \u00c2\u00a0made sure to leave us with a small token of appreciation. It certainly cost them next to nothing but bought my admiration and loyalty forever. Service at this level may be something that is usual stateside, but so very unusual in Singapore and so very refreshing to see!! \u00c2\u00a0 There will be those who point to the less than responsive service of the floor staff, but I'm happy to overlook it if the service leadership team is so committed to good service that they take it personally. \u00c2\u00a0If this is the attitude of leadership, slow service staff and another practical details will work themselves out over time. \u00c2\u00a0I will continue to give them my custom as long as that is the case! \u00c2\u00a0Kudos concierge team at edge!!","359":"Truly enjoyed Sunday brunch at the Edge... I liked how the food was fresh and plentiful, a wide selection so you're not at a loss for choice. The quality and the service was great. It seems that a lot of people are more interested in drinking than eating but that also meant our glasses were always topped up and we didn't have to fight or queue for the popular items as you would at other buffets. Don't recall how much it was as my friends took me out but I would definitely recommend if you are looking for value for money and a more classy buffet.","360":"Edge breakfast buffet was awesome. We enjoyed all the variety of foods. Malay, Chinese, Japanese, American, Indian and more I'm sure. Best of all that everything was fresh and delicious. I highly recommend it.","361":"Been here around 5 times as my family loves this buffet. The quality and variety of the food is consistent. Decent food with a variety of the usual-seafood, dim sum on certain days, various Singaporean dishes including laksa, chicken rice and other foods that can be found over Singapore. Despite the raving reviews, I found myself kinda disappointed with the spread-nothing much exciting or special that made it worth its price. What makes this worth a trip would be the dessert bar, filled with ice cream, more than 10 types of cakes, pudding and all including meringues, cr\u00c3\u00a8me brulee, pandan cake, nyonya kueh, waffles and more. The service is good but not exceptional. Overall, this buffet might appeal to those hungry for specific types of food in mind and are particular about the quality. Not a personal favourite but probably worth a try if you're in the vicinity or staying at the hotel","362":"The spread at Edge definitely trumped the one at Rise. I really enjoyed the waffle counter because, 1) waffles, 2) they made it fresh! So it came out hot and toasty.Good ambience, and good wine.","363":"wow, what a crazy good buffet. came here a few times when having meetings in the Pan Pacific.so many stations! lots of fresh seafood, shellfish and sushi. soups, italian food, asian noodles, fresh fruit and an amazing dessert stop that was like a pastry, chocolate and ice cream store all rolled into one","364":"the food was decent. I don't think it was outstanding in any of the criteria we judge buffets by: quantity, quality, variety, and service - but it's good enough to return to, just to differentiate itself from the main players (to my mind: melt, the line, and straits kitchen).they have the usual roundup of local food, japanese sushi and sashimi (the latter is good and very generous - ask for the salmon belly, which is available via request and not on display). the cold seafood seems serviceable (they have oysters and crab legs, which I know many people are into), but my favorite was definitely the prime roast - pink, tender, and full of flavour. pity they don't serve au jus.I also want to warn you that their so-named barbecue is in fact an indoor table-top grill, where you place your orders for various cuts of meat. not what I'd named a barbecue (and I'll refrain from judging this insidious clever marketing) - and also not very good. highly by-passable.there's a good spread of dessert, with a chocolate fountain, artisan-looking chocolates, and pretty cakes. skip the waffles though - anaemic, and rather biscuity, these are serviceable only with the ice cream.not bad enough to warn against - but if you're into stuffing your face, I'd recommend you to melt (still my favorite) and the line (which is an oldie but decent-ee).","365":"The food was good, don't get me wrong, but I'm rating this place 3 stars because I think it lacks value. I think there was way too much food to try, and not enough tummy space. If you are looking for a good spread for dessert, this is not your place. It's more of a main course kind of place.I came here for dinner. They had an impressive spread of seafood, including lobsters. There was an array of Indian foods, which were quite good, and Chinese food (I liked the soup), Western styled dishes, and grill etc. I can't quite remember everything. Everything was cooked well. My only issue is that you can try maybe one bite of half the items, and you're done with dinner. I think I would have been happier with a smaller spread with a smaller price tag.Lastly, we came here for work with a guest. Their credit card machine was not working, and they asked us to wait a little while they rebooted. We ended up waiting for 30 min, which was really embarrassing. I think they should have let us pay at the next door restaurant, or use the credit card machine at the reception. Given the size of the bill, there was no way we could have carried enough cash to pay for it, but that way the only option we were given for payment.-------------Update: March 25, 2017We are doing a buffet tour of Singapore, and came back to the Edge for lunch last weekend. Lunch price was $48, but we used a UOB credit card for a 20% discount. I think they have restructured the buffet because I recall it used to be more expensive (although I checked during the holidays, so there might have been additional charges). I believe the addition of local delights means that the food is cheaper to make, so they were able to reduce the price and still please the crowd. I was here for dinner the last time, so I can't tell exactly what was changed because of the meal, and what was changed to deal with the price. The grill station is gone. They had a teh tarik station. There was a pizza station, a pasta station, kueh pie ti station, Indian, and local\/Chinese station. There was chilled seafood (mussels and prawns), and sashimi. There was a fried banana station, and maybe a kaya toast station (although I didn't see anyone get it), and a bunch of local kuehs at another station. Yeah, they definitely replaced a few things.The dessert station is improved since the last time I was here. I particularly liked their ice cream -- they had 5 flavors. There was a yuzu sorbet, a blueberry yogurt, Thai milk tea, and matcha, and I can't remember the last one. I didn't like the yuzu. The blueberry yogurt was okay. I liked their Thai milk tea ice cream. The waffles were pre-made, and red velvet flavored only. I skipped that. The cakes didn't blow my mind. They had a bunch of kuehs, and Portuguese egg tarts. \u00c2\u00a0With the change in the variety of food, I think the buffet is now better value (less variety, but also lower priced). I think the quality of the food wasn't spectacular, but acceptable. I might bump this to 3.5 stars.","366":"Exceptional and tasty. Really enjoyed the selection and the food was quite delicious. My only qualm is the juice bar. Where's the fresh squeezed anything??","367":"I admit that most of the food I had in Singapore was not as good as I was hoping, but every morning I got up 7 kinds of excited for 7 different countries of food.I stayed at Pan Pacific while I was in Singapore, and I made sure I was up every morning, even on my days off, to go downstairs and enjoy the Edge buffet. I'm not even a buffet person, preferring to just sit and relax and have things brought to me, but I wanted everything they offered, so it was better for me to just go get it.All the traditional western breakfast foods: pancakes, waffles, bacon, omelettes, sausage, etc. They also had a cold bar with yogurt, fruit, cheese, and cereal. The bakery was amazing, and I had pretty much everything they offered at some point during the week. There was also Indian, Malay, Chinese, and Japanese. A coffee and juice bar allowed for plenty of beverage options as well. The cost was high but included in my room package, so it didn't bother me at all.If I go back to Singapore, I'm staying at Pan Pacific and enjoying this buffet every morning.","368":"Located on the 3rd flr, Edge is a restaurant inside the Pan Pacific hotel. My review is based on service during breakfast hour, as breakfast was included with my stay. Similar to other hotels in Singapore catering to international travelers, edge offers diners plenty of choices during breakfast service. All stations are buffet-style, serving foods common in Europe\/American (sweet pastry, croissants, baked beans, eggs, bacon & sausage, etc.), to Asia (congee, dim sum, noodles soup, fried noodles, fried rice, naan, yogurt, sushi, etc.) to deli & cheese station, fresh fruit station (pineapple, watermelon, papaya, dragon fruits). They also have a couple stations offering cook-to-order dishes, like omelettes, or fish-ball or wonton noodle soup. The servers are fairly attentive in clearing the empty plate and refilling tea or coffee. But they're not overly intrusive (i was able to enjoy my meal without being interrupted every 5 min). I think for juices, you have to full those yourself at that juice station. You gets a small orange\/black card on the table that tells the staff whether you \u00c2\u00a0just getting more food or you're done. So you don't have to worry about someone accidentally clearing you table.As mentioned my breakfast was included with my stay, so I don't know how much breakfast is at the edge. That said, food was good, service was good... If I have to pay out of pocket, I would prob pay around $25SGD... Simply because there are a lot of local places you can find similar food for less money, though may not be at one convenient location. Or you have a huge appetite that you require buffet-style feeding. :)","369":"There's plenty of wonderful high-end international buffets around here, but so far, I'd have to say this is one of the best international buffet restaurants I've been to. Even as you walk in, the ambience is wonderful, with a spacious seating plan. There's a selection of window seating, booths and regular restaurant seating available, with the food stations spaced out rather evenly throughout the restaurant. There's a large selection of cuisines available, with a small variety of dishes representing each cuisine. Unlike other buffets, these dishes are prepared in small quantities to ensure the quality and freshness of each dish. There's also an absolutely wonderful selection of fresh in-season fruits, cheeses and desserts - I highly recommend the red wine chocolate! Service by the staff was also pretty good - there were smiles all around. My brother also managed to get a birthday candle for the slice of cheesecake he picked up from the dessert counter which he had decorated with more chocolates from the counter (it was my birthday). Would definitely recommend this place :)","370":"Lovely selecting of breakfast foods from across the globe. A little disappointed the Sashimi\/Sushi station has disappeared recently, but none the less, still a good start to the day (if you can control yourself from overeating!).","371":"On 11 January I had lunch at the top recommended buffet at Edge. The food and service was good for a 5star category restaurant. Unfortunately having around 50percent occupancy lots of the items were out, and there weren't any refills in 15 minutes.","372":"This place is definitely a must try for buffet hunters. Highly recommended:i) widest spread of food in Singaporeii) fresh seafoodiii) tasty foodiv) competitively pricedCan't go wrong if you are a big eater.","373":"Well, Yelp never lets me down. Came to Vatos for dinner after needing a break from hawker stalls so I browsed Yelp and that's where we ended up.My bf and I shared 3 orders of two tacos each- the beef brisket, pork belly, and fish tacos. They were all very delicious and although the taco tortilla appeared small, they were stacked to the sky with protein. It's not a very traditional Mexican place- because those places usually do two tortillas per taco, but I enjoyed these tacos thoroughly and I would come back if I ever visited Singapore again!","374":"This place is stashed away in the dip but conveniently located in the Beach Road complex which is a Beautiful creation and area to stay and play in. We were greeted promptly and seated promptly. The menu was easy to read and the space is great as well as the music and shall I say the entertainment which I deemed as entertaining by way of the chef cooking and dancing to \"Despasito\" he had tons of rhythm. Once I dig into the menu I was so excited to see that they had Vegan options. My Vegan tacos were super yummy, my husband had shrimp and chicken tacos which he loved. Our son had cheese quesadilla and he ate it all. My sister in law had shrimp tacos with pico on the side. She enjoyed, we all were very fond of the House chip and dip as it was fresh and the red sauce was super flavorful and my favorite of the two provided as we received a green sauce as well that our toddler liked since it was not as spicy. This place is a must do when in Singapore especially if you are a VIP member of my travel club as we earn travel upon paying our tab. WIN WIN WIN","375":"Who knew I would be drinking a beer from Northern California Brewery eating Asian\/Mexican fusion food in Singapore? I thought it was awesome they had Lost Coast Brewery's stout as a beer option here. If I'm going to pay Singapore prices for alcohol, might as well be a craft beer, right? The Korean Po'boy was pretty filling. Loved the house chips here. Pretty huge but with the green was bomb.","376":"Ugh, it's just about average. Food can be a little dry and staff pretty disengaged. Quite loud inside, really hard to hold a conversation.","377":"Vatos Urban Tacos knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to authentic Mexican tacos!I gotta say that I was a little hesitant to go for tacos in Singapore. I mean, if I sometimes can't find good tacos in the USA, which is just north of the border from Mexico. How was I going to find real tacos in Singapore? ...But I was WRONG! Obviously not all of their menu is authentic Mexican; they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of Mexican with Korean and other styles. To keep it traditional, we order the Tacos de Carne Asada and to try something new had the Tacos de Pollo con Kimchi. The carne asada tacos were legit!!!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, the red salsa was spicy and delicious, and the tortilla was made to perfection. The carne asada tacos definitely made me think about my hometown of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. The Kimchi Chicken tacos, were also really good and fresh, but I gotta say they were a little too oily for my taste, and could barely taste the chicken. It was definitely something I had never tried before and I actually kind of like it.Also, we were here on a Tuesday and they had a deal of 3 tacos for the price of 2 (#WINNING).","378":"Good for Americans who need a taste of home while on vacation. The service was good and the food was better. The menu needs to state all ingredients. We had a vegan with us who requested the vegetable burrito bowl and asked for the crema to be left off. \u00c2\u00a0It does not say there is cheese on it, but it came with cheese. \u00c2\u00a0When we explained the person was vegan, they immediately fixed it. \u00c2\u00a0They were apologetic and fixed it with no issues. \u00c2\u00a0Their nachos are some of the best!","379":"The food was average, the staff were lacklustre and I left thinking the place was run like it did not matter that you've paid a fair bit for a good night out. Worse of all, no one else seemed to care that they were paying high prices for really average food and service. Not a good investment in a night out. Compared to Mexican restaurants in LA or Vegas, this was pale in comparison.","380":"As a California native I can assure you the food is on point. \u00c2\u00a0While visiting Singapore with my family, we visited Vatos on a whim (Mexican food in Southeast Asia?!?). \u00c2\u00a0It was incredible! \u00c2\u00a0The guacamole and OG margarita were excellent. \u00c2\u00a0No bottled mix here, just tons of fresh lime juice. \u00c2\u00a0The Korean fusion elevates traditional Mexican dishes to a whole new level. \u00c2\u00a0You have got to try the Kimchi carnitas fries, they are out of this world! \u00c2\u00a0The Fat Bastard burrito bowl lives up to it's name, it is ginormous (but very tasty). \u00c2\u00a0Loved the addition of a crispy cheese layer to the quesadilla. \u00c2\u00a0A note to another reviewer,freshly made corn tortillas are supposed to be thin. \u00c2\u00a0I'm sorry we were too full for dessert. \u00c2\u00a0The place was busy (and as others have noted loud), but the service was good. \u00c2\u00a0Overall I would highly recommend.","381":"Awesome place, great fusion tacos, loved the Korean Galbi tacos and the Shrimp tacos were incredible. Will definitely be back. I wish there were 6 stars.","382":"First things first: don't be alarmed when your party's food does not arrive at the same time. The plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen. You'll see this throughout Singapore. Vatos Tacos is a delightful Mexican\/Korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles (sorry, couldn't help myself) and rice you'll consume whilst in Singapore. \"Chips\" (more accurately, tortillas) and salsa are complimentary with your visit. What I Got and What I Thought:1. Chimichurri Chicken Urban Taco \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 DELICIOUS. Would absolutely have this again. The chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the \"spicy\" chicken. While it did have a nice kick to it, I finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips. As long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden. If you're interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it, but you're worried about spice, just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for. 2. Honey Tequila Chicken Wings  \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table. As you could surmise from the name of the dish, the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet, but they do come covered in slices of chilies. The heat-fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies (this is a simple task). Vegan and vegetarian options are available!","383":"Good food nice environment great selection almost to much to choose from. Only service was lacking a bit with plenty of staff they could have gotten us to order a few more margaritas had they only asked and never asked us we wanted desert by the time we got the bill we didn't.","384":"Mexican food in Singapore? Yes absolutely Yes! If it's what your craving \u00c2\u00a0this is the place. Chips and salsa. Drinks and the food is good. Loved the salsa.","385":"First night in Singapore and fou d this hidden gem. It needs to be on your must try list!! Chimichuri street tacos with enough heat to numb your lips but filled with so much flavor, you won't stop eating!","386":"Long story short. $30 for a margarita is insane. Go somewhere else for a drink. Only go on Taco Tuesday to get 3 tacos for the price of 2 at $12. Service could be improved greatly. I waited at least 15 mins to place my order. The barbacoa tacos were delicious, but I won't be back.","387":"The place was having Korean-Mexican-Filipino Thanksgiving party with Iskina Cebu. The place was packed but lucky I had made a reservation in advance. We were showed to a high chair table by side. The place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining.Chimichurri Lechon Tacos (S$15++\/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu lechon, chimichurri salsa.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o Pork Belly Lechon Tacos (S$15++\/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu pork belly lechon, pickled onions, jalape\u00c3\u00b1os relish.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. I'm Rick James, Peach! (S$30++)Frozen Peach margarita + Tecate BeerThe margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down. It was not too sweet. Oh man I was red like a peach after having the drink. Didn't get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order.","388":"This place is just mediocre. The food isn't as flavorful as it should be, it's overpriced, and the service is poor.","389":"Reservations highly suggested. We came on a random Tuesday night and this place was packed. Since we came all this way, we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for \"take-away\". Luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between 30 minutes to 2 hours. Judging from the crowd, anticipation filled our hungry souls. The menu isn't extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order. We looked at the menu for a good 10 minutes before we decided on what to order. Dinner- all of us got the Fat Bastard burrito bowl. This was our favorite thing here. My colleagues and I couldn't stop raving about it. The rice, the sour cream, the beans, the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed. The kimchi fries were pretty good; the kimchi had a kick and I loved the jalape\u00c3\u00b1os. The fries seemed to come out of a bag though...The galbi no rice burrito I had the following day for lunch was packed. The galbi was tender and let's just say that it was too good to eat just half of it. I loved how tender yet firm the black beans are. The sauces that it came w\/ only elevated the overall taste. No sauce needed. Craving a burrito bowl now!!!","390":"Traveling alone on business with a free day in Singapore. After visiting the national museum I decided to stop here for lunch. Street tacos are pretty common back in the US, and this looked intriguing. I will admit, the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but I thought I'd give it a shot. While I really wanted this to be good, there were several \u00c2\u00a0negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum. So if you're a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos, you're out of luck. It's only \u00c2\u00a03 of one type or \u00c2\u00a04 of two types, etc \u00c2\u00a0 No big deal if you're dining with friends, but cut me some slack. I'm a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you \u00c2\u00a0wouldn't do it even with a \u00c2\u00a0polite request to make an exception. So I ordered 3 pork barbecoa and they were delicious. \u00c2\u00a0So delicious, I was wishing I could have tried some others. The \"Cowboy Queso\" on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it's as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl. So we're batting 50 50 on food quality.Then there's the service. Kind of disinterested and bothered would he how I would describe it. Ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed. My server never showed again either and I had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go.It's a pretty nice place and the one taco I tried was delicious, but beyond that, there's not much to recommend here and given the negatives, I'm not sure I would come back. So much excellent food in Singapore, so lots of other options.","391":"This place has good tacos and guacamole. I got take out and they were very friendly. I'm a Texan living abroad so I get taco-lonely easy, and these ones set me right for a spell.","392":"So where do I begin? Opened about a month ago, Vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and\/or drinks. The margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer\/cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass. As for the food, for me it's not something new and exciting. Roy Choi started the whole Korean taco theme in Los Angeles circa 2008, and it's been duplicated around the world. I'm still looking for \"the\" place in SG that serves up the Tex-Mex\/Cali-Mex versions that my palate is familiar with. Don't get me wrong, Vatos is a great choice for asian-influenced Mexican street food. The tacos were, how do I put it? ... tasty but unsubstantial. Maybe I'm jaded by being from California, but ~$12++ for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey. The homemade tortillas were good but a little thin. The flavors were a mash-up of Mexican and Korean, which I enjoyed. The Kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty. Don't know if the fries were salted, hopefully not, because the kimchi, cheese, and carnitas were already sodium loaded. Would come back again because there are things on the menu I still want to try. Mucho gusto.","393":"On the first morning during a business trip to Singapore, my boss gave me two options for breakfast -- Continental breakfast at our hotel or some Indian food. Wasn't much of a choice. We walked for about 40 odd minutes from our hotel on Orchard to Little India soaking in the heat, humidity and the greenery. Admiring the clean streets and the well-mannered motorist. Silently pondering that this looks and feels like India except for much cleaner. Sigh! We descended onto MTR courtesy Yelp. MTR is a small, clean, air-conditioned restaurant. Trust me 40 mins of a morning walk in 90% humidity you respect air conditioning. I ordered the pudi dosa, neer dosa, and the filter coffee. I confess I wouldn't have tried those (except filter coffee) if it were not for the nudge of my colleague. I had never tried those two. The pudi dosa came first with the chutney and the sambhar. Oh, man! Those flavors and the texture. It looked like an uttapam (the savory pancake) with ghee and a concoction of red spice on top. Not hot but spicy. Amazing flavors. It had been a while that Indian food has surprised my palate. Writing this review triggers the flavor and aroma memories, such a delight. Then came the neer dosa. Neer means water in the local language. As the name suggests its very light and subtle flavors. Quite the contrast from the previous dish. This came paired with coconut sauteed gently with cardamon and sugar. It was heavenly for me, my colleague, on the other hand, was slightly less impressed. He said he has had better neer dosa. I believe him it was amazing for me. Two chutneys and the sambhar came with one of the dosas, not sure what came with what. What I can tell you with confidence it that my colleague and I agreed that the coconut chutney was as authentic as it gets and as flavorful as one expects. We topped off the food with filter coffee. That was probably the least favorite for me. It tasted like instant coffee. Not a huge fan. I went back another day for more pudi dosa. My new favorite south Indian restaurant only 17-hour flight away from Palo Alto and 5 hours from India :)PS: I wish I had clicked pictures.","394":"This was a delight to go to in little India. Very good service and authentic unique menu which is not so common in South Indian restaurants. I have been using MTR spices and have known this brand since childhood. So going to the restaurant was exciting and special. The manager graciously let us keep our stroller outside the door and mentioned not to worry about it. The server was very helpful and told us to try few specials which we relished. I definitely enjoyed their set dosa. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for South Indian meal or just tidbits.","395":"Love that I stumbled across this gem on my first day in Singapore! Delicious food, kind service, reasonable prices, credit cards accepted. I've been working my way through the menu and everything I've gotten so far has been fantastic. Always crowded, it's that good.","396":"Great food at good prices. I ordered the Mini meal, pudi idli and buttermilk.Pudi idli ($5) was my favoriteBisibelabath, raita, rava kesari and avial (in mini meal, $6) were outstanding.Veg pulav was good and curd rice was decent. But again I've never been a fan of curd rice so my opinion could be biased. Buttermilk ($3) was very good too.The portion size is generous. One dish should suffice.","397":"Firstly, the place is clean, and I mean CLEAN, even by Singapore standards, in keeping with the high standards set by the original location in Bangalore. Try to go before 11:30am for lunch, especially on weekends, and before 7pm in the evenings. To order, one must get in line at the cashier and pay up front. Then one gets a stand with the order number which is displayed on ones table. Menu highlights include the ragi (finger millet) dosa, bisi bele bhaath (rice cooked with lentils and veggies), puliyogare (tamarind rice), maddur vada (crispy fritters seasoned with onion, curry leaves and spices), set dosa (like pancakes) served with coconut veggie curry called avial. \u00c2\u00a0Drinks are decent: the lassi is always good to try, as is the badam (almond) milk. This visit I had the akki roti (roti made from rice flour and seasoned with onion and green chili) and button idly soaked in thove (kind of a thin daal, without the typical spices of sambhar or rasam).For dessert, I highly recommend the badam halwa, which is a deceptively small serving. However, since it consists of just ground almonds, ghee and sugar, it packs a massive punch. DO NOT underestimate its ability to fill you up. Only reason I give it 4 stars is that the spice level is often a tad too high for me. Else thumbs up, including for the prompt and courteous service.","398":"Love the food. Not a veggie guy but this place has one of the best dosas in town. Enjoyed the unique experience","399":"Overhyped Indian snacks restaurant.Prata Walau serves better dosai at better price too!Good for tourists though.","400":"Not only is the indian food absolutely incredible but they were extremely considerate about my dairy allergy here. The food came out quickly and the owner double checked to make sure it had no allergens. Great food, great vegan\/dairy allergy options, and nice service! Plus lots of free drinking water. All around great experience","401":"Uddin vada- similar to a donut. Very good... Fried crispy but inside was softPudi masala dosa- has a spongy texture. Came with potatoes on topMini meal set- tastings of five different rice \"stew\" sampler","402":"This place was up off the beaten path past Little India and my husband and I went way out of our way to go here based on the reviews. We ordered dosai (dosa) dishes and the sooji (halwa) for dessert. The dosai were way too crispy, missing the al dente chew you look for in a good dosa, especially if you intend to roll it up; it requires a flexibility to do so. Service was meh and the wait was long for a table. Lots of local Indians so clearly they are doing something right though.","403":"Some amazing South Indian food here! Its a very distinct style though, something I've not tasted so far! The dosa is thicker than usual but oh so crispy!! Loved the vegetable special dosa.. unique texture and great taste. The rice idli and coffee was amazing too.. will be back for sure!!","404":"Poor quality. Oily food. I guess this is the state of all Indian restaurants in Singapore.","405":"Love, love, love MTR in Singapore! Don't miss the bisibele bath, set dosa and filter coffee. Liked it so much that we had MTR catering and all our guests loved it. Fully vegetarian menu. Service is fast and restaurant is centrally located in Little India.","406":"I wasn't wanting for vegetarian but was very happy I sought out MTR is Little India. \u00c2\u00a0Authentic curries and breads stuffed with all good things, such as potato and onion. \u00c2\u00a0Popular with the locals too, so you know you are into a good thing. \u00c2\u00a0Do try it! \u00c2\u00a0If it's veggie curry in a hurry you're after, you won't be disappointed.","407":"The best South Indian food in Singapore for the price range. That's saying a lot since there is a lot of completion for the same kind of food there. Used to go there often, love the dosas, button idlis, vada, filter coffee. Consistent good food, used to eat there then pack food for home. Highly recommend it.","408":"this was the most authentic indian food ive tasted in singapore. the staff were extremely friendly and even seated me at 3 pm right as they were closing down for a switch to dinner. i was really blessed by my experience!! highly recommended!! a must try in singapore!! many thanks!!!*pictured below is a famous single uddina vada doughnut accompanied with chutney","409":"Amazing restaurant. Very homely food for me as a South Indian. The food is well cooked and tastes very different and unique compared to other Indian restaurants around Little India. Try the Pudi Dosa (A dosa with spicy chutney powder and ghee) which is very special to this place. Service is fast and friendly. I will come back again and again and again.","410":"Nothing more you can ask for a early morning Dosa. \u00c2\u00a0Crispy and spiced just nice. \u00c2\u00a0Came here at exactly 8:30am Saturday and was the first customer. \u00c2\u00a0No issue finding parking which is mostly a drag for eateries around here. \u00c2\u00a0Place is clean service is excellent. \u00c2\u00a0Before 9 it was packed. \u00c2\u00a0Back again July 3rd with the in laws and yep this as good and efficient as ever.","411":"Nothing more you can ask for a early morning Dosa. \u00c2\u00a0Crispy and spiced just nice. \u00c2\u00a0Came here at exactly 8:30am Saturday and was the first customer. \u00c2\u00a0No issue finding parking which is mostly a drag for eateries around here. \u00c2\u00a0Place is clean service is excellent. \u00c2\u00a0Before 9 it was packed.","412":"We went to MTR for breakfast two days in a row as we loved it! Food was freshly prepared and tasty. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. The staff was attentive. It does get pretty crowded on weekends. As soon as you enter the restaurant you need to place the order at the counter before being seated. Hence it's better to take a look at the menu, which is placed outside the restaurant before entering so that you don't feel rushed. I would highly recommend this place for good old Indian breakfast.","413":"Deliciousness exemplified! The taste of set dosa took me back to the days of delicious dosas at udupi upahar in kormangala.... south Indian cuisine is hands down the best of all!!","414":"Celebrated my nieces birthday dinner here. First time to Cut and it was awesome!!! Kobe beef steak was incredible as was the service. Thank you!!","415":"One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.Starters are amazing - we ordered the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a whileIf you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationService was really slow and not attentive \/ definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating.","416":"I've been craving for steak this past week and finally decided to stop by this location. The filet mignon was tender, flavorful and delicious. I was too hungry so I devoured it before taking any pictures \u00c2\u00a0The bone marrow was mouth watering. All staff members were attentive without being too excessive. Glynn, the manager at CUT, definitely made my short visit to Singapore a 10\/10 experience. She volunteered to call the souvenir shop within Marina Bay Hotel twice to verify its location and look up some information for me. Glynn also recommended a popular drink of the restaurant, \"Rough Love.\" Unique and easy to drink. You should try it! I attached the picture below. Thank you everyone at the CUT for an amazing meal and experience!","417":"Superb service. You can't expect anything less from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. And it's at the Marina Bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here.Plenty of steaks to choose from. They also make some good cocktails.Again service was great. They kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met. Reservations are recommended although I'm sure they can squeeze you in.","418":"Just wanted to say thanks to Mary and the people at CUT who made for a very special evening. Had the Porterhouse for 2 perfectly cooked to medium rare. Service was excellent. Was given a nice little surprise at the end of the meal to celebrate an engagement. I'm glad I chose this place. It was worth it.","419":"One of the best steaks I have ever tasted.We went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people, portion wise. It comes with two sauces and 4 different mustards. The steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it. Ordered kale and the patata as sides. The patata was really good as well.Finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert. They were ok but nothing special, wouldn't mind skipping them next time.","420":"I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w\/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company.","421":"Mr. Puck is - next to Arnie - one of the more famous and successful Austrian \"exports\". He now ranks amongst the best chefs\/restaurateurs in the world, and \"Spago\" in LA is an institution that has found worldwide fame, now present in many locations, Singapore included. Another venture of his is CUT, focusing on steak. We booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously.As there are many other reviews raving about this place I'm trying to keep it short, hoping to contribute to a coherent picture.Service is very friendly, efficient, and, which I always find refreshing at \"celebrity restaurants\", authentic. No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern\/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab\/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from \"the usual\". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))","422":"Event Planners - Beware! I am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience. I gave 2 stars because the food and service was good, the management team organizing was not. I felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because I was not onsite to confirm. I was also charged a higher amount on wine as they didn't have the type I chose of which I am still awaiting a refund, from early March. The communication has been slow and not genuine. My concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager.","423":"Came here on a pretty amazing, random whim with a great gentleman & his crew while visiting Singapore. My goodness... The presentation & flavor of the drinks & food were AMAZING. And orgasmic. How they made carrots, Mac & cheese, mini Kobe burgers, fish tacos, & potatoes (all separate dishes) taste like culinary heaven is beyond me. The bartender and servers were courteous & lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.","424":"This has got to be the best steak house I have ever experienced. I am formerly of New York City and had my fair share of solid steaks. I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative \"mixology\" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their \"spiked\" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)","425":"I took my husband here for his birthday while in Singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we've been to. The server was A+ & so was dinner. My favorite was my mocktail (apple, cucumber, & basil).What a great experience? Needless to say, he enjoyed his birthday.","426":"Best steaks in town!The Kobe steak is just amazing! I had the filet mignon. The pork belly starter was also really good.","427":"I took myself on Valentine's Day after working a long day. For starters, the bread was delish. I preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter. I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the souffl\u00c3\u00a9 arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl\u00c3\u00a9. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!","428":"This is probably the best steak house in Singapore ! We ordered the wagu grade 8 steak. It literally melt in our mouths ! We started with the tuna tartar. ExcellentThen we had the steak that was shared. \u00c2\u00a0Heaven Wine was ok , on the expensive side. \u00c2\u00a0They won't allowed us to bring our own ! \u00c2\u00a0A bit of a downer We finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9. A highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least $200+ per person.","429":"Dined here a few weeks ago. \u00c2\u00a0Crab cakes, butter lettuce, filet with the apple crumble dessert. \u00c2\u00a0Enjoyed it very much. Filet was excellently prepared. Would definitely return here next time.","430":"I really don't have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the LA version, which usually annoys me. \u00c2\u00a0From what I recall, they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends. We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York. \u00c2\u00a0D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point. \u00c2\u00a0On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair. Overall, a place to go in Singapore when you're missing some good quality meat in your life!","431":"The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes.","432":"CUT is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world, offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from Japan.The menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what I would expect in a West Coast or Las Vegas steakhouse (no surprise)--contemporary, minimalist furnishing and decor. \u00c2\u00a0Small plates with a modern cuisine flair, like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce. \u00c2\u00a0The US Angus filet I had was absolutely spot on and delicious.The wine list had a pretty good range in the by-the-glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails--classic and innovative both.Stylistically I prefer the 'old school' New York\/Chicago style steakhouses (this I would not categorize as \"Traditional American Restaurants\")--where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal. \u00c2\u00a0So while I enjoyed my experience, the match goes to other team--particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it's up against.","433":"Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking...But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost.","434":"Waku Ghin is a phenomenal meal. The Uni is obviously the stand out dish, but on reflection, every course is exquisite in its own fashion. The seared Amadai had a smokey crispness, the Wagyu was divine and deserts superb. It ended up $600pp (incl 2 glasses of wine each.) This is a crazy expensive meal - and there are more affordable tasting menus elsewhere. However, if you love seafood, you can't miss this meal.","435":"I was able to fortuitously find a seat in this temple of Japanese inspired cuisine in Singapore, but you should book weeks in advance if you want a seat. They only serve 20 customers at a time, in small 6 people dining rooms in front of a grill and your own chef.Dinner is omakase only with a price tag of 400SGD plus tax, and of course you may wish to pair it with wines (a wine pairing where every dish comes with a recommended wine or sake costs additional 250SGD).Service is elegant but also extremely personal. Since I was dining alone, my server made a point to strike conversation a couple of times, gently and always respectfully. I really appreciated the tone and the courtesy of all the servers.The dinner starts with impressive raw seafood dishes, among which I certainly was amazed by their signature dish, a composition of sea urchin (uni), shrimp and caviar. One of the most delicious dishes I ever had, and I traveled extensively in Japan tasting some of the best kaiseki ryori in the country. Other gems followed: tagliolini with caviar and freshly grated truffle. Abalone gently grilled and then smoked in front of us with cherry blossoms (!). A bouillabaisse of lobster. Delight after delight, concluded by a delicious and delicate ochazuke.Each dish was expertly described, along with suggestions to enjoy its flavor at the best.After dinner, each party is moved to their own table, together with people from the other rooms, in another common dining space overlooking the marina and the famous Singapore skyline, not to mention the light and fountain show. Here delicious desserts are served (pre dessert, main and petit four, in a very customary sequence).In summary, this was a masterpiece dining experience, flawless from start to finish in all its most minute details. The price tag is serious, but I am not regretting a single dollar at the end of this sumptuous dinner.","436":"TLDR: bar service was great. This review is for the bar service and not the 10 course meal. My wife and I came in the evening on a weekday and were promptly greeted and seated. Our server was knowledgeable about all the dishes and amply explained things. I ended up getting their pear fruit cocktail and a melon cocktail (underneath their Japanese fruit cocktail section) which were both delectable. We split the lobster spaghetti, Wagyu chim over rice and the fried chicken. The Wagyu was so wonderfully fatty you could feel you're gallbladder contract after eating it. I was only here on vacation but next time I might plan ahead for the 10 course meal which looks incredible. Per my server it's usually a one or two weeks advance reservation but call in case there's openings the night of.","437":"Omg one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. First to start... just walking into this place feels VIP... and the cocktails are phenomenal.The muscat cocktail was my favorite to start with, and the Japanese peach.We were seated in the bar area first and when our private room was ready, we went in. It's pretty amazing that everyone gets a chefs table seat and you get to watch majority of the food prepared in front of you.It's an omakase that consists of fresh seafood and some meat. Dietary requests can be accommodated as well. But I myself don't have any so I just go with whatever the suggest.Chef Tetsuya is mega famous and he is literally the god father of soooooo many world renowned talented chefs. I honestly don't even know if he knows how many of his offspring are very successful chefs with multiple restaurants under their belts in highly populated cities. I've been to many Tetsuya offspring restaurants, so although it was my first time eating at his restaurant and even though it was prepared by one of his chefs and not him, the dishes were embraced by my palette.I left this restaurant soooo happy. Even though we came to celebrate my hubby's bday... I felt like it was mine. Every dish was beyond amazing.I am a big fan of the abalone, the prawn and the Wagyu cooked to perfection as well as their signature dish... the sea urchin, baby Shrimp & Caviar. Just stunning. The seafood bouboulaise with bread was also excellent. I hope to come back sometime in this lifetime!","438":"KenScale: 9.5\/10The best meal I had during my stay in Singapore also happened to be the most expensive one. I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (\"Ghin\" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!","439":"Never thought I would say this, but I found a downside to spontaneity. And that is: can't get reservations anywhere!So I figured I'll just eat at the bar. It's a la carte at the bar. There's both counter and tables at the bar. Ordered the steak. It was okay. The sauce was too sweet, which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak. Normally I love sweet sauce on anything, so I don't know what they did wrong with this sauce. Just didn't go.Perhaps, the food is better not at the bar, but after this steak, I'm not dying to come back.","440":"I guess our expectations were different and we didn't have the required refined tastes to enjoy the meal. We were a party of 6, had the omakase ofc, some v expensive sake, and 6xS$20 of still water?!?Overall i was dissapointed. Maybe I did not enjoy the subtleness of the 10 well-presented courses enough but honestly I was expecting to be wowed but in the end I came away with 3000 reasons why I could have eaten elsewhere for 5* food but much much better value.The uni was decent and the a5 wagyu was ok but everything else was sub-par and honestly not worth the $400++ \u00ef\u00bc\u0088don't forget gst + service) we paid per person. However our chef from Japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally-supposed ta be-haute-gastronomic experience.Like the new hublot ferrari engine watch. Or not.O well. At least they had phone charger for my poor Android phone..*also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi :(( but o well i guess u can't choose in omakase.","441":"Amazing food, great service and superb wine pairing. My favorite was the cold noodle at the end of the meal. It was surprising refreshing.","442":"There is a reason why this place is ranked as one of the Top 50 restaurants in the world. A culinary experience not to be missed!","443":"My life is complete...I ate off of the bar menu at Waku Ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range. Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni\/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu.","444":"dear wakuda san,i hope this letter finds you well.my father won big by taking germany to win the world cup and so was able to dine in your restaurant last night.coincidentally, it was his birthday but alas he dined WITHOUT ME, as he said you were too expensive for kids to tag along:(the first thing he said, when i saw him this morning was,\"son, you need to study really hard and make sure that you can speak clearly and communicate properly!\"i was perplexed.but apparently, the uncles and aunties who served him last night weren't able to do so without him constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said, again and again.despite that, service was still good but communications was a big F.i guess your exquisite culinary creations have to speak for themselves?!the awkward teppanyaki counter setup further detracted from the dining experience as it proved more of an obstacle to service rather than a chance to showcase your gourmet menu.frankly speaking, there were no knives flying nor fancy schmancy cooking skills that warrants the teppanyaki counter's existence.anything he had, from the teppan, could easily have been cooked in the kitchen.the only good thing about it was he got to snap more shots for posting on Yelp!he also mentioned another uncle customer commented on how you no longer cook your abalone dish at the counter anymore.so it's just the canadian lobster, tasmanian cape grim beef and japanese ohmi wagyu beef that benefited from the under utilized, obtrusive teppan.you are probably better off without it!BUT obviously, he LOVED your food!5 stars for that alone!he flew to sydney just to dine at your flagship restaurant and has been ever so effusive about your delicate cooking that incorporates the best produce and is always full of flavours!just check out his gazillion photos(when he gets round to uploading them all) and you can't help but click on 'LIKE'!he said that it looks as good as it tastes or is it the other way around?!anyway, just when he thought dinner was over, you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts!the pre-dessert kyoho grapes and granita was simple but amazing, so sweet yet with a tinge of sour and the icy granita kept those seedless halves just firm enough before melting away in your mouth!the dessert proper was a mango passion fruit cremet d'anjou, not properly explained and he had to refer to the menu they printed out for him, it was quality but nothing mind blowing.then he was surprised with what looks like your signature chocolate cake with perfectly scribbled chocolate birthday wishes! thank you for saving me the trouble of having to buy him a birthday cake!i mean the cake i buy, can never come close to the velvety finish that he mentioned in passing.finally, your petit cinq completed a lovely evening of gastronomy.even though he was so full, he still popped every single one into his mouth instead of bringing some home for me!:(uncle, you kept him away for a good 3 hours but that was a good thing as it allowed the bottle of tsuki no katsura iwaimai, nigori, junmai daiginjo to vanish and for him to depart on a sake high.thank you for making it an overall memorable evening for him.yours sincerely,nik juniorp.s. hopefully, he does not have to wait till the next world cup to be back again!;)","445":"Waku Ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy. It will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it's just so much food. Also, be sure to set aside 3.5 to 4 hours to dine here, it's long. Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable. I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the \"menu\", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal. You say OK and move on with your culinary journey.Both of my experiences, I had essentially the same dishes (I believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season). I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience.","446":"Waku Ghin. Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening.","447":"Located in the glitzy expanse of Marina Bay Sands, Waku Ghin definitely offers culinary decadence. The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time. I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place. The staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests.","448":"... We love Japanese Food ...

Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience. \u00c2\u00a0In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world. \u00c2\u00a0Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff. \u00c2\u00a0To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side. \u00c2\u00a0Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space. \u00c2\u00a0Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening. \u00c2\u00a0Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms. \u00c2\u00a0This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu. \u00c2\u00a0We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us. \u00c2\u00a0I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list. \u00c2\u00a0If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat. \u00c2\u00a0I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive! \u00c2\u00a0At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along. \u00c2\u00a0I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food. \u00c2\u00a0Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth! \u00c2\u00a0Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction. \u00c2\u00a0 Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert. \u00c2\u00a0The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening. \u00c2\u00a0We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening. \u00c2\u00a0A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience. \u00c2\u00a0From the food, to the decor, to the service. \u00c2\u00a0This is seamless top class dining. \u00c2\u00a0This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come.","450":"Amazing food. \u00c2\u00a0Watching the preparation was great too. \u00c2\u00a0Overall a fantastic experience!","451":"A place for high-rollersAt $400 per head before taxes, Waku Ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner. (And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ \/10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite. \u00c2\u00a0For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well.","452":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Singapore. the ambiance and the food, defines what good dining experience should be. It is expensive and reservations are hard to come by, but its worth it.","453":"Absolutely insane cocktails! Kind of expensive th1. Stunning views, but great ambiance2. Music is popping later, best at sundowners3. Menu is not super loaded 4. Great for short lunch rendezvous","454":"We went here for drinks and they have super sweet cocktails. We ordered 5 and couldn't finish half of any of them. On the other hand, the drinks are huge!Other then that, we had a great view of the gardens from our table.","455":"One of the best views of the city without a doubt!Was here for a company happy hour event. They have a minimum spend for large groups but the host was gracious enough to accomodate us even otherwise. Drinks are nice and strong, and they have some excellent canap\u00c3\u00a9s as well. Service is great as well. Its right next to the infamous infinity pool though that is for guests only. It's expensive though given the location and the view, the cost is worth it!","456":"Wonderful lunch spot with the incredible 57th floor views of Singapore and the Bay. Our reservation timed perfectly with a thunderstorm so we got to watch the clouds roll in. We enjoyed the Grilled Organic Chicken Club - Brioche, Apple Wood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Sunny-Side Up Egg, Comt\u00c3\u00a9 Cheese, Herb Aioli. Super soft bread and tons of veggies. And the Bincho Grilled Salmon Salad - Hijiki Seaweed Rice, Korean Banchan, Gochujang, Sesame, ChiliThe salmon fell apart as soon as my fork touched it- perfectly buttery and light. The array of types of salads beneath the salmon was really neat to experiment with. I paired with the Wolfgang Puck Chardonnay and could not have been happier.","457":"To be honest we came here to eat just because of the view and being Californians it seemed very appropriate. \u00c2\u00a0Naturally this restaurant will be everything you expected to be, incredible service, incredible food, and a view that rivals every other view.","458":"View is amazing. This bar is next to the infamous infinity pool, so if you can't afford a night in the hotel and still was to see the pool, this is going to be your best option. I absolutely loved the view. Menu prices are decent for being what it is and where it is. For Singapore, the prices are pretty average. I recommend coming to this spot highly if you're unable to stay a night at this hotel!","459":"The view is great from up here. This is a better alternative to queuing up for the sky park.","460":"Had an amazing lunch at Spago. Beautiful views of the Gardens by the Bay from the top of Marina Bay Sands. Excellent food and service. A remarkable price (45 SGD per person for three courses). The portions are also very generous. It's amazing to go to such a high-end restaurant and not leave hungry. Unequivocally recommend this place. Appetizers: P\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9 de Campagne, delicious and a large portionBig Eye Tuna Tartare Cones, two, small, delicious one-bite conesMains: Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad, perfect execution on this classicSteamed Japanese Sea Bream, large portion, good flavor, beautiful presentationDessert: Pistachio Panna Cotta, one of the best desserts I've had all year","461":"Second night in a row here. The drinks are fantastic. The view of the skyline is beautiful and the halo halo dessert is heavenly. I had halo halo several times in the Philippines but I actually preferred this version over what I've had in the home that originated the unique cultural dessert. Definitely suggest trying it.","462":"Being at the top of the \"boat\" at the top of the Sands in the hottest spot in Singapore is enough reason to go. \u00c2\u00a0The bartender is amazing, the scene would make anyone envious, and watching people swim in the infinity pool at the top of the world is about as perfect a view as there is. \u00c2\u00a0But then the food... A very expensive burger as you would expect - with the ideal brioche bun and seasonings reflective of the region, and fries crispy on the outside soft in the middle. \u00c2\u00a0The only thing keeping it from five stars was that I was emphatic about a medium rare burger (they acted as though I was crazy for ordering it) and then served it well done. Bot a glimmer of pink. \u00c2\u00a0Oh well, totally worth it anyway. \u00c2\u00a0:)","463":"Fantastic meal high up on top of Marina Bay Sands. \u00c2\u00a0Sat by the window which was nice for seeing the tree light show below. \u00c2\u00a0FYI shows are at 7:45 and 8:45 pm. \u00c2\u00a0Had both an appetizer (white asparagus) and main dish (lamb). \u00c2\u00a0There is a good wine list to complement the food. \u00c2\u00a0A selection of breads with both salted and unsalted butter was delicious!We did not order desert but they provided a very nice anniversary plate to celebrate our special occasion.","464":"A BIG thank you to the staff @spagosingapore! We wanted to end our last night in Singapore with a special dinner so Spago was a great choice! .Spago is located on the top floor of Marina Bay Sands and the view is BREATHTAKING ! The staff made us feel so special! The love and hospitality was amazing. We will be back soon! .Thank you to the managers who came out to talk to us and even brought our main course out! ..Starter: 10\/10 - Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones.Complimentary From the chef: 10\/10 Pumpkin Brown Butter Dumplings ..Main: 10\/10 Honey Miso Broiled Black Cod & 8\/10 Dutch Milk Fed Veal Chop ..Desert: 10\/10 Calamansi Vanilla Vacherin ..","465":"Amazing! \u00c2\u00a0 Food was superb - every small plate was \u00c2\u00a0absolutely delicious and perfect. The staff were very attentive without being in your way. Tables are spaced a reasonable distance apart. Cocktails were tasty! But the views. From the 57th floor, open air with infinity pool in front of you, 360degree views that are dazzling. The Garden by the Bay, the city skyline, the cargo ships lined up like an old painting in a museum. Words don't do it justice. It was expensive, but oh so worth it!!","466":"Best place to chill in evenings and try some food and cocktails together ! There are hidden cocktails which you can order only if you have been there ! I wouldn't revel the secret as it's really amazing to order those exclusive cocktails ( not in the menu ). The staff is very friendly and best time to go is between 4-8pm when there is easy availability of seats to relax and enjoy the evening. Price is on higher side for every dish compared to normalPlaces due to its location and view of the entire city !","467":"You think Spago is beyond over and it's this dusty relic from the past, but I was so happy with my experience. Unbeatable location with views of the crazy MBS pool and the surrounding city. Lovely ambiance and very spacious inside too. Excellent service - attentive and friendly. Drinks in Singapore are so pricey (especially at and around MBS), and given those circumstances, they have one of the best happy hours. The drinks are delicious and so is the food. I could come here everyday for a drink, some spring rolls, and chicken karaage and be happy. Seriously though, I'm a seasoned international drinker, and the cocktails here and the other Wolfgang Puck restaurant, Cut, are some of the best I've ever had.","468":"Perched atop the famous Marina Bay Sands is Spago, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant\u00c2\u00a0that has locations around the world. My personal favorite is the Beverly Hills location but the Singapore location has the best views by far.I went for lunch and made a 12pm reservation in hopes of dodging the suits that were sure to fill the dining area later in the afternoon. Getting to the top of MBS is always an adventure and I got lost as I took the wrong elevator in Tower 2 (which only took me to the 22nd floor) but eventually made it to the top after three elevator transfers. The proposed route involves two elevator transfers so keep an eye out for the lifts that take you up to the 55th floor in Tower 2 and then take a second lift up to the 57th floor. Upon arriving you'll see the Spago Bar and Lounge to your right and the fine dining area to your left. Straight ahead you'll see glimpses of the mouth-dropping view through the welcome area.The fine dining area has a dress code of business casual and I saw many people turned away for wearing flip flops or swim gear (the restaurant shares a roof with an infinity pool) so I put on a decent dress with slip on sneakers. It seemed to work just fine and I was seated promptly by the window which overlooks the water where you can watch the ships hang out just past the Gardens by the Bay.The staff were so nice and didn't seem to mind me, a lone blogger, taking a table all to myself. The interior of the dining room is gorgeous with white table cloths and a beautiful orchid center piece. It honestly seemed a lot classier than the Beverly Hills Spago and WAY classier than the Las Vegas Spago (which I think shut down -- good riddance.) I was presented with a very luxe a la carte menu for lunch but opted to go with the Express Prix Fixe: 3 Courses for $45.The Express Lunch is quite the deal as I recently paid $36 just for one Singapore Sling. I also got my favorite cocktail, Peace on Earth, for an extra $25. I originally ordered the tuna cones but they already had one made for me so I swapped out my first course for the Chicken 'Laksa' Spring Roll per the recommendation of the staff. This appetizer is unique to the Singapore Spago and I'm really glad I made the swap.I wasn't sure I wanted anything fried but the spring rolls were cooked to perfection and filled with a warm Asian flavors with a thicker curry texture. There is a delicious coconut flavor\u00c2\u00a0that lingered with each bite. I didn't see coconut listed as part of the dish so perhaps I imagined it. Whatever it was, it was great. I enjoyed the tuna cone but it paled in comparison to the Spring Rolls.Next, I got the Steamed Red Snapper. It looked absolutely stunning. The fish was cooked well and the garnish tasted of a light soy sauce and was\u00c2\u00a0enjoyable on its own. It's served with a side of rice which was tasty. I tested the sauce that was on the side but I wasn't a fan so I skipped it. I will say that the flavors of the dish, while delicious, were clearly on or around the fish. If you're looking for a fish with deep flavors infused into every bite, you wont get it with this Snapper. However, if you're like me and you appreciate the natural taste of fish, it's pretty good.Finally, it was time for dessert. Each Express Lunch comes with a Pistachio Panna Cotta. On a hot day, this dessert is truly refreshing with orange flavors all over the panna cotta. There's a lot going on on top of the actual dessert (candied this and that) but the orange gelato was fantastic and the panna cotta itself (ignoring the Pistachio Brittle and other toppings) was divine.\u00c2\u00a0The quality of food, decor, and service at Spago never disappoints\u00c2\u00a0(except in Vegas) and I would highly recommend going to Spago for a business lunch or a special occasion. If you only plan to go to Singapore once, definitely go to Spago for either dinner or just head to the lounge. If you come to Singapore often, it's not a must unless you are in the mood for stunning views paired with delicious views. I'll probably be back at some point.TOTAL COST: $83.5757th Floor of Marina Bay Sands, Tower 2SingaporeThis is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews.","469":"Happy hour 4-7 10$ beers (3 to choose) 16$ drinks (6 to choose)14-16$ wines (4 to choose l) Appetizers. Grilled cheese (yum!)Fried chicken bites (yum) Spring roll (yum) Salmon (no idea) Glynn the manager is welcoming and is interested in those spending time, effort and money to be here. It is truly refreshing to see a manager, staff, restaurant get that the simplest welcoming and earnest hello from staff brings out wallets and creates instant customer retention. The whole staff and experience is welcoming. \u00c2\u00a0This is a busy, Very high end restaurant. It is not cheap. \u00c2\u00a0Those coming here expect to be delivered the best service and expect to pay for the service and ambiance too. \u00c2\u00a0 This place does not disappoint Makes me really happy And it is my number one recommendation in Singapore. (Level 33 is my second)","470":"I have taken quite a few visiting friends to CE LA VI however, I never really liked it: service is very average and f&b offerings are generally disappointing . But obviously you are there for the amazing view. Why no-one ever told me before that there is a much better alternative is a puzzle to me!!Spago Bar & Lounge is simply AWESOME:- the view is in my opinion even better than CLV, you can see the whole of Marina Bay plus you get to see the well known MBS infinity pool.- the service is on point, from the person picking up the phone over the hostess to the waiters, all were really helpful and pro-active.- the food is amazing, who would have thought that a tourist trap such as the MBS rooftop serves on of the BEST burgers in Singapore? And the Tuna Tartare cones are to die for!- the drinks are really great, I am known to be quite picky on my cocktails. Both the Hot Legs and Grin n Bare It were fantastic.The only downside is that they do not serve Ranch Dressing to go with their otherwise delicious burger and fries. I honestly cannot wait to try the other snacks of the bar menu and their full restaurant menu.So I can tell you, you won't see me again at CE LA VI anytime soon - unless Calvin Harris (preferably doused in Ranch) comes and invites me personally.","471":"The view is beautiful as hell the food and drinks are extraordinary!!! The price is not too expensive for the test, beauty and enjoyment you get!!!","472":"The top of this Sands is an unbelievable setting and an amazing view - there is no question about that. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant is lovely and has gone out of its way to make sure that most (all?) tables have amazing views. \u00c2\u00a0That is reason enough to come have a meal here. \u00c2\u00a0I recommend coming during the day, as the view of downtown Singapore is great during the day and there is some amusing people watching at the rooftop pool right next to the restaurant.That being said, the restaurant is quite good and manages to avoid the typical pitfall of the scenic view restaurant - nice house, too bad no one's home. \u00c2\u00a0The food was excellent and definitely approachable for the tourist crowd without being boring. \u00c2\u00a0No small accomplishment. Dumplings, KBLT, and Soft Omelet were all delicious. KBLT was really really good. \u00c2\u00a0Only two issues with the place. \u00c2\u00a0The Tuna Tartare cones were off and we sent them back. \u00c2\u00a0They did come right off the bill, so all good there. \u00c2\u00a0The second is the (typical for Singapore) disinterested level of service. \u00c2\u00a0We had several long, awkward service gaps which required us to flag down our (often absent) waiter. \u00c2\u00a0 We had to ask for more water, etc. \u00c2\u00a0It was a non-stop cavalcade of flagging down wait staff to handle things which should have been handled. \u00c2\u00a0While annoying, this is what I have come to expect in Singapore so I only get mildly annoyed now that my expectations have been beaten into shape.","473":"YESSS.The good news: I can finally cross Santouka off my \"Man I wanna try that one day\" list.The bad: It's now on a cravings list. And $14++ isn't exactly what you want to spend on lunch everyday. The deal: Lunch sets are excellent. Spicy fans - go for the Kara-miso broth. Its depth of flavor really sets this place apart from other places.The sitch: I suspect I reaaalllyyy enjoyed this lunch because the place was empty (super late lunch) and the servers were still so super friendly and attentive throughout. I imagine the eating experience would be very different at peak hours when you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you. TL;DR - Eat lunch here at a non-peak time for ramen you won't regret.","474":"A bit difficult to find. 2nd floor, far corner looking at the hotel and river. Mapquest has a different name, not helpful. Ramen Santouka is what you have to plug in AND you have to know 2nd floor. Had better ramen in Tokyo, dah, but good and inexpensive for table service in Singapore. 3 beers, Gyoza, salad and soft boiled egg ramen was only $61 Singapore dollars. (44.50 US) The salad was super fresh, beers were great (2 Tiger and 1 Asahi) ramen good, pork was a bit too fatty for me. Good and friendly service!","475":"Great location and great food! \u00c2\u00a0For someone who isn't well versed in Raman or even like soup, there are other options to choose from here that can satisfy the ol' appetite. \u00c2\u00a0 My co-worker and I shared the yaki gyoza which were excellent! \u00c2\u00a0I also had their fried chicken which I'd go back just to have that again, and I had a salad which was a good side but honestly, can't remember much about it anymore. \u00c2\u00a0My co-worker had one of the ramen bowls which he thought was pretty good, but I don't think it's the best he's ever had.Location is great as it is right on the quay. \u00c2\u00a0The restaurant is fairly small so it's more intimate and I didn't feel like my food was mass produced. \u00c2\u00a0Service was kind of interesting as I wasn't sure if they choose not to attend tables unless required, but they were polite and helpful when we did flag someone down. \u00c2\u00a0You pay at the desk, not at the table which no one explained to us so we sat for quite some time at the table! \u00c2\u00a0I'd totally come here again!","476":"This place is amazing!!! The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Each person that came to our table was so nice. The food was beyond delicious! I had the original ramen with pork and gyoza. Each little gyoza was perfect and tasted like it was made with Jesus tears! I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a happy belly & a fantastic experience!","477":"One of the best ramen... really authentic Japanese ramen. Love the spicy version with cheeks. The cheeks are really tender and melt in your mouth.The only reason on why I don't give 5 stars is due to the side dishes, I thought they are only average. Try both chicken karagee and fried pork dumpling... both are average.Keep with the ramen, it's the good one.","478":"Everything we had was super good and we wished we could eat more even after being full! The pork cheeks were unbelievable and everyone should have them at least once in their life. We also had the Miso soup, delicious, the salmon salad, and sushi","479":"Nice place, second floor above the street facing Clark quay, ordered the special ramen which was great flavor, rich with very nice tender pork.And the bun (less recommended). And the fried pork gioza- which were really tasty.","480":"The broth was delicious. It is one of the best I have had in Singapore. I got the spicy miso with the pan fried dumpling set and savored every bite. I have to agree that the chasiu was not as tender as I would have liked, but that broth! The dumplings were some of the most flavorful I have had. The staff were very friendly as well and helpful when narrowing down choices. I can't wait to go back!","481":"The ramen was superb: I upgraded from pork belly to pork cheeks--amazingly fall-apart tender and quite lean. And I had the spicy miso base, which wasn't that spicy--just enough to make it interesting. The noodles were thick but still al dente--good mouth feel. The chicken Karage was delicious, and the gyoza were almost perfect. My only complaint? In the course of an hour, we heard an endless loop of Kenny G. Despite how good the ramen is, it doesn't make up for the audible torture I had to endure. My tip: definitely try this, but bring your earphones!","482":"Honestly, I've had much better ramen the the Bay Area but it's the first ramen I've had in Singapore. I was craving ramen so gave this a shot. It took me awhile to find. I left decently full but found the shoyu ramen to be too salty. Also, the salty and fatty pork cheek added to the saltiness. The atmosphere was nice because you can look out onto the river. The only issue was the waiter consistently kept trying to upsell add-ons to the ramen and dishes to multiple tables around. It was annoying the upsell table by table and then the customers would just say no question after question. They should know when to stop asking in my opinion or just not be so aggressive with the upsell. Which is why I decreased my review from a 3 to 2 stars. Not the best ramen and for the price I could try another place rather than returning. I'll have to update this review when I try other ramen in Singapore. Tip: seems like they're a part of certain promotions with credit cards, etc. It may be worth checking out of the deals and if it's available for Santuoka.","483":"Great food, good service, reasonable prices.A little tricky to find in the upstairs location, but once you're there it's very good. It's also not very touristy for being right in clarke quay. I've been a few times for lunch and dinner and it's always very tasty. I always get the standard ramen base and it's always so salty and flavorful. Will continue to go back.","484":"Hands down my fave ramen in Town. \u00c2\u00a0So good it was one of my bucket list of final places to eat during my last week living here. \u00c2\u00a0Seriously the pork cheeks are melt in your mouth amazing and the broth is equally as tasty. \u00c2\u00a0Even the service is well above average for Singapore standards. \u00c2\u00a0You won't leave disappointed!","485":"Yum!While visiting Singapore I had been looking for a place with decent food along the Quay's. Found this via Yelp and while it is up inside the Clarke Mall there is still a view of the river and action below. I think I arrived rather late for dinner on a weeknight, but there was no wait (i was alone) and was seated immediately. I ordered one of the set menu's with prawns, ramen and salad etc and it was A LOT of food! Probably enough for two. It was so much that i couldn't finish and they asked me \u00c2\u00a0upon checkout if everything was OK. I thought that was nice they were concerned, but it was DELICIOUS I just couldn't eat it all! Atmosphere is pretty standard, but service and food was above average. I would recommend for lunch or dinner!","486":"One of the best ramen in Singapore! Tucked away and hard to find but worth the hunt. Had the Kara-Miso vegetable ramen and it was delicious. Lightly spicy, not too salty or oily, just the way I like it. Give this place a try if you haven't already.","487":"I'm only home for 1.5 weeks and I have a long list of things I want to eat. Singapore is known for being a culinary haven. If you are a foodie, come to Singapore. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. With so many options and only 1 stomach, I had to make very smart and wise decisions. Every food choice is strategic. It has to be the best if not why bother. There are tons of ramen places in San Francisco Bay Area. However, I always tell my friends nothing beats the options and quality available in Singapore. Outside Japan, I think Singapore is probably the only country with the most ramen shops per square mile. There is fierce competition. I researched and read reviews, strategically planning which ramen shop to go to. Santouka was my final pick! Oh boy!! I was blown away. The egg was perfectly cooked. Nicely set egg white and gooey, soft egg yolk. The shio broth was flavorful and not overly greasy. You can pretty much drink up all the broth and not feel coagulated fat swimming in your stomach. The noodle texture was great and it did soak up some of the flavor from the broth. The pork jowl ... OMG ... and OMG one more time!! one bite and I felt my life is now compete! Well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It tasted better than the pork jowl I had at Lazy Bear recently. I've been to Japan numerous times, ate many bowls of ramen. I must say I'm in love with Santouka ramen.","488":"Good ramen and soup at good value. Nice views too.I really like the Kara miso ramen. Better then my expectation. Naturally I finished the bowl or noodles and the soup. Never one to waste. My friend had the normal miso soup base, apparently it taste just as good. The gyoza is surprisingly moist inside and the skin is very thin. I think they got the balance right.The service is prompt and attentive. Too bad they only allow downsizing of the noodles but no upsizing. I love good noodles so its a bit disappointing.The afternoon sunny view of the river is a bonus. I bet it looks better at night with all the Clarke Quay neon!","489":"For a delicious, fulfilling ramen quick-fix, come here.I always get the pork cheek and shio ramen, but my friend who had the miso was quite disappointed as the miso base doesn't taste much of miso. In my opinion, the only flavors that should be on the menu are spicy miso and shio. One word: SHIOK!","490":"Yelp brought me here.I was staying in the area so it was a short walk for me to come here for lunch on a rainy day.I'm not a huge fan of ramen but wanted to see what the rave was about. It was great... broth and noodles where perfect and I ate everything.I'm giving it a 4 star because of the price point... I think it was on the expensive side and ramen isn't expensive. Also it took me awhile to find the location as it's hidden.If you're in the central or clarke quay and looking for ramen come back here.I'm a fan!","491":"my favourite ramen in the many ramen chains here.Love shoyu. While other broth pales in comparison, or stinks of pork bones that I seriously considered conversion of my religion, santouka has a delicious soup base.Strangely enough, I could do without the pork cheeks. I am just contented with the soup.It's nice and rainy now. coming to this page is agony to my tummy :(","492":"Located in the purple zone and also a corner of Central is Ramen Santouka. This was their first outlet in Singapore. Their second outlet resides in Cuppage Plaza in Orchard Road. Santouka's founder Hitoshi Hatanaka opened his own ramen shop at Hokkaido in 1988 because he was unsatisfied with all other ramen establishments. Its thin-noodle ramen with elegant broth topped perfectly with mouthwatering slices of char-siu pork and pickled plums gained popularity in Hokkaido immediately. Now in 2015, there's outlets of Ramen Santouka all across the globe and my friends even mentioned the outlet in LA, tasted better than the outlet in Singapore!Looking through the menu you realize that you get to pick your soup base. Be it, Shoyu (soy sauce flavour), Miso (soybean) , Shio (Salt flavour), or Kara-Miso (spicy soybean at $1 more). The dining area of Ramen Santouka is a rather elongated one, that stretches into the kitchen. The chef is able to see every customer who walks in and walks out. And for every customer that walks out, the chef will say thank you for patronizing them. It is very typical of Japanese ramen shops in Japan to be small and compact, so that the chefs are also able to witness the customer's experience with their ramen.Miso Ramen (Medium ) $13.50+I went with my lone favourite Miso. I admit, the bowl looked small, but it was deep. After my first few dips with my chopstick, I realized I was looking at the chance of skipping Beard Papa for desserts later! The broth itself was thick and you could see a thin layer of oil swimming on the top. It wasn't too gerlat, as much I managed to drink quite a bit of the soup. The noodles are the winner here. They are extremely springy. Similar to that of maggie noodles and yet without the waxy exterior that instant noodles give you. The texture of the noodles were consistent throughout the entire serving. \u00c2\u00a0The bambo shoots here were also crunchy and since they absorbed all the flavour from the soup, they sure were tasty!The two glorious slices of char siew weren't fatty at all. Instead they were tender pieces of juicy meat, that again, absorbed all the goodness from the soup.I enjoyed my bowl of ramen as it didn't have me craving for water like the ramen from other
