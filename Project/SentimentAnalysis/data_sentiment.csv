271,CafÃ© Iguana,other selection include a gluten free ancho chile chocolate cake dollar 14 and churros dollar 12 but the former two banana dessert are more satisfying for the buck and calorie spice wise the dish are tuned to a temperate palette yet there were moment during the feast when i thought i wa eating indian briyani,2015-06-17T00:00:00,1

1401,Odette,not quite five star but a solid four my benchmark for fine dining in sg will always be andre and unfortunately julien ha yet to step out of his shadow their space at the national gallery is a class act but not anywhere a panoramic a jaan still you will impress your date if you bring one their delightfully friendly and accommodating service team will further ensure you and yours are well taken care of the pacing of the tasting menu wa fine with enough time to take that perfect food porn and with free wifi enabling you to upload instantly to yelp a for the food some dish the egg the cepe tea and the dessert were just too similar to jaan nothing necessarily wrong but just a tad bit boring for my picky palate the artisan bread selection with unsalted butter prosciutto and lard spread will stave off any hunger pang and increase serotonin to such level leading to happiness the heirloom beetroot variation wa a standout dish for me i might well turn vegetarian if all non meat dish taste a such beautiful to both eye and mouth the seafood dish were also noteworthy fresh simple ingredient assembled with complexity dessert whilst satiating were nothing mind blowing so maybe i will try their cheese supplement next time now lo and behold this is something that grandma odette can be proud of,2015-11-28T00:00:00,5
